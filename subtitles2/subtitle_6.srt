1
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,316
General, the princess's convoy
has entered our realm.

2
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,109
Prepare to receive them.

3
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:42,569
Prepare to receive them!

4
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,987
Prepare to receive them!

5
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:32,575
General Meng Yi of Qin
welcomes Your Highness.

6
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,829
May it please Her Highness.

7
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,006
His Imperial Majesty decrees...

8
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:57,515
that Princess Ok Soo
shall be Concubine Li of Qin,

9
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,768
for our nations' mutual
peace and harmony.

10
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,687
This is what Princess Ok Soo
was ordered to do.

11
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,509
My orders are to bring back
Princess Ok Soo.

12
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,890
Whoever interferes shall die!

13
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,560
Her Royal Highness
is now Concubine Li of Qin.

14
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,979
Whoever dares to go against this order
is an enemy of our state!

15
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:54,694
They leave us no alternative.

16
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,029
Prepare to attack.

17
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,910
Ready defenses.

18
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:03,994
Ready defenses!

19
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,362
Hurry! Protect the Princess!

20
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,702
Hurry! Get away from this place!

21
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,933
Please come back with me.

22
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,561
You are already my betrothed.

23
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,189
I cannot go back with you.

24
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,527
I cannot abide you
marrying the moribund emperor.

25
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,448
It's a surrender
of our sovereignty to Qin!

26
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,867
I was forced into this decision.

27
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:43,286
Please understand.

28
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:47,706
You are a general!
How can you taint my honor?

29
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:20,071
Come!

30
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,615
My mission is to protect the princess.

31
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,997
Draw your sword.
Let's both fulfill

32
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:32,708
our missions.

33
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,516
Protect the princess.

34
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,065
Save her!

35
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,111
Run!

36
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,661
Your Highness!

37
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:42,163
28 Feb 2005

38
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:46,209
I have had the same dream
for months now.

39
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,171
This time, I'm an ancient general

40
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:53,841
leading a vast army...

41
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:57,511
to rescue...

42
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,138
some sort of princess.

43
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,892
I fell off a cliff...

44
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,524
Hello? William?

45
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:14,736
You're back in Hong Kong?
Great! Come on over!

46
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:24,495
Talk about being at sea!

47
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:26,455
Why are you living on a barge?

48
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,749
The research budget
was cut in half last year.

49
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,961
With the project unfinished,
I had to sell the flat.

50
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,506
So, I moved here with my study.

51
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:39,009
It's not so bad!
Pretty roomy here.

52
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,385
So why are you back suddenly?

53
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,804
You didn't like the United States?

54
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,181
I came to solve your financial problems.

55
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,062
I want you to do something for me.

56
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,983
<i>Hi, William! This must be Dr. Chan.</i>

57
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,360
Just call me Jack.

58
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,281
<i>I'm Maggie. Welcome to our
Anti-Gravity Research Project.</i>

59
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,785
- Anti-Gravity?
- This is my lab. Check it out.

60
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,080
<i>Let's ask Dr. Smith
to give a little demonstration.</i>

61
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,267
<i>These are very expensive experiments.</i>

62
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:36,438
<i>Quite impractical,
and unusable on living subjects</i>

63
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,733
<i>as no living creature
can survive such speed.</i>

64
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,990
I don't understand.
You're a physicist,

65
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,826
I'm an archaeologist.
How can I help you?

66
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:54,038
I'm seeking a breakthrough
in the field of mysterious phenomena.

67
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,416
Remember that paper you wrote?

68
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,837
Over 2,000 years ago,
there was a tiny kingdom south of Dasar

69
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:04,881
whose king became immortal after death.

70
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,717
His coffin floated in mid-air.

71
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,553
Your paper inspired me.

72
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,055
It's just a myth.

73
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,556
I can even lend you comic books
about this.

74
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:17,727
Lots of things are called myths
prior to empirical verification.

75
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,940
Wireless telephony
was a myth 150 years ago.

76
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:26,818
So was the airplane,
and landing on the moon!

77
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,779
Even 50 years ago,

78
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:31,115
computer and digital technology
were a myth.

79
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:34,409
Many people are competing
to develop this technology.

80
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,411
If I succeed,

81
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:38,163
I'll change human history.

82
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,665
This technology could be vital
to our lives,

83
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,295
to surface and air transportation,
even inter-galactic travel!

84
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:51,342
I know you've always wanted
to do something great.

85
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,971
No one's ever entered
this ancient tomb before.

86
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:57,765
But my work is archaeology,
and I have my ethic.

87
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,684
I do research, not raid tombs.

88
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,484
You still can't forget

89
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,904
that incident, after all these years?

90
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:15,157
There are things you never forget.

91
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:22,705
We haven't played in ages.

92
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,707
How's your game?

93
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,711
Jack!

94
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,592
Don't you practice anymore?

95
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,345
Of course I do, but I just
never shot from this angle before.

96
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:41,348
- So why shoot?
- Because you passed it to me.

97
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:42,724
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

98
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:46,520
That Maggie is your girlfriend?

99
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,690
No. She represents my sponsor.
By the way, what happened to Monica?

100
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,026
Monica? Forget her.

101
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:55,903
I've been dreaming about a princess.

102
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,323
Her name's Ok Soo.

103
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,741
I called out her name in my sleep.

104
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,827
How do you think Monica took it?

105
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,788
Now, back to business.

106
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,874
Jack, you've never been
a stickler for rules.

107
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,126
You've always trusted your instincts.

108
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:15,047
Instincts helped you
unravel the Dead Sea Scrolls forgery...

109
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,965
Jack, hey...

110
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,550
Jack!

111
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:24,513
Jack!

112
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,975
Do as your instincts tell you.

113
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,310
I want to prove it's not a myth,

114
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:31,437
but something real.

115
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:41,822
You're my best friend.

116
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,659
I trust you won't let me
face danger alone.

117
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,954
Ever tried hitting a golf shot like this?

118
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,032
Jack!

119
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:30,326
- What's with you?
- I think I've got heat stroke.

120
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,036
Almost there. Come on!

121
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,996
Don't lie to me now.

122
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,916
You should exercise more regularly.

123
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,794
I do! Three hours of golf each day,

124
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,754
two hours of tennis...

125
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,964
And another dozen hours a day
playing video games.

126
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,424
You'll go blind in no time.

127
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,926
If you're so fit, why don't you carry me?

128
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,469
You can walk. Hurry Up.

129
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,471
We won't get in if we're late!

130
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:02,190
Jack, that's the holy man who can fly?

131
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,733
Yes. Let's go over there.

132
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,614
He really can fly...

133
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,292
Get up. Follow me.

134
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,129
Hey, up, up.

135
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,757
- Hurry.
- Give me a hand.

136
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,133
Grab hold of my leg!

137
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,347
- You've got strong legs.
- Let go!

138
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,684
Wow! Nice stone carvings!

139
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,062
You have no idea
how many stories they tell.

140
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,022
I didn't come this far
on my last expedition.

141
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,501
Jack!

142
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:20,096
The stone coffin's floating here.

143
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,100
- Zoom in and see if it's suspended.
- I'm working on it already.

144
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:26,144
Jack,

145
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:29,439
there's a sword beside the coffin.

146
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,024
I can see it.

147
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:35,486
I think the inscription
records his deeds.

148
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:39,532
"Mission to Qin"?

149
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,786
"This prince once brought treasures
and women to Qin.

150
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:48,040
The Qin Emperor gifted him
one of his concubines,

151
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:53,211
but he picked the emperor's favorite.

152
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,965
The emperor reneged
and gave him her painting instead,

153
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:01,386
as well as the Qin Star Gem in apology.

154
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:06,516
The prince even fought against
Qin's greatest warrior,

155
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,101
exchanging swords with him."

156
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,528
- Hey! Don't!
- What?

157
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:31,581
Jack!

158
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,001
- Are you all right?
- What did you just move?

159
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:38,754
I've never seen stones like these.

160
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:40,840
I want some for research.

161
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,633
I told you not to steal anything!

162
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,052
I was going to return it afterwards.

163
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,304
It almost cost me my life!

164
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:51,641
How come the coffin fell
as soon as I pulled it out?

165
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,627
His Majesty requested me

166
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,005
to paint a portrait of Concubine Li
as a gift to the Prince of Dasar.

167
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,258
If she won't smile, how can I paint?

168
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,846
I've not seen her smile since she arrived.

169
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,932
General Meng!

170
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:57,871
Excellent!

171
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,916
That's the smile!

172
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:06,587
Jack!

173
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:10,508
Stop dreaming!
I hear footsteps!

174
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,848
- Quick! Lift it up!
- Why don't you ask them to help?

175
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:38,952
Jack!

176
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,369
Help me!

177
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:52,756
Come on! Let go!

178
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:36,715
Hey.

179
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,326
Who are you?

180
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,537
Why come and desecrate our sacred temple?

181
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,289
What do you gain by this?

182
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,463
I just came in to look for something,

183
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,966
I didn't mean to wreck the coffin.

184
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,052
It was an accident.

185
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,470
Sorry.

186
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,688
Are you all right?

187
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:37,564
I was apologizing.

188
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:40,067
How was I to know?
I was trying to help.

189
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,609
- Let's go.
- Wait.

190
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,320
I told you not to steal.

191
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,572
It's for protection.

192
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:49,617
Let's go, Jack!

193
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:52,579
- I took the painting for you as well.
- What?

194
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:01,337
Run.

195
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:10,136
- Jack!
- Wait.

196
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:24,817
Get up. Let's go.

197
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,170
Jack!

198
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,630
Didn't you say you had backup?

199
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:49,465
All I see are monkeys!

200
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,180
You get on board first.

201
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:03,896
Jack!

202
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,327
It is too dangerous,
we have to leave now!

203
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:21,913
Come on! Jack!
Fly a bit lower!

204
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,206
No! We are hit! Let's go!

205
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,919
Jack! Jack!

206
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,130
Jack!

207
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:23,930
Thank God!

208
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:40,946
Concubine Li!

209
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:45,242
Concubine Li!

210
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,622
Your Highness,
forgive my lapse in your protection.

211
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,479
Halt!
Lay down your sword!

212
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:01,815
or I'll kill her!

213
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:11,073
Don't!

214
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:15,118
If only one can live,
I'd rather it be you.

215
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,252
Drop it!

216
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,142
General!

217
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:55,574
- General Meng Yi!
- Don't help me.

218
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,159
I'm beneath your station.

219
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:03,289
Why do you
risk your life for me?

220
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,960
A blade is forged
to drink the blood of enemies.

221
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:11,171
I am like a blade,
destined to fight for His Majesty,

222
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:13,257
and die for my country.

223
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:17,052
You are now Concubine Li of Qin.
Protecting you is my duty.

224
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,554
Your Highness has suffered a fright.

225
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,600
With you beside me,

226
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:25,519
I'm not afraid of anything.

227
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,193
We cannot stay here.
We must leave quickly.

228
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:04,207
Meng Yi...

229
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,710
General Meng Yi!

230
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,720
General, come in.

231
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:24,393
Meng Yi...

232
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:37,280
Meng Yi? General Meng Yi?

233
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,831
You promised to protect me.
You can't die!

234
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:15,191
Meng Yi?

235
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:18,694
Meng Yi? Meng Yi...

236
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:30,246
I have nothing

237
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:32,082
left in this world.

238
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,792
Not even a relative.

239
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,906
Please don't abandon me!

240
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:11,494
I have nothing left but you.

241
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:15,081
Please don't leave me alone!

242
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:11,717
General Meng Yi.

243
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,469
Over here, quickly.

244
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,730
This is the first time
I've felt so free.

245
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:27,732
No courtly rites and regulations.

246
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:30,319
What a beautiful feeling.

247
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,447
This is the first time
I've seen Your Highness smile.

248
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,952
- Why don't you look at me?
- Your humble servant does not dare.

249
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:43,497
Don't say such things.

250
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,208
Don't take away this feeling.

251
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,669
I'll stop calling you general.

252
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:51,255
How's that, Meng Yi?

253
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:04,517
I want to dance.
Shall I dance for you?

254
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,062
No, Your Highness. You mustn't.

255
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,397
In this world, only the emperor
himself may watch.

256
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,399
This is a dance

257
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,025
for you alone.

258
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:45,405
Please, Your Highness.

259
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,391
We have reached the Great Wall.

260
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,269
This is entirely our realm.

261
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,315
Our capital, Xianyang
is just over the hill.

262
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:26,402
You are now safe, Concubine Li.

263
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:30,740
I have finally
accomplished my mission.

264
00:46:33,743 --> 00:46:34,743
No!

265
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:36,703
I don't want to go to Xianyang.

266
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:40,499
Take me away.
Take me anywhere.

267
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,376
I only want to be with you.

268
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,712
I don't want to marry the emperor.

269
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,566
Why did we struggle to stay alive,

270
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:12,029
just to become slaves to destiny?

271
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:16,949
When will we ever...

272
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,494
be free?

273
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,290
Not until the day we die?

274
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:44,184
Ok Soo... Concubine Li...
Your Highness, please calm down.

275
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:45,644
Don't forget

276
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:47,854
your own mission.

277
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:49,981
You must live for the sake
of your people.

278
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:52,692
Only with life is there hope.

279
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:55,653
Promise me,

280
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:57,530
you will live!

281
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:02,284
You would have me live
in such agony?

282
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:07,081
Very well.

283
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:10,875
Very well. I promise you.

284
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:17,173
I'll live for you.

285
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:29,757
You! Freeze!

286
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:07,895
I'm levitating!

287
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,128
Mid-air coffee.

288
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,138
Maggie!

289
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:45,681
Don't!

290
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:55,149
Hello?

291
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:58,152
Jack. Our project has succeeded.

292
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:01,363
Well, almost!

293
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:03,698
What? It's a meteorite?

294
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,202
- Outside our solar system?
- <i>That's right.</i>

295
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:10,539
<i>We must now find the rest of them.</i>

296
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:13,166
<i>Where's the painting from the coffin?</i>

297
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,584
It's here with me.

298
00:56:15,168 --> 00:56:17,170
I'm going to Xian. Meet me there.

299
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:19,713
Bring the painting with you.

300
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,424
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Good. See you soon.

301
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:26,804
I'm coming with you.

302
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:05,591
I believe it was forged
some time during the Qin dynasty,

303
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,470
This type of scale-like surface material

304
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,013
is found only in Qin-dynasty artifacts.

305
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,808
Looking at the design and decorations,

306
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:18,769
I'd say it belonged to a Qin general.

307
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:20,896
This is a national treasure.

308
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:24,609
Be careful.

309
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,740
Wait. What are you doing?

310
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,199
The sword is ours!

311
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,784
Jack has bequeathed it to our museum.

312
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,957
Our foundation financed this project.

313
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,502
Anything found
should belong to the foundation.

314
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,420
How can you donate the sword
to the museum?

315
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:49,132
The sword's a grade one national relic.
It belongs to all of humanity.

316
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:52,802
It's only right we return it to a museum
where it can be seeing by everybody.

317
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,888
Anyway, what's key to the project
are the meteorites.

318
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,266
These two artifacts
have nothing to do with them.

319
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,809
Before my experiments
draw a conclusion,

320
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:02,936
anything may prove
to be a critical link.

321
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:05,022
How can you prejudge it
by saying otherwise?

322
00:58:05,355 --> 00:58:06,982
My experiments will benefit all mankind.

323
00:58:07,357 --> 00:58:10,819
Artifacts are old, dead things.
They have no life, no future!

324
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:13,821
What science is concerned with
is precisely the future!

325
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,407
Fine, if that's what you say,

326
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:17,742
then how come these
2,000 year-old artifacts

327
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:19,243
are so important to you?

328
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,203
I risked my life for that sword!

329
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:22,372
That was me.

330
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:29,711
Okay! In that case,
when I find the meteorites,

331
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:31,839
- you'll still give them away?
- Yes.

332
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:35,467
As long as it's someone else's artifacts,
I'll return them.

333
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,804
No one can plunder relics
from someone else's country

334
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,472
and put them in their own museums.

335
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:43,517
They call it "safe-keeping,"
but it's theft.

336
00:58:43,642 --> 00:58:44,976
It's despicable behavior.

337
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:49,647
So, what are we going to do now?

338
00:58:51,816 --> 00:58:52,900
What can I do?

339
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:02,743
William.

340
00:59:03,953 --> 00:59:06,789
Do you want to meet your sponsor
for these last ten years?

341
00:59:07,873 --> 00:59:10,292
Of course.
But he doesn't want to see me.

342
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,336
I'll bring you to him now.

343
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,088
- Right now?
- Come with me.

344
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,098
I'll return these relics
to Dasar for you.

345
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,059
Thank you.

346
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:47,660
Professor Koo?

347
00:59:48,286 --> 00:59:49,454
It's you?

348
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:51,956
It's been years since I was a professor.

349
01:00:01,674 --> 01:00:04,510
Mr. Koo, you've been
funding my work

350
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,637
all these years?

351
01:00:07,013 --> 01:00:07,888
That's right.

352
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,099
I had my eye on you
even before you graduated.

353
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:15,896
Maggie, cancel my contract
with the foundation.

354
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,108
I won't accept sponsorship
from a tomb-raiding "archaeologist."

355
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,533
And you and Jack
weren't raiding tombs in Dasar?

356
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:36,123
I've unearthed many treasures
in my lifetime.

357
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:41,711
But the best ones I found
are you and Jack.

358
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,257
- Don't you hate him?
- No.

359
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:49,678
Even if he has hurt me deeply.

360
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:57,101
So what do you want from me?

361
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:01,355
Stay with Jack.

362
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:03,942
Follow him.

363
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,319
Enlighten him.

364
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:10,989
He'll make you
the world's greatest scientist.

365
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:14,326
Isn't that your life's dream?

366
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:23,793
"The 36th year of the emperor's reign.

367
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:27,339
A star fell on the eastern province,
and turned to stone on Earth."

368
01:01:27,505 --> 01:01:28,881
{\an8}RECORDS OF THE GRAND HISTORIAN

369
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:31,175
{\an8}"The meteorite was engraved..."

370
01:01:31,843 --> 01:01:34,095
"...<i>with a curse on the emperor.</i>

371
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:38,682
<i>So the emperor tried to kill everyone
around him...</i>

372
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:44,480
<i>to keep the secret
of the meteorite intact."</i>

373
01:02:04,749 --> 01:02:07,042
Look! General Nangong's returned!

374
01:02:08,753 --> 01:02:09,920
Out of the way!

375
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:23,308
Report to the general at once!

376
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:35,153
How is my father?

377
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:39,032
How is His Majesty?

378
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,700
Report!

379
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:44,787
General Nangong has returned
with important intelligence.

380
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,429
Well,

381
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:04,180
how is His Majesty?

382
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:06,433
His Majesty's...

383
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:11,603
General,

384
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,272
the Immortal Pill is ready.

385
01:03:13,439 --> 01:03:17,151
On his way back,
General Xu was ambushed by rebels.

386
01:03:19,403 --> 01:03:20,778
Prepare the troops for departure.

387
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:21,738
Yes, sir.

388
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:23,865
- Fresh horses!
- Yes sir!

389
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:28,870
If word gets out,
your whole clan will be executed!

390
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:32,207
Your servant wouldn't dare!

391
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,672
Please tell the Chancellor

392
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:42,633
I don't know anything.
I'll never tell!

393
01:03:43,468 --> 01:03:44,885
I don't know anything.

394
01:03:48,973 --> 01:03:51,016
Father had too many
people around him.

395
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,601
I fear for our plans.

396
01:03:53,102 --> 01:03:55,604
The concubines are ready
to be entombed with him.

397
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:07,698
Your Majesty, the Immortal Pill is ready,

398
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:09,699
but was taken in a rebel ambush.

399
01:04:09,784 --> 01:04:11,994
Your servant begs leave
to go retrieve it forthwith!

400
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:14,497
General Meng,
your duty is His Majesty's safety.

401
01:04:15,038 --> 01:04:16,290
You should stay.

402
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,668
The situation is most urgent!

403
01:04:20,293 --> 01:04:21,795
I await His Majesty's orders.

404
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,721
His Majesty commands you
to retrieve the pill.

405
01:04:32,555 --> 01:04:34,015
- As ordered!
- Wait.

406
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:39,729
His Majesty has few troops
in his entourage.

407
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:43,650
If you go all out for the pill,

408
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,985
and the rebels strike,

409
01:04:46,277 --> 01:04:48,737
I fear for His Majesty's safety.

410
01:04:49,613 --> 01:04:54,493
In that case,
I'll only take the Light Cavalry.

411
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:04,878
I won't tell.

412
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:07,713
His Majesty still needs treatment.

413
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:09,882
Let me try once more.

414
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,645
General Meng Yi!

415
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:32,362
Farewell, Your Highness.

416
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,531
You must come back.

417
01:05:36,908 --> 01:05:38,827
The pill can save His Majesty's life,

418
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,620
and therefore yours too.

419
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,250
Know that my heart
is yours forever.

420
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,267
I await your return.

421
01:06:08,688 --> 01:06:10,398
Attention, soldiers of the Meng clan!

422
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:12,442
Those with aged parents are excused!

423
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:16,320
The only sons are excused!

424
01:06:21,868 --> 01:06:23,369
Husbands and fathers are excused!

425
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:30,166
Those who are excused, guard the camp!
The rest of you, mount!

426
01:06:34,755 --> 01:06:35,797
General!

427
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:38,884
How many years
have we shared our honor?

428
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,469
Why can we not
live and die together now?

429
01:06:44,097 --> 01:06:47,099
I, Nangong Yan swears to follow you
even unto death!

430
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:56,316
We swear to follow the General!

431
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:58,402
We swear to follow the General!

432
01:06:58,778 --> 01:07:00,362
We swear to follow the General!

433
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:02,322
We swear to follow the General!

434
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:04,241
We swear to follow the General!

435
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:06,368
We swear to follow the General!

436
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,972
I have orders from the Chancellor
to take the pill.

437
01:08:57,181 --> 01:09:00,934
Failure to hand it over
is disobedience, Xu Gui!

438
01:09:01,644 --> 01:09:04,104
I can only give the Pill

439
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,565
to General Meng.

440
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:08,817
I won't give to anyone else!

441
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:25,708
The Chancellor bears
His Majesty's word.

442
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,877
Obey right now!

443
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:30,087
Or die!

444
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:39,721
Prepare to attack!

445
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:44,475
Prepare to attack!

446
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:49,647
Defenses!

447
01:09:57,863 --> 01:09:59,615
Ready archers!

448
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:10,792
Fire!

449
01:10:19,468 --> 01:10:20,677
Charge!

450
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:33,314
Attack!

451
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:33,871
Zhao Kuang, His Majesty orders!
Yield at once!

452
01:11:35,831 --> 01:11:38,125
You dare fake
an Imperial Decree?

453
01:11:39,752 --> 01:11:40,961
General Meng?

454
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:44,131
Leave no one alive!

455
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:49,803
General Zhao!

456
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:51,721
General Meng comes
with an Imperial Decree!

457
01:11:52,305 --> 01:11:53,932
Why do you disobey?

458
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:57,393
Your disobedience in the field
will be punished! Attack!

459
01:12:11,156 --> 01:12:12,115
Soldiers at the back!

460
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:14,785
No one moves without my orders!

461
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:18,330
Attack!

462
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:23,808
Xu Gui!

463
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:32,275
- General Meng!
- Meng Jie?

464
01:13:32,817 --> 01:13:34,402
The Chancellor wants you dead.

465
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:36,612
Behind my troops is the only way out.

466
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:43,535
General, there's no time.
You go with Meng Jie.

467
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:44,620
I'll hold them off.

468
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:46,997
Go!

469
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,375
After them!

470
01:13:55,547 --> 01:13:56,673
Out of the way!

471
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:06,891
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

472
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:08,434
My bow!

473
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:12,063
Out of the way!
Everyone out of the way!

474
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:16,775
Out of the way!

475
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,747
Go! Hurry!

476
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:35,168
Go!

477
01:15:33,806 --> 01:15:34,974
Black Wind!

478
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:48,237
Archers, ready!

479
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,364
Fire!

480
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,751
Fire!

481
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:11,426
General!

482
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,219
Take the pill and go!

483
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,515
- General!
- The pill must reach the emperor!

484
01:16:19,433 --> 01:16:20,601
Protect Concubine Li!

485
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,687
Farewell, my General.

486
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:26,731
Go!

487
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,637
Black Wind,

488
01:16:59,554 --> 01:17:00,973
you have done your duty.

489
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:14,819
Jack.

490
01:17:15,737 --> 01:17:17,655
I am sorry. You were right.

491
01:17:18,114 --> 01:17:20,199
Those relics should be returned.

492
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:24,036
I made you something.
I hope you like it.

493
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:34,462
I looked up the geographical data
within 500 miles of Xian.

494
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,341
You once told me your dreams
of waterfalls and tunnels.

495
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:40,844
I hope this will help.

496
01:17:43,763 --> 01:17:45,390
How far is this waterfall
from Mount Li?

497
01:17:47,475 --> 01:17:48,809
About 200 kilometers.

498
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:02,072
Sensors indicate a huge cave
behind the waterfall.

499
01:18:02,197 --> 01:18:04,699
There were rainstorms one year,
and the cave never reappeared.

500
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:06,160
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

501
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:13,290
Jack, there's a cave behind the waterfall,
with a huge opening just behind it.

502
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,416
That's right.

503
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,753
A dozen years ago,
there was a drought.

504
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:18,504
The water dried up.

505
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:20,381
The cave behind the waterfall appeared,

506
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:22,341
and a foolhardy villager climbed in.

507
01:18:23,342 --> 01:18:24,718
Then it started to rain,

508
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:27,012
and the water quickly concealed
the entrance again.

509
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:29,139
The villager was never seen again.

510
01:18:30,933 --> 01:18:32,267
What do you plan to do?

511
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,394
I'm going into the waterfall.

512
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:36,688
- How?
- Get flushed in.

513
01:18:37,272 --> 01:18:38,148
You crazy?

514
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,108
That's very dangerous!

515
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,735
You don't even know

516
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:44,362
if your dream is real.

517
01:18:46,614 --> 01:18:48,825
Sure! I don't know
whether it's real or not,

518
01:18:49,283 --> 01:18:51,410
or who the person in the dream
is to me.

519
01:18:52,745 --> 01:18:54,831
But I can feel her love.

520
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:56,958
So you're saying,

521
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,668
unless you unravel this dream,
you'll never be at peace?

522
01:19:21,772 --> 01:19:23,649
What a blessed place!

523
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,152
Wind, water,
all the elements are in place.

524
01:19:29,196 --> 01:19:33,367
Jack, only you
could've brought me here.

525
01:21:02,284 --> 01:21:03,368
William, do you copy?

526
01:21:04,078 --> 01:21:05,454
Loud and clear, Jack.

527
01:21:05,913 --> 01:21:07,122
I can see you.

528
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:09,416
I'll contact you as soon as I'm in.

529
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,169
- But if...
- <i>No ifs and buts.</i>

530
01:21:13,587 --> 01:21:15,088
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

531
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,132
I'll be in touch.

532
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:20,176
Don't worry.

533
01:21:21,302 --> 01:21:23,346
Whether it's brain or brawn,

534
01:21:24,097 --> 01:21:25,556
he's your superior.

535
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:59,979
<i>Jack, what's happening?</i>

536
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:02,690
<i>Jack!</i>

537
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:04,400
<i>Jack!</i>

538
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:05,817
Are you all right?

539
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:07,736
<i>My ass hurts.</i>

540
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:22,959
William, I see an opening
with man-made designs.

541
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:24,961
<i>Like the sketches you drew?</i>

542
01:23:25,128 --> 01:23:26,504
I'll see if I can get inside.

543
01:23:27,839 --> 01:23:29,256
I will call you later.

544
01:23:32,677 --> 01:23:33,970
Get ready to begin.

545
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:36,764
Now.

546
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:09,283
Meng Yi.

547
01:26:13,912 --> 01:26:14,830
Meng Yi.

548
01:26:16,123 --> 01:26:17,625
You've finally returned.

549
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:30,387
I am your Ok Soo.

550
01:26:31,596 --> 01:26:32,972
You've finally come.

551
01:26:37,352 --> 01:26:38,436
Ok Soo...

552
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,898
is it really you?

553
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,112
You were really waiting for me.

554
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,073
Am I dreaming?

555
01:26:52,324 --> 01:26:54,034
I promised I'd live for you!

556
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:56,119
I've kept my word.

557
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,705
You kept yours too.

558
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,249
You've really returned.

559
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:24,396
Jack!

560
01:27:29,818 --> 01:27:31,861
Jack, thank you!

561
01:27:33,196 --> 01:27:34,823
Without you,

562
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,868
this secret would have been buried
for another eternity.

563
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:43,372
This place is exactly
like Jack's dream.

564
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:47,043
I can't explain it scientifically.

565
01:27:48,086 --> 01:27:53,591
There are many things in this world
that science can't explain.

566
01:27:54,675 --> 01:27:56,677
This cave stays warm the year round.

567
01:27:57,177 --> 01:27:58,929
It's shut off from the world,

568
01:27:59,304 --> 01:28:00,889
but air flows freely.

569
01:28:02,432 --> 01:28:06,228
They made massive constructions
at Mount Li,

570
01:28:06,644 --> 01:28:09,021
but dug a 100-mile tunnel

571
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:12,734
to build the mausoleum here.

572
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:16,904
Brilliant!

573
01:28:18,114 --> 01:28:20,324
A masterstroke of deception.

574
01:28:22,952 --> 01:28:25,329
But where's the entrance
to the mausoleum?

575
01:28:43,054 --> 01:28:45,723
<i>Release me

<i>From the mysterious wait

591
01:30:07,884 --> 01:30:10,053
Your Highness! Beware!

592
01:31:01,602 --> 01:31:03,437
Stop, General Nangong!

593
01:31:11,069 --> 01:31:13,030
He's Meng Yi! General Meng!

594
01:31:13,238 --> 01:31:14,572
Impossible!

595
01:31:17,116 --> 01:31:18,576
He can't be General Meng!

596
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:22,747
No warrior is General Meng's match!
How can he be him?

597
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:27,626
He really is General Meng!

598
01:31:28,169 --> 01:31:29,711
There's no mistake!

599
01:31:39,054 --> 01:31:40,389
You really are the General.

600
01:31:42,766 --> 01:31:44,142
Greetings to the General!

601
01:31:46,061 --> 01:31:48,479
Sir, I have followed your order

602
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:50,356
to protect Concubine Li

603
01:31:50,856 --> 01:31:53,151
- pending your return.
- Good.

604
01:31:56,404 --> 01:31:57,572
Mr. Koo...

605
01:32:09,874 --> 01:32:11,293
Great work, Mr. Koo!

606
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,878
You've discovered the secret
of levitation.

607
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:22,721
Weightlessness carries serious dangers.

608
01:32:23,637 --> 01:32:25,849
If we lose traction
and float off,

609
01:32:26,515 --> 01:32:29,518
we'll be adrift forever,
and turn into living fossils.

610
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,605
Hold on!

611
01:32:43,656 --> 01:32:46,201
After I left you that day,
I returned with the Pill.

612
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,496
His Majesty was barely alive,

613
01:32:49,996 --> 01:32:52,123
but Zhao Gao doubted the Pill's veracity.

614
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:54,876
He ordered me
to personally test it.

615
01:32:55,752 --> 01:32:59,338
Chancellor Li said
it was our honor

616
01:32:59,922 --> 01:33:03,259
to test the pill for the emperor,
and forced me to take it too.

617
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:08,055
And so, those
who wanted to live didn't,

618
01:33:08,597 --> 01:33:11,057
and those who wished to die
can never do so.

619
01:33:11,642 --> 01:33:15,562
General, what happened that day
after I left?

620
01:33:20,984 --> 01:33:23,904
That day, after I gave you the Pill...

621
01:33:27,782 --> 01:33:28,991
Black Wind,

622
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:30,951
you have done your duty.

623
01:34:24,711 --> 01:34:25,837
Fighting...

624
01:34:26,379 --> 01:34:27,839
by your side...

625
01:34:28,548 --> 01:34:29,382
today...

626
01:34:30,633 --> 01:34:33,427
has been my greatest honor in life.

627
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:36,513
I take my leave.

628
01:34:52,613 --> 01:34:53,697
Halt!

629
01:35:03,373 --> 01:35:04,457
Attack!

630
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:45,328
Attack!

631
01:36:55,061 --> 01:36:56,271
Surrender, General!

632
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,648
Surrender, General!

633
01:39:00,138 --> 01:39:01,389
No!

634
01:39:01,849 --> 01:39:02,724
Never!

635
01:39:04,434 --> 01:39:05,643
I won't believe it.

636
01:39:06,394 --> 01:39:08,980
If General Meng fell in battle...

637
01:39:11,774 --> 01:39:13,067
then who are you?

638
01:39:14,151 --> 01:39:15,361
I am...

639
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:32,335
Everything is as I expected.

640
01:39:47,225 --> 01:39:49,059
Life after death...

641
01:39:50,269 --> 01:39:53,063
Troops in an eternal vigil...

642
01:39:54,732 --> 01:39:56,608
I've found you at last!

643
01:39:57,902 --> 01:39:59,278
Who would have thought

644
01:39:59,653 --> 01:40:03,240
the Qin Emperor would use the meteorite
to create a weightless world?

645
01:40:10,329 --> 01:40:12,081
General, did you bring troops?

646
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:14,375
No.

647
01:40:19,838 --> 01:40:21,257
Wait for me here.

648
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,135
Be careful.

649
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,266
Who dares to trespass the mausoleum?

650
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,812
A Qin-dynasty man?

651
01:40:35,938 --> 01:40:37,105
Immortal?

652
01:40:42,068 --> 01:40:43,152
Jack!

653
01:40:43,361 --> 01:40:44,696
Are you all right?

654
01:40:45,196 --> 01:40:46,322
William!

655
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:47,865
You conned me from day one.

656
01:40:48,991 --> 01:40:50,409
You've been working for him!

657
01:40:50,743 --> 01:40:54,455
- I... I...
- Jack, I told you before.

658
01:40:55,164 --> 01:40:56,623
Greed is human nature,

659
01:40:56,707 --> 01:41:00,377
and desire for knowledge
drives us.

660
01:41:00,919 --> 01:41:06,007
I merely made use of William's greed
and your desire for knowledge.

661
01:41:06,091 --> 01:41:08,635
And now my life's work
is complete!

662
01:41:09,678 --> 01:41:13,639
When you turned me in,
I told myself...

663
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:17,852
One day, you'll make it up to me.

664
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:24,525
Jack, all I want is to take some stuff
back for experiments.

665
01:41:24,775 --> 01:41:27,069
My discoveries will benefit the world.

666
01:41:27,862 --> 01:41:30,280
I'll become the greatest scientist
of the century!

667
01:41:30,781 --> 01:41:32,282
No one can take anything from here.

668
01:41:32,782 --> 01:41:35,660
This is a part of history.
It should stay buried forever!

669
01:41:36,286 --> 01:41:38,122
Without you,

670
01:41:38,538 --> 01:41:43,460
I couldn't have solved this maze
in several lifetimes!

671
01:41:44,085 --> 01:41:45,504
Professor!

672
01:41:46,588 --> 01:41:48,047
Scoundrel!

673
01:41:48,506 --> 01:41:51,926
How dare you defile the mausoleum?
The penalty is death!

674
01:42:04,813 --> 01:42:06,231
Nangong Yan! Careful!

675
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:12,737
Don't shoot.
I want him alive.

676
01:42:40,889 --> 01:42:42,265
Take care of Ok Soo.

677
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:06,455
Where's the Immortality Pill?

678
01:43:07,622 --> 01:43:08,748
Tell me.

679
01:43:10,459 --> 01:43:11,501
Halt!

680
01:43:20,885 --> 01:43:21,970
General Nangong!

681
01:43:38,443 --> 01:43:41,780
WHEN THE DRAGON PEARL MOVES,
ANNIHILATION ENSUES

682
01:44:09,848 --> 01:44:13,435
Pull me in.
Quick, give me a hand.

683
01:44:21,609 --> 01:44:22,861
General Nangong!

684
01:44:25,196 --> 01:44:26,322
Concubine Li! Run!

685
01:44:26,739 --> 01:44:27,823
Run!

686
01:44:34,872 --> 01:44:37,082
Give me your hand! Quick!

687
01:44:39,835 --> 01:44:44,714
Use your legs.
Right, your legs.

688
01:44:55,892 --> 01:44:57,435
Pull me in.

689
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:10,948
A Qin-dynasty deputy imperial general!

690
01:45:33,678 --> 01:45:34,887
Tell me!

691
01:45:36,388 --> 01:45:38,140
Where's the Immortality Pill?

692
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:41,518
Where's the Qin Emperor's sarcophagus?

693
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:49,818
It must be in the Celestial Palace.

694
01:45:55,031 --> 01:45:56,825
Take me there! Take me there!

695
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,126
Stay where you are!

696
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:10,087
Don't you dare try
to steal anything

697
01:46:10,295 --> 01:46:11,463
or take her away!

698
01:46:12,297 --> 01:46:13,883
That depends on
whether you can stop me.

699
01:47:21,697 --> 01:47:24,533
Don't worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

700
01:47:47,722 --> 01:47:50,099
Jack! Help me!

701
01:48:03,903 --> 01:48:06,697
Ok Soo, I'll take you
away from here.

702
01:48:14,455 --> 01:48:15,498
Let's go.

703
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:39,103
Jack!

704
01:48:39,854 --> 01:48:40,730
William!

705
01:48:42,231 --> 01:48:43,733
- William!
- Help me!

706
01:48:47,861 --> 01:48:48,945
Hang on to me!

707
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:50,739
I only do scientific research.

708
01:48:51,657 --> 01:48:52,949
I'm no tomb raider.

709
01:48:56,202 --> 01:48:57,328
Jack...

710
01:49:00,498 --> 01:49:02,417
you must get out no matter what,

711
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:04,544
and finish my research.

712
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:10,133
Jack.

713
01:49:14,136 --> 01:49:16,597
Jack, are we still friends?

714
01:49:30,485 --> 01:49:31,486
Jack?

715
01:49:35,031 --> 01:49:36,866
You really aren't Meng Yi.

716
01:49:40,704 --> 01:49:41,745
No, I'm not.

717
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:47,168
Whether I'm Meng Yi or not
doesn't matter.

718
01:49:47,335 --> 01:49:49,212
What matters is that
we leave here now!

719
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,381
You're not Meng Yi.

720
01:49:54,091 --> 01:49:55,593
I'm not leaving.

721
01:49:56,259 --> 01:49:57,886
I'll await Meng Yi's return.

722
01:49:59,387 --> 01:50:00,931
Ok Soo, hurry! There's no time!

723
01:50:01,723 --> 01:50:04,101
No. He's not dead.

724
01:50:04,934 --> 01:50:06,311
I'll wait for him.

725
01:50:06,728 --> 01:50:07,729
Ok Soo!

726
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:10,022
Ok Soo!

727
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:57,234
At last! Immortality!

728
01:56:06,235 --> 01:56:07,361
General Zhao!

729
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:09,572
General Meng comes
with an Imperial Decree!

730
01:56:10,155 --> 01:56:11,657
Why do you disobey?

731
01:56:12,407 --> 01:56:14,034
The emperor is dead now,

732
01:56:14,618 --> 01:56:15,786
and you have to...

733
01:56:17,079 --> 01:56:18,080
From now on,

734
01:56:19,206 --> 01:56:20,373
we will never...

735
01:56:21,874 --> 01:56:24,169
Oh, no!

736
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:27,839
That last line... the last line!

737
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:29,131
From now on,

738
01:56:30,007 --> 01:56:32,051
we will never separate again.

739
01:56:39,183 --> 01:56:40,267
You've been lying to me!

740
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:44,563
From beginning to end,
from today onwards...

741
01:56:45,272 --> 01:56:47,899
You have been
speaking Cantonese style Mandarin

742
01:56:47,983 --> 01:56:50,110
from beginning to end.
