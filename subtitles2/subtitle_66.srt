FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,453
-Wasn't it good?
-It was the best.

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,664
-That's my point.
-So the kidsâ¦

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,039
I know a really good place.

6
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,133
The second round is on me.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,998
What do you say?

8
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,589
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go!

9
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:09,646
Even some photos
from that time make me so sad.

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,906
How is Dad facing
his 22-year-old self again?

11
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,208
Dad!

12
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,096
Dad.

13
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,952
I knewâ¦

14
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,485
that this day would come.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,540
I've always imagined.

16
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,639
My happy house

17
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:26,398
started to crumble
when that man's careful footsteps began.

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,781
Hello?

19
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,213
He was careful at first,

20
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,169
but he gradually became
more and more shameless.

21
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,224
Hello?

22
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,610
My happy house

23
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,401
turned into hell,
where I couldn't even breathe.

24
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:38,432
I decided to kill myself
as a man's wife and live as a mother.

25
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,595
I swept and wiped the house
more than a dozen times a day.

26
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,318
I had to protect my house for my kids.

27
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,083
{\an8}Did youâ¦

28
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,303
{\an8}just call me Dad?

29
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,881
{\an8}Who is she?

30
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,926
{\an8}Where's your common sense?

31
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,049
{\an8}She's obviously his wife.

32
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,005
{\an8}-Right?
-I see.

33
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,176
{\an8}I didn't expect you
to come out of there, ma'am.

34
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,893
{\an8}Come on. What's wrong with you?

35
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,727
{\an8}We all call you "Dad" here.

36
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,063
She may get the wrong idea.

37
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,815
Right.

38
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,739
Driver Kim says we're his sons
when he's drunk,

39
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,279
so we call him Dad.

40
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,242
You're a bit weird today.

41
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,492
Are you not well?

42
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,076
Wellâ¦

43
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,833
No.

44
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,461
Dad!

45
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,674
See?

46
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,250
Everyone calls him Dad here.

47
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,338
I was on my way to work,
so I'll get going.

48
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,762
Dad.

49
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,234
Have a safe trip back.

50
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,031
We should get going too.

51
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,569
-Okay.
-All right.

52
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,862
-We're leaving, Driver Kim.
-Goodbye.

53
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,179
Dad attempted suicide?

54
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,893
My Dad tried to do that

55
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,187
and leave me behind?

56
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,730
Noâ¦

57
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,975
And leave our family behind?

58
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,651
How do you know about that?

59
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,278
I got his medical chart from the hospital.

60
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,159
He was in a critical state
when he was found.

61
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,997
They couldn't even get his temperature
due to hypothermia.

62
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,249
Considering that,
he's recovering very fast.

63
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,835
When the rescuers found him,
they found a medicine bottle nearby.

64
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,260
It was almost empty,

65
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,972
but they didn't detect
any pills in his body.

66
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,391
Was it sleeping pills?

67
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,401
Yes.

68
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,229
Dad has insomnia.

69
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,818
Because his sleeping routine is irregular.

70
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,277
Are you going to overlook it?

71
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,913
You said it wasn't in his system.

72
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,738
He didn't take it.

73
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,291
Your mother knows, too.

74
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,415
She asked them if any trace of
sleeping pills were found in his body.

75
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,854
Why are you telling me now?

76
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,019
I was going to see him first
when his memories come back,

77
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,889
but I thought it'd be better if you do.

78
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,598
You should tell him.

79
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,936
An illness of the mind is also a disease.
It needs to be prescribed.

80
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,235
You tell him.

81
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:28,028
I have to go to the seminar
and it's not good to waste time.

82
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,414
I can't.

83
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,786
I know I shouldn't be like this,

84
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,581
but I hate my mom.

85
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,088
Graduation from marriage all of a sudden?

86
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,839
I hate it.

87
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,483
I have something to tell you.

88
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,946
My brother sent me photos

89
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,748
from my university days
before I came here.

90
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,670
Aren't all girls at that age pretty?

91
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,793
But I wasn't pretty.

92
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,463
I think I look better now.

93
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,465
You're not laughing.

94
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,386
I also broke up
after nine years of dating.

95
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,559
He cheated on me.

96
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,816
He was dating another woman
for three years,

97
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,817
but I didn't know.

98
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,078
I wonder what the man who dated me
for nine years told her about me.

99
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,713
Did he tell her
we were drifting apart slowly?

100
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,588
Did he tell her
that our relationship was ending?

101
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,840
Were you disappointed because I said that?

102
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,668
Disappointedâ¦

103
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,144
It was arrogant.

104
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,602
I was just being honest.

105
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
Why do I sense confidence?

106
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,055
I was worried about what you might say,

107
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,185
but I'm relieved.

108
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,322
I didn't say it to relieve you.

109
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,439
Think from a different point of view.

110
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,696
Dating for nine years
isn't a common experience.

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,070
But we're similar in that way as well.

112
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,870
Isn't this fate?

113
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,156
You know from experience

114
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,286
that nine years is just a matter of time.

115
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,294
Drifting apart,
starting to hate each other,

116
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,550
and expecting nothing from each other.

117
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,220
You'd understand my situation so well,

118
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,879
so I feel at ease.

119
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,008
Are you saying
I'll keep your secrets and hide

120
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,636
because I understand it?

121
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,854
No.

122
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,102
I never wanted you
to keep the secret or hide.

123
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,016
I will keep the secret
and hide completely,

124
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,147
and will not care
about what situation you two are in.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,490
So we canâ¦

126
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,744
keep seeing each other?

127
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,032
I will do as I wish.

128
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,445
Yes. Do as you wish, Eun-hee.

129
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,449
Before that, I have a favor to ask you.

130
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,826
Show me the photos your brother sent you.

131
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,714
I'm so curious.

132
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,021
You were pretty.

133
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,646
You said you weren't pretty
to make me curious.

134
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,820
This is not pretty.

135
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,689
I'm frowning without knowing
how wonderful that age was.

136
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,372
By the way, your brother
is a great photographer.

137
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,910
My brother didn't take it.

138
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,458
Oh.

139
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,498
Why are you making that sound?

140
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,833
My friend took it.

141
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,344
That friend from last time.

142
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,887
I wasn't going to say this,
but I'm a good photographer myself.

143
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,263
I can take it better than this.

144
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,846
-I'll take it.
-I don't like taking photos.

145
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,932
-Come on.
-No.

146
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,477
Here we go. One, twoâ¦

147
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,747
Should I have opened
a wedding photography studio?

148
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,140
What a nice photo.

149
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,431
How do you know Chan-hyuk?

150
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,933
My mom and his mom know each other.

151
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,889
That's why I started working for him.

152
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,807
It's sort of nepotism.

153
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,015
That applies to me too then.

154
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,113
At least you studied abroad.

155
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,276
I have to try really hard.

156
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,241
I got kicked out
even without finishing one year.

157
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,662
I didn't really study abroad.

158
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,043
Don't ask with those eyes.

159
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,035
No.

160
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,298
I need to ask.

161
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,548
I'm sick of that damn curiosity.

162
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,926
If we become social media friends
and surf around,

163
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,300
you'll hear ridiculous rumors soon.

164
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,427
No, not that.

165
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,062
If you're working after getting
kicked out in less than a yearâ¦

166
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,556
How old are you?

167
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,244
I was born in 1995.

168
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,412
What about you?

169
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,367
When we empty these glasses,

170
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,536
let's speak casually at the same time.

171
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,101
What on earth are you thinking?

172
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,779
Who is it?

173
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,119
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,377
I'm really drunk.

175
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,336
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,625
I'm leaving.

177
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,511
I shouldn't stop you, right?

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,820
The photo I showed you earlier.

179
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,363
At that time,

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,870
I wasn't happy.

181
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,909
Good job. See you tomorrow.

182
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,332
I'll move this.

183
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,830
But it's heavy.

184
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,542
It's light.

185
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,961
Back then,

186
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,631
-I was independent.
-I'm so sorry.

187
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,419
-See you tomorrow.
-I was free.

188
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,207
I was always bright,
whenever and wherever.

189
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,679
I exhausted myself
to be the great girlfriend

190
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,345
who didn't restrain her boyfriend.

191
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,182
Why?

192
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,385
Because that's how
I've been living my life.

193
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,270
I wanted to impress people

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,564
and be a good person to others.

195
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,862
I was in a relationship
with that personality.

196
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,153
Imagine how much I tried to impress him.

197
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,317
You don't have to do that to me.

198
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,445
Exactly.

199
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,333
I'm doing everything as I wish.

200
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,083
I'm leaving because I want to leave.

201
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,084
Bye.

202
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,084
Eun-hee.

203
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,130
Try to find the root of your personality.

204
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,632
What a clichÃ© prescription.

205
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,263
You want something more clichÃ©?

206
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,303
If you talk to someone about it,

207
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,467
it gets easier.

208
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,603
I do have a private safe
that I talk to about everything.

209
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,862
If you go over there

210
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,435
you can see the place where I always sit.

211
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,647
I'm so happy to be with you, Ms. Sook.

212
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,905
You're good at finding your way
in the complex alleys.

213
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:24,288
We had both Eun-joo and Eun-hee
when you started truck driving.

214
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,246
You said it was your first time
going to Ulsan.

215
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,224
Andâ¦

216
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,800
you know the area well?

217
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,311
You're lying about not remembering, right?

218
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,029
-Where's Ji-woo?
-Restroom.

219
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,858
You should've told me
he can't handle alcohol.

220
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,621
Thank you.

221
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,367
Chan-hyuk.

222
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,585
We decided to speak casually
with each other.

223
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,842
She got the wrong idea
about you liking Eun-hee

224
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,969
because you had her photo.

225
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,385
I told her

226
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:25,482
that you and Eun-hee
don't have that kind of relationship.

227
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,782
Why?

228
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,622
Why are you so certain?

229
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,658
Oh.

230
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,994
Is it wrong for me to be certain?

231
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,498
No, you can be certain.

232
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,919
But there must be a reason
why you're so certain.

233
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,996
I've seen you guys for a long time

234
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,456
and I never felt anything like that.

235
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,255
What an absurd certainty.

236
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,763
Family. Friends. Lovers.

237
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,345
It's easier to trick those
you've known for a long time.

238
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,733
Right.

239
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,940
Family members trick each other.

240
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,784
Right.

241
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,612
When are you going to
meet my eldest sister?

242
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,867
That's hot.

243
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,948
Why are you mentioning
your eldest sister all of a sudden?

244
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,752
I love my eldest sister so much.

245
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,054
My eldest sister.

246
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,550
A doctor's wife.

247
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,468
Ulsanâ¦

248
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,353
is my hometown.

249
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,982
I was orphaned at the age of 14.

250
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:57,026
I felt like I was going to starve
to death and wasn't sure about life.

251
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,914
So I started helping truck drivers load
and unload, and I came to Seoul.

252
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,495
You were a university student,

253
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,344
and you were so pretty and wonderful.

254
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,551
I knew I wasn't a good match.

255
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,642
So I learned the Seoul dialect
so as not to seem like country folk.

256
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,098
I could've grown taller,

257
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,312
but I starved a lot at the time.

258
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,403
I was so nervous about when to tell you

259
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,534
but I guessâ¦

260
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,990
I didn't tell you until I got this old.

261
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,708
Butâ¦

262
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,707
I really don't remember.

263
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,455
Our son-in-law said
my memories will come back soon,

264
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,224
so please believe me.

265
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,603
Let's go back before the last bus leaves.

266
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,399
If the last bus leaves,

267
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,565
we can spend the night here

268
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,149
and see the sunrise together.

269
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,736
I can't get used to this.

270
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,322
Ms. Sook.

271
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,909
Ms. Sook.

272
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Ms. Sook.

273
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,998
Ms. Sook!

274
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,536
Ms. Sook!

275
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,590
Ms. Sook!

276
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,619
What's so great
about the poor and hungry days?

277
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,673
I forgot about it.

278
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,380
Don't remember anything.

279
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,144
You know the story of the fairy
and the woodcutter, right?

280
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,059
The fairy had two children,

281
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,066
so she flew up to the sky
with each of them in her hands.

282
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,778
Youâ¦

283
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,243
were like a fairy that came to me,

284
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,405
so I was always scared
that you might fly away.

285
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,747
That's whyâ¦

286
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,920
I decided that I will have

287
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,706
three kids.

288
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,591
Our kids

289
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,345
are not like me.

290
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,429
They studied a lot,

291
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,020
and they grew up into wonderful

292
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,984
and beautiful people.

293
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,147
Ms. Sook.

294
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,866
You've done so much.

295
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,163
I wishâ¦

296
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,419
I can remember everything soon as well.

297
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,351
I suddenly remembered.

298
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,015
This man

299
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,269
cried a lot.

300
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,671
A man who believes in soulmates

301
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,007
and a woman who thinks
there's no such thing met.

302
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,704
There was a time when there were
only two of us in the world,

303
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,541
and we were everything to each other.

304
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,772
I asked you to send me the address.
You didn't have to come.

305
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,019
Aren't you pampering him
for being the youngest?

306
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,769
I'm not.

307
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,234
Goodness.

308
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,153
How can he survive
in the real world like this?

309
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,284
He knocks down before his boss?

310
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,111
Do I look fine to you?

311
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,196
Where's Seo-young?

312
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,320
I sent her back.

313
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,621
He seems to have a secret,

314
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,788
but he won't tell me.

315
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,702
Our youngest?

316
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,172
He never keeps secrets, worries,

317
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,630
and emotions bottled up.

318
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,418
This is what's annoying about families.

319
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,340
He has a secret.

320
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,184
Talk to him gently and listen to him.

321
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,050
It seems quite serious to him.

322
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,978
Were you with Mr. Playboy?

323
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,935
So you're not going
to dump your trash on me anymore?

324
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,315
I hate that expression.

325
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,282
Let's call it a private safe instead.

326
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,412
Safe or trash can,

327
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,123
you look tired already.

328
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,866
It's because I'm embarrassed.

329
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,785
What on earth are you thinking?

330
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,131
That's embarrassing.

331
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,548
"What are you thinking?" actually means

332
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,054
"You are putting on a show
when you were acting cool."

333
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,097
"Do you think I would've brought you here

334
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,140
if my nine-year girlfriend may show up?"

335
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,138
Yes.

336
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,311
I was really embarrassed.

337
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,780
I saw the photo
of that nine-year girlfriend.

338
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,028
He's a true Mr. Playboy.

339
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,572
He actually left that out?

340
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,565
Yes.

341
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,696
I acted like I didn't see it.

342
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,162
Well done.

343
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,542
At least you didn't compliment her looks.

344
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,617
Hey.

345
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,785
If you decided to date him,
then just focus on that.

346
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,245
Why are you bringing in a woman
who's not even there

347
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,746
as if there are three of you?

348
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,337
It's all because of the photos.

349
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,804
Photos?

350
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,012
Ji-woo sent me the photos you took of me.

351
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,801
Why do you have them?

352
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,891
Did Jong-pal give them to you?

353
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,392
Hey!

354
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,102
Goodness me.

355
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,225
-Ji-woo, wake up.
-Goodness, Ji-woo.

356
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,485
This punk has no worries.

357
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,527
Hey, Ji-woo.

358
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,493
Ji-woo!

359
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,985
Is something troubling you?

360
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,245
He has absolutely no worries.

361
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,593
-Eun-hee.
-You scared me!

362
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,048
I'm going to kill you!

363
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,384
Let's go to Eun-joo's house!

364
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,965
Let us three siblings have a meeting.

365
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,429
Shut up and sleep!

366
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,142
If we go to her house now,
she'll nag us like crazy.

367
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,017
Eun-joo.

368
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,560
How can he be such a lightweight?
Is he adopted or something?

369
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,359
Eun-hee.

370
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,769
What?

371
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,110
I liked you more.

372
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,655
What?

373
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,830
I liked everything about you
and thought you were more comfortable.

374
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,541
"Liked?"

375
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,792
Why is it past tense?

376
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,713
How can love change?

377
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,462
I hate that.

378
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:37,006
I hate that so much!

379
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,510
Are you saying that to me?

380
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,388
It's crappy.

381
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,544
We threw away all of the luggage.
Is there anything you can use to pack?

382
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,035
I still have a few days left.
What's with the rush?

383
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,669
I won't take many things.

384
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,753
Okay, you can take care of it then.

385
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,207
About your father.

386
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,551
Did you tell Eun-hee?

387
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,761
I'll take care of that myself.

388
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,451
It seems like your father
attempted suicide.

389
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,659
Your mother knows, too.

390
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,166
MOM

391
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,141
Goodness. Why did he drink so much?

392
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,530
OCTOBER 13, 1983

393
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,994
Hey, Youngest.

394
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,292
Now that I think about it,

395
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,539
I think this is the first time
they went somewhere

396
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,455
on their own.

397
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,882
Ms. Sookâ¦

398
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,878
must feel weird.

399
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,187
Okay, back up.

400
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,397
A little further.

401
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,526
Little more.

402
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,412
Back up.

403
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,252
Donât do things like this.

404
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,085
Let's be mature and not be obvious.

405
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,549
Okay.

406
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,176
I want each team
to take care of everything I said.

407
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,562
I have a good feeling about this.

408
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,903
Dismissed.

409
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,268
-Well done.
-Well done.

410
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,324
So mature.

411
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,874
Excuse me.

412
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,829
How can I help you?

413
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,709
-What business do youâ¦
-I'm here to see Ms. Kim Eun-hee.

414
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,134
Ms. Kim.

415
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,014
Okay, then.

416
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,888
Tae-hyung.

417
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,562
We need to talk.

418
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,645
-Go ahead and eat.
-Okay.

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,910
Is something going on?

420
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,029
I just stopped by
because I thought of you.

421
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,406
What a clichÃ© answer.

422
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,455
This is not a place
where you just stop by.

423
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,037
What about the clinic?

424
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,962
I'm going to a seminar in New Zealand.

425
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,505
So I only worked during the morning today.

426
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,125
I see.

427
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,927
Your sister will be alone.

428
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,179
So I wanted to ask you
to go see her often.

429
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,516
Since when did you become so romantic?

430
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,444
I want you sisters to get closer.

431
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:08,987
Goodness.

432
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,950
It's awkward just to imagine
being close to her.

433
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,620
I know your sister is the problem.

434
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,754
You have a better personality
and you're more generous.

435
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,422
She's not the problem.

436
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,959
I'm not the problem either.

437
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,838
She and I are justâ¦

438
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,921
ordinary sisters.

439
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,389
I don't think
you two are ordinary sisters.

440
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,809
Sisters who love and miss
each other are the weird ones.

441
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,894
If something happens to her,

442
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,730
I'll be on her side no matter what,

443
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,484
so don't worry.

444
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,482
Butâ¦

445
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,069
you didn't come here
just to tell me that, did you?

446
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,286
There's something big, isn't there?

447
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,709
I don't think your sister will tell you.

448
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,795
But I think you should know, too.

449
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,679
It seems like your father
attempted suicide.

450
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,023
DAD

451
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,099
That's not true. Right, Dad?

452
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,444
That makes no sense.

453
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,965
Hello. I'm Ji Yong-geun, the CEO.

454
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,299
Our companyâ¦

455
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,814
only uses domestic
agricultural products as ingredients,

456
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,310
therefore is loved by the consumers.

457
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,984
Especially domestic agriculturalâ¦

458
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,074
Excuse me.

459
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,490
What are you doing?

460
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,528
Let's move to a different place.

461
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,822
Get up.

462
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,124
I'm sorry.

463
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,704
You could've just tapped me.

464
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,288
You would've gotten startled
if I tapped you.

465
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,674
I think the shop will be great.

466
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,251
Okay, let me just take a look.

467
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,430
You told him about me, right?

468
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,930
He's sharp-witted.

469
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,676
Nonsense.

470
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,271
Guys his age
are either idiots or just dogs.

471
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,732
It's either one of those two.

472
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,272
Check it yourself.
Stop bothering me during work.

473
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,276
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

474
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,954
Is he just an idiot?

475
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,482
THE YOO'S FRUIT SHOP

476
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,826
What do you need?

477
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,417
EFFECTS OF BANANAS
PREVENTS CHRONIC DEPRESSION

478
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,381
Do bananas prevent chronic depression?

479
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,672
I didn't know either, but I guess so.

480
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,386
Where's Mr. Yoo?

481
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,772
My dad?

482
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,178
He went on a date.

483
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,656
Do you like Korean melons?

484
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,487
What?

485
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,696
How disappointing.

486
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,334
Wash your hands and come out.

487
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,252
FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

488
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,099
FAMILY WELFARE

489
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,305

Dad.

496
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,102
What is it?

497
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,810
You know how to peel fruit?

498
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,441
Are you saying I never did this?

499
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,938
Wellâ¦

500
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,902
Where did Mom go?

501
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,606
She went out right after dinner
to go to the community center.

502
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,488
She said she'll be a bit late.

503
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,789
I see.

504
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,451
Ms. Sook

505
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,786
is learning poetry.

506
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,918
That itself is a poem.

507
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,709
What?

508
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,264
"Ms. Sook is learning poetry."

509
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,429
That's a poem.

510
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,761
How cool.

511
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,176
It does sound like a poem.

512
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,935
Wellâ¦

513
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,940
Eun-hee.

514
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,824
Did weâ¦

515
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,899
get along?

516
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,198
Was Iâ¦

517
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,164
a decent father?

518
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,000
It seems like your mother is angry at me.

519
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,169
Is there anything you want to tell me?

520
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:50,892
Dad.

521
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,352
Yes?

522
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,521
I wasâ¦

523
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,269
always curious about something.

524
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,525
Two, two, nine.

525
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,910
Dad, I know all the songs
from the Campus Song Festival

526
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,791
that you always asked me to record.

527
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,459
I was always curious about your singing
skills when I recorded those songs.

528
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,127
Mr. Kim Sang-sik sings "I."

529
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,515
{\an8}I have a happy dream of love

530
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,728
{\an8}So snow falls on plenty of love

531
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,521
And if our love has a song

532
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,646
We will find a beautiful life

533
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,865
It was us

534
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,001
It has been living

535
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,708
In our dreams

536
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:04,708
{\an8}With the biggest heart

537
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:12,047
I love this entire world

538
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:13,967
It seems likeâ¦

539
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,812
your father attempted suicide.

540
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,021
Following the falling leaves

541
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:26,782
He left

542
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,163
"My Love."

543
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,488
What?

544
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,866
By Youshimcho.

545
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,658
I want to sing "My Love."

546
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,421
"MY LOVE" BY YOUSHIMCHO

547
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,550
Oh

548
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:52,929
Love is a flame that has burnt

549
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,180
-Oh
-Oh

550
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:03,234
-Love is like the wind
-Love is like the wind

551
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,692
-Oh
-Oh

552
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:13,775
-Even though I try to forget her entirely
-Even though I try to forget her entirely

553
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:20,754
-But why can't I forget Jin-sook?
-But why can't I forget you?

554
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,827
Oh, my Jin-sook

555
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,344
Dad.

556
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,092
Do you remember the movie
Back To The Future?

557
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,636
What?

558
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,313
I guess the current you
wouldn't have seen it.

559
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,600
It's a movie where the main character
goes to the past and the future.

560
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,646
If the main character goes
to the past and changes something

561
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,320
and returns to the future,

562
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,611
the future is changed
in a complicated way.

563
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,780
I guessâ¦

564
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,743
that's how you feel right now, right?

565
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,907
From the eyes of a 22-year-old you,

566
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,167
the 60-year-old Ms. Lee Jin-sook

567
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,879
may seem angry and cold.

568
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,211
Butâ¦

569
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:15,513
if you accept the things
that she does and understand her,

570
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,799
then would the future change?

571
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,020
What am I saying?

572
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,731
Ms. Sook didn't do anything wrong.

573
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,353
I'm sure itâs all my fault.

574
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,318
I have to gain my memory back quickly.

575
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,454
Dad.

576
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,235
I hated you a bit.

577
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,462
You didn't talk much when you came home
and you only loved Eun-joo.

578
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,535
I was always on Mom's side.

579
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,967
I'm sorry.

580
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,846
It's good that you're
on your mother's side.

581
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,848
I'm sorry, too.

582
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,943
Butâ¦

583
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,767
Dad, promise me one thing.

584
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,186
What?

585
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,573
When your memories
come back, tell me first.

586
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,494
Why?

587
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,618
So we can find a way to surprise
our precious Ms. Jin-sook

588
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,076
How?

589
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,957
I'll tell you later.

590
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,054
Promise me.

591
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,798
When your memories come back,
you will come to me first.

592
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,548
Okay.

593
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,271
-Thank you, Dad.
-Yes.

594
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,305
Thank you.

595
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,226
Thank you for being alive, Dad.

596
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,450
-I'm sure he'll come.
-What?

597
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,704
Ms. Sook.

598
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,285
Ms. Sook.

599
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,330
Why are you here?

600
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,049
You scared me.

601
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,256
Eun-hee bought Korean melons.
Would you like me to cut them for you?

602
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,430
It's bedtime. No, thanks.

603
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,137
You don't want any?

604
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,771
By the way, I'm not a kid.

605
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,904
Were you looking for me
because you were worried about me?

606
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,741
You don't need to worry about anything.

607
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,701
I'm going to start working, too.

608
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,239
I must make money.

609
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,406
First, I'm going to go to

610
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,213
Ulsan soon.

611
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,669
They were selling it down there.

612
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,711
Isn't it lovely?

613
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,499
It was cheap too.

614
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,916
You said you'd never come to my house.

615
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:44,256
Did I promise that? No way.

616
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,223
You vacuumed the house at this hour?

617
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,303
That's good.

618
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,014
Forget the wine.

619
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,176
Beer is the best after cleaning.

620
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,361
Yes, let's go out and have a beer.

621
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,953
I ordered delivery on my way.

622
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:03,858
Beer, too.

623
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,742
Why did you ring the doorbell?
You know the passcode.

624
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,291
You even left the photo on the shelf.

625
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,620
My hands were full
because of the flower pot.

626
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,589
I've been so stressed until now.

627
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,013
I'm staying for the weekend.

628
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,266
The phone is turned off.

629
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,315
Please record a message.

630
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,610
Once you're connectedâ¦

631
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,338
The phone is turned off.

632
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,077
-Delivery.
-Thank you.

633
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,776
Is it good?

634
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,492
Not really.

635
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,660
I gifted that book to Eun-joo.

636
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,659
Eun-joo lent it to you, right?

637
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,621
Yes.

638
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,616
What about the receipt?

639
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,121
No, thanks.

640
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,390
You're a good driver.

641
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,482
I'm bad at being bad.

642
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,855
I was just kidding.

643
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,574
Get used to driving this car.

644
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,276
I don't drive that much.

645
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,835
This house is bigger than we thought.

646
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,259
I think it's actually small.

647
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,048
-Come on.
-Children.

648
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,472
Don't run. Goodness.

649
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,087
Let's go outside.

650
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,586
Thanks for showing it to us.

651
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,598
We'll call you, ma'am.

652
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,100
Put your shoes on.

653
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,977
Our house is up for sale?

654
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,439
Yes, let's talk
when your memories come back.

655
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560
But I like this house.

656
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,225
Hey.

657
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,451
Did Tae-hyung leave safely?

658
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:33,859
Yes.

659
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,324
You're here.

660
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,776
Dad, how are you?

661
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,618
I'm good.

662
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,163
But my memories aren't back yet.

663
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,076
I heard you drove the truck.

664
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,754
I could do it with my eyes closed.

665
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,381
Mom and I will be back
after grocery shopping.

666
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,336
Let's eat what we have.

667
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,594
Should I go too?

668
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,684
You shouldn't carry heavy things.

669
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,684
I have something to say.

670
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,352
You stay home.

671
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,531
What is it?

672
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:17,992
Mom.

673
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,334
Remember when you ran away with me

674
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,866
when I was in elementary school?

675
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,799
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

676
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,683
Why did you only take me?

677
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,773
Why did you leave Eun-hee behind

678
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,691
and only take me?

679
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:53,991
Mom.

680
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,737
I remember everything.

681
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,834
I was starving because I didn't
eat anything all day,

682
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,040
but I didn't tell you.

683
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,544
Because would've told me
to drink the juice

684
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,665
if I told you I was hungry.

685
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,707
I saw you putting a drug
into the juice bottle.

686
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,926
No.

687
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,467
It's not what you think.

688
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,017
Mom.

689
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,904
You tried to commit suicide with me.

690
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,947
I've committed such a big sin.

691
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,742
It's my fault.

692
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,621
We went back homeâ¦

693
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:52,955
and Dad was cooking
in the kitchen to feed Eun-hee.

694
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,924
When you were trying to kill me,

695
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,007
Dad stayed home from work
and was cooking for Eun-hee,

696
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,680
I can never forget that.

697
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,719
It wasn't a drug.

698
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,231
It was a herbal powder.

699
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,600
A poisonous one.

700
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,534
I was trying to abort Ji-woo.

701
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,043
I wasn't trying to kill you.

702
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,574
I've committed such a big sin.

703
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,905
What would've happened
if I didn't give birth to him?

704
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,794
Arenât you going to see Young-sik?

705
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,495
Dad!

706
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,132
Dad.

707
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,184
Have a safe trip back.

708
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,519
YOUNG-SIK

709
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,446
Hello?

710
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,873
I amâ¦

711
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,214
You know?

712
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,959
Right. It shows on the phone.

713
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,961
I'm calling you
after thinking for a few days.

714
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,586
Do you want to meet?

715
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,345
Why did you do that?

716
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,438
Two is fine,

717
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,767
but if it was three,

718
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,356
I thought I wouldn't
be able to do anything.

719
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,279
What's so bad about having three kids?

720
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,374
What are you, a fairy?

721
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,410
I am a fairy.

722
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,084
Then is Dad the woodcutter?

723
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,796
By the way, did you come here
to talk about this?

724
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,625
Tae-hyung told me.

725
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,969
About what?

726
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,434
About Dad.

727
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,483
About the medicine bottle

728
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,559
when he was found.

729
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,516
He didn't take it.

730
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,936
Regardless, he did
carry the medicine with him.

731
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,276
Are you

732
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,414
saying it's my fault?

733
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,503
That's not what I'm saying.

734
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,746
What are you going to do
when Dad's memories come back?

735
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,172
Isn't it obvious?

736
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,804
We just live our lives as we planned.

737
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,060
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

738
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,772
Okay.

739
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,682
Chan-hyuk.

740
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,055
Eun-hee said your phone is off.

741
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,478
I turned it off before the shoot.

742
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,442
You asked her
about registering a trademark?

743
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,396
She scheduled a dinner with Eun-joo.

744
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,570
It'll be perfect if you go now.

745
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,615
Why did she do that without talking to me?

746
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,408
I smell like cheonggukjang.

747
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,164
Eun-joo said today
was the best day for her.

748
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,076
Gosh.

749
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,416
{\an8}MARCH 2016

750
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,360
How's Jong-min?

751
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,241
Relax and tell me the truth.

752
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,871
We fought as well and he moved out.

753
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,544
He'll take his things soon.

754
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,787
That's good.

755
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,132
That means you're home alone now.

756
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,667
Yes.

757
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,886
I have a favor to ask you.

758
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:54,968
Go ahead.

759
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,806
Eun-hee is going to end it just like this.

760
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,732
She won't even consider
having a proper closure.

761
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,561
And she won't even think about
getting rid of his traces.

762
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,529
I want you to clean things
for her instead.

763
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,451
Get rid of all items related
to Eun-hee in Jong-min's room.

764
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,662
Like photos

765
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,452
or anything Eun-hee left there.

766
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,004
I heard they share a bank account.

767
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,420
Tell him to split it equally

768
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,669
and get rid of traces of Eun-hee
as much as possible.

769
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,298
Okay.

770
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,759
I'll take care of everything.

771
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,880
You're being too polite.

772
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,143
Right.

773
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,394
Thank you for taking my wedding photos.

774
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,186
But you took too many.

775
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,729
I'm not good at keeping them,

776
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,362
so I should've told you
not to take too many.

777
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,065
It seemed like you took a lot on purpose.

778
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,744
No.

779
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,531
It's normal to take that many.

780
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,493
You two met before without telling me?

781
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:03,037
It was that time
when we fought and cut ties.

782
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,832
How could I call you
when we cut ties to tell you

783
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,127
"I met your sister today."

784
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,040
Right.

785
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,883
That's when I was antisocial.

786
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,974
That's why I had your photos
that were given to Jong-min.

787
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,050
Thanks for not throwing it away.

788
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,175
I didn't even think
about throwing it away.

789
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,763
It was indifference.

790
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,347
I didn't even know that I had it.

791
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,351
She told us to come in front of her house,
but why isn't she here?

792
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,190
It's the weekend.
Are you not meeting Mr. Playboy?

793
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,237
He's out of reach.
What do you think that means?

794
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,988
He's probably slowly drifting apart.

795
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,196
So I'm staying quiet and not calling him.

796
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,080
He'll feel empty, right?

797
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,409
You wish.
He's probably enjoying his freedom.

798
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,424
Because his hidden woman
number 2 is cool and generous,

799
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,328
he must be thinking it's perfect.

800
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,707
Hidden woman number 2?

801
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,883
He may have hidden women
number 3 and 4 too.

802
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,512
No matter how harsh your criticism is,

803
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,760
I'll take everything as advice.

804
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,012
Don't leave any traces behind.

805
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,465
Trace?

806
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,770
Have you seen Mr. Playboy's trace?

807
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,769
Have you seen his footprints?

808
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,771
Don't introduce him to friends or family.
Don't show any signs.

809
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,274
Playboys hate that.

810
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,685
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

811
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,744
In order to leave no trace,

812
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,448
go to his house
and don't bring him to your house.

813
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,696
I'll stop here.

814
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,327
That was too nosy.

815
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,459
I didnât know.

816
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,094
We don't go to the movies,
famous restaurants,

817
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,511
or nice cafes.

818
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,419
We always go to his house.

819
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:40,177
I thought we were just lazy
because we're old,

820
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,891
but we were actually
trying not to leave any trace.

821
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,845
Now I understand
after hearing it from you.

822
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,520
He's a real pro.

823
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,985
-Here are your two cups of coffee.
-Thanks.

824
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,992
-Hello.
-You should've waited.

825
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,448
I was going to pay.

826
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,827
Buy us dinner then.

827
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,577
I'd like coffee too.

828
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,001
Let's have a drink today.

829
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,088
I'm free today.

830
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,382
I see.

831
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,804
Take those first. I'll bring mine.

832
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,724
Okay.

833
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,143
Did she talk casually to him?

834
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,153
I think so.

835
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,690
She didn't even talk casually
to Ji-woo's friends.

836
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,899
-You don't have to drink it.
-Why not?

837
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,244
You said you're going to drink.

838
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,082
Alcohol and coffee are different.

839
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,406
Hey, why are they whispering?

840
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,081
Are you free today?

841
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,166
I'm free for a while.

842
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,415
Hey, did you see the way she moved?

843
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,718
Just drink coffee.

844
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,045
Why? Where's Dr. Yoon?

845
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,308
He went to a seminar.

846
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,389
I see. A seminar.

847
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,434
To where?

848
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,097
New Zealand.

849
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,025
I'll bring it.

850
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,405
You will?

851
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,661
Thanks.

852
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,470
When the bloodâ¦

853
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,804
rushes to the brain all of a sudden,

854
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,724
it's good for your brain.

855
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,814
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

856
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,898
Ms. Sook, do you want to do that together?

857
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,737
Ms. Sook.

858
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,036
I thought about it.

859
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:15,462
About why I didn't tell you
I was born in Ulsan until now.

860
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,881
Was it because I was worried
that you might think of me as a liar

861
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,842
or because I was embarrassed
about lying about that to you?

862
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,805
If I saw the future
when I was 22 years old,

863
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,648
if I knew that we would have three kids

864
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:41,149
and live happily for a long time,

865
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,952
I would've told you everything,

866
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,533
embarrassing or not.

867
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,871
Did you think I would leave?

868
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,424
I'm not good enough for you.

869
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,339
I was going to go there alone

870
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,220
but come to Ulsan with me tomorrow.

871
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:09,049
It seems like you're bothered
so let's go meet him.

872
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,176
I'm not keeping any more secrets from you.

873
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,270
Let's talk when your memories come back.

874
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,483
Come with me.

875
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,435
I don't know the way either,

876
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,565
so you should be by my side.

877
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,952
Okay?

878
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:31,952
There's still no beer in this place
and you're still close to that barista.

879
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,538
Because Tae-hyung and I are regulars here.

880
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,621
We do trademark registrations,
but we don't do business registrations.

881
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,128
I have something to look into
regarding trademark registration.

882
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,341
Then I'll do it for you
instead of connecting you to someone else.

883
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,263
I started working again, anyway.

884
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,801
You started working?

885
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,505
Did you get reinstated to your old work?

886
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,755
I'll send you
the list of documents you need.

887
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,136
I'm a freelancer.

888
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,347
Alsoâ¦

889
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:57,848
Here.

890
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,016
You prepared them already?

891
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,154
No, I was organizing some photos recently

892
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,653
and found some photos of you and Eun-hee.

893
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,740
I developed some of your
wedding photos in black-and-white.

894
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,118
It's nice.

895
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,794
You're a good photographer.

896
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,041
This is so sudden.

897
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,547
Are you organizing
your photo albums these days?

898
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:29,723
I wanted to give them to you
as a wedding gift but had no chance.

899
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,300
So I'm giving them to you now.

900
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,545
I thought you might be glad to see them.

901
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,354
You're talking so politely.

902
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,949
I can see the emotions show better
since the photos are black-and-white.

903
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,384
I have a 50% off coupon for chicken.

904
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,431
Will you eat it if I order it?

905
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,891
-I have one too.
-One chicken per person?

906
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,722
-No, use mine.
-I asked to eat first, so use mine.

907
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,728
-Cola or lemon-lime soda?
-Lemon-lime soda.

908
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,730
Fried or baked?

909
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,401
Fried.

910
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,819
-Radish or pickle as a side?
-Radish.

911
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,864
Cola, baked, and pickle?

912
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,736
None of them fit my taste.

913
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,283
Why did you even ask then?

914
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,373
I thought you'd just let me pick.

915
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:38,952
Gosh.

916
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,576
Though it doesn't
fit your taste, enjoy the food.

917
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,883
This is what sudden use
of honorifics feels like.

918
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,050
When the time comes and the vibe is right,
do something with me.

919
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,722
I knew there was something.

920
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:54,761
What is it?

921
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,854
Isn't it obvious
between a young man and a woman?

922
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,719
Have a fling and date?

923
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,308
I have a girlfriend.

924
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,271
You acted like you didn't.

925
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,732
I never did that.

926
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,742
You never said
you're going on a date or anything.

927
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,820
Right.

928
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,992
She lives far away. Really far away.

929
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,996
Why does the food keep coming?

930
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,130
You should eat well when you drink.

931
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,631
You're old.

932
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,755
Eun-joo.

933
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,683
The one who said
you're perfect and wonderful

934
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,644
is this guy.

935
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,853
It was Chan-hyuk.

936
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,442
He said you're perfect and wonderful.

937
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,016
You're insightful.

938
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,194
-Yes.
-Order some more.

939
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,614
I just remembered.

940
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,283
Jong-pal told me before.

941
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,781
He said you liked my sister.

942
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,203
You said she was
perfect and wonderful. Right?

943
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,155
Are you drunk?

944
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,582
It's because she lacks insight.

945
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,501
What about me?

946
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,131
Be honest.

947
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,499
You liked my sister, right?

948
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,550
Hey, just eat your food.

949
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,345
Eun-joo, when were you
planning to tell me about Dad?

950
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,770
How did you know?

951
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,101
That's not important.

952
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,266
Were you trying to
keep it to yourself again?

953
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,269
What are you? A problem solver?

954
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,487
Never mind.

955
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,777
Nothing was solved anyway.

956
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,204
I hate it when you talk
about serious things when you're drunk.

957
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,578
I'm not drunk.

958
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,703
I'm not!

959
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,255
Mr. Yoo, who studies
fruits and vegetables, please come out.

960
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,219
You know nothing.

961
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,590
Eun-joo.

962
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,433
I feel sick.

963
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,472
Why did my Dadâ¦

964
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,936
do such a thing?

965
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,476
This is so embarrassing.

966
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,798
Don't sneak out. Let's finish talking.

967
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,850
What now?

968
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,397
Why is she not letting me go?
What will she nag about this time?

969
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:38,782
Darn it.

970
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,753
How come there's no outlet
in such a big house?

971
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,634
CLOSET: PETER YOON'S CHATROOM

972
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,990
What are you doing in there?

973
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,909
Charging.

974
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,535
Charging my phone.

975
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,869
Tae-hyung left his laptop.

976
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,673
Does he not need it?

977
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,129
What's with your face?

978
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,351
Oh.

979
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,096
Hangover.

980
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:29,108
Eun-joo.

981
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,275
Don't look.

982
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,124
CLOSET: PETER YOON'S CHATROOM

983
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,699
DIANA: COMING OUT IS GIVING UP

984
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,874
HER 23: A FEMALE EMPLOYEE SAID I LOOK GAY

985
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:18,913
DIANA: SHE'S GOT KEEN EYES

986
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,036
HER 23: WHY DO I FEEL BAD
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS I'M GAY?

987
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,174
ATO: PETER YOON, DID YOU REALLY
COME OUT TO YOUR WIFE?

988
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,631
DIANA: DID YOU GO
TO THE SEMINAR OR RUN AWAY?!

989
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,213
PETER YOON

990
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,054
We're family.

991
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,217
We are familyâ¦

992
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,522
but we don't know much

993
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:43,694
about each other.

994
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,885
You've been ignoring me for years

995
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,428
and now you're worried about me?

996
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:23,595
My eldest sister has no father.

997
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,980
I hope he's not getting weird ideas.

998
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,654
It's my house
and it's the matter of my family. Go.

999
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,993
He remembers things so clearly, butâ¦

1000
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,199
You wrote "I love you" on the note.

1001
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,780
But sometimes he says
something totally different.

1002
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,275
I remember everything now.

1003
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,787
Tell me.

1004
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,118
Why did you act that way on that day?

1005
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,674
