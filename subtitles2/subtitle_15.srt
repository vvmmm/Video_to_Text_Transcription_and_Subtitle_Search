There's water in River Domor.

You were the one who taught me
how to sing.

If you would have told me
on the very first day...

that I'll drown in darkness
because of music.

I'd never have taken up music.

Other people's music is so soulful.

Why, Master?

Can you hear them?

The Domors have risen.

51
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,960
The age of the Rudrabhairavs is over.

And the days of the Naads are also over.

You made me a Naad.

I'll come back to you.

Believe me, Bahadur.

83
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,040
It's true that I came here to kill
Abdul's descendants.

84
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,640
And I know that you and Mumtaz
are his descendants.

85
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,960
But I couldn't kill Mumtaz.

86
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm in love with her.
Trust me, Bahadur.

- I don't believe you, rascal.
- You have to.

I would have killed you and Mumtaz by now
if I wanted to.

Bahadur, after coming to Anandagarh
I've realised that hatred...

can destroy everything
in an instant.

But love gives the power
to protect.

I want to live like others.

You have to find a corpse, Bahadur.

- Corpse?
- Yes.

99
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,320
He was Abdul's only son.

100
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
He was hiding.

101
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,720
I've learnt that Abdul does not have
anymore children.

102
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,640
Madanti's lineage ends with him.

103
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Please release me now.

104

Where do you think you're going?

105

He did not want his granddaughter

Gopal followed Rudrabhairav's orders

Everyone's DNA matched

Everyone's except Mom's.

He said he'll be late.

162
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,440
There's a flood in some village.

Come, sweetie.

167
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,920
Remember, the Ramayana?
Even a dacoit can turn into a sage.

168
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,840
And if someone from Rudrapur
gets to know our identity?

169
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
What if he changes his mind in future?

170
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,440
I'm not telling it for myself, Grandpa.

171
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,040
They'll not spare even my daughter.

172
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Hmm.

173
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,920
It's quite possible.

174
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,440
There's only one way out.

175
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Bahadur...

176
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,000
you have to do something.

177
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,040
When he brings the children
he had rescued...

178
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,520
exchange this baby
with one of them.

179
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,640
But this must remain
within the three of us.

180
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
You stole my dad.

181
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,360
Your dad will be your's forever.

182
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,440
I give you my word.

183
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,440
I'll always keep it a secret.

184
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
Everyone promise me...

185
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,520
that you'll keep it a secret.

186
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
Promise me!

187
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,120
What about Raga Sanjivani?

188
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Calm down.

189
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,280
Raga Sanjivani.

190
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
That...

191
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
That will remain a secret too.

192
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,960
It will remain a secret.

193
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
Master told me...

194
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,120
that the raga can bring
the dead back to life.

195
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
But it can kill many others.

196
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,240
So, Tansen kept it a secret.

197
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,920
We'll keep it a secret too.

198
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,960
Go, let it drown.

198
00:21:22,305 --> 00:22:22,309
