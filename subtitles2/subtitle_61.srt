162
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,301
Hey, it's Pete Cozy.

163
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,768
Yeah, no... -

164
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,105
Okay, um...

165
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,219
Do you know of anyone else
that might be hiring?

166
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,091
[Sighs]

167
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,956
- [Mouthing words]

168
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,624
- Can I help you?

169
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,191
- Hi, Pete, right?

170
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,830
I was just checking out
your playlists.

171
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,669
I approve.
- Thank you.

172
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,800
- I was just curious 'cause
all the jobs on your rÃ©sumÃ©

173
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,275
were in the music industry.

174
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,743
It's not every day
someone transfers

175
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,007
to the supermarket business.

176
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,378
How'd you end up here?

177
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,440
- I don't know.

178
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,452
- [Laughs]

179
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,249
Is there anything fun
to do around here?

180
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:28,550
See any good shows?

181
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,079
- I don't really get out much.

182
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:31,250
I have a kid.
- Aww.

183
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,520
Boy or girl?

184
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,721
- A boy.

185
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,229
His name's Henry.
He's three.

186
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,425
- That's so cute.

187
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,169
I'd like to talk to you
outside of the office

188
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,866
for a few minutes,
a more casual atmosphere.

189
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:50,606
But if you have to go home,
I totally understand.

190
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,078
- I don't mind
that she's coming over.

191
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:54,240
I just wish you would have
given me some time to prepare.

192
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,045
- She's just coming over
for a drink.

193
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,482
She's not expecting
anything.

194
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,745
- The place is a mess.

195
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,275
- Seemed like
the easiest thing to do.

196
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,118
[Knocking at door]

197
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:04,180
Hey, come on in.

198
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:05,521
- I was so lost.

199
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,220
I didn't realize
you had it so rough.

200
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,251
- Oh, no,
it's not a bad neighborhood.

201
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,194
- Oh, okay.

202
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:12,430
I needed to get out of L.A.

203
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,798
I was in a lousy relationship.

204
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,894
It wasn't working out
at Slater's.

205
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:19,565
ACS made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

206
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,903
They said
if I took over here,

207
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,466
I could do anything
I wanted.

208
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,308
We are going to transform
this company.

209
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:27,813
- Wow.

210
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:30,282
You know, I don't even know
what Pete does, actually.

211
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,182
- 'Cause it sounds so boring
when I talk about it.

212
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,447
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,455
- I love talking shop.

214
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,616
Our department takes data

215
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,284
that represents
customers' behavior,

216
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,623
like what customers
are buying.

217
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,128
It then translates that data
into strategies

218
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,631
that can be used in stores
to increase sales.

219
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,098
- Oh, you mean
like putting soda cans

220
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,327
at the ends of the aisle.

221
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:51,303
- Yeah, that kind of thing,
but so much more.

222
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:52,999
Look, you guys
drink organic milk, right?

223
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,028
- Yeah.

224
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,406
- Right, one child,
suburban,

225
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,411
I know how much you make.

226
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:00,208
You're an easy demographic.

227
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:04,149
I bet I could guess
75% of what's in your fridge.

228
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,880
I mean, the stuff you buy
doesn't happen by accident.

229
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,548
What do you do, Sara?

230
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,150
- I'm not actually working
right now.

231
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,058
You know, raising Henry
is a full-time job.

232
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,687
- She's going back to work soon.

233
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,789
- Yeah, maybe.

234
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,628
- Oh, what is that?

235
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,898
- We're having a Halloween party
at the office.

236
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:24,995
Spouses are invited.

237
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,403
- On Halloween?

238
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,929
- Yeah, when else?

239
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,066
- Oh, you know what?

240
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,201
That's Henry's party.

241
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,801
They're having
a little Halloween party

242
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:32,971
at his school, so...

243
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,311
- It's earlier,
so we could go to both.

244
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,714
- Can I come?

245
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:38,740
- To Henry's party?

246
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,754
- Yeah,
unless it's not cool.

247
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,777
- [Laughs]

248
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:44,687
No.
I guess it would be okay.

249
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:45,691
- Good night.

250
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:46,692
- No.

251
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,354
- [Sighs]

252
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,694
I better go too.

253
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:54,199
Here's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

254
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,464
A lot of bosses coming into
a department like this

255
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,528
would lay off
a lot of people.

256
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,164
I don't have time
to go out and rehire.

257
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,470
We're just going to have to work
with what we have.

258
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,945
But I do have to fire someone,
just to trim costs.

259
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,003
- Mm.

260
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,241
- It's not you, obviously.

261
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,078
But I thought you might know
who it should be.

262
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,744
Who is the worst performer
in the office?

263
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,754
Who's bringing morale down?
- Can I think about it?

264
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,278
- No, I don't want you
to think about it.

265
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,416
I'm sure as soon as I said it,
a name came into your head.

266
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,619
- Matt Davis?
- Really?

267
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,718
Why him?

268
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,126
- He's always missing deadlines.

269
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:26,189
I mean,
he's kind of half-assed.

270
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:27,358
- What about Tony Gomes?

271
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,492
- Tony?

272
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:29,559
No.

273
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:30,900
I mean,
I think we should keep him.

274
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,632
He's all right.

275
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:34,003
He's a good worker.

276
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,064
- All right.

277
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,632
Thanks.

278
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,303
I'm glad I asked you that.

279
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:39,369
- Good morning.

280
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:40,538
- Good morning.
Wolski's.

281
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,911
Yes, mm-hmm, please hold.

282
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,749
- What's going on?

283
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,583
- She fired Tony.

284
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,419
- No way.

285
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:53,119
- She wants to see you too.

286
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,426
- Dude...

287
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,506
I'm sorry.

288
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,100
- I hated this place anyway.

289
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:11,110
[Knock at door]

290
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,771
- Yeah, come in.

291
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,448
Shut the door.

292
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:23,322
- I thought
you weren't gonna fire Tony.

293
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,618
- I never said that.

294
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:26,216
I just wanted your opinion.

295
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,590
- He's got four kids.

296
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,685
- I don't feel good about it.

297
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:30,025
Firing people sucks.

298
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,860
It's sweet that
you're worried about his kids,

299
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:32,956
but he was slacking.

300
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,125
He wasn't happy here.

301
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,657
Sit.

302
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,269
We've got a lot of work
to do here.

303
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:39,601
We don't have time
to fuck around,

304
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,765
feeling bad for Tony Gomes.

305
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:42,104
He'll land on his feet.

306
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,803
Sit.

307
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,945
When I was working at Slater's,
I hired a company

308
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,847
called Intellichoice
to look over our stores

309
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,181
and to suggest strategies.

310
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:54,345
These guys are cutting-edge.

311
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:55,615
- Yeah, they're consultants.

312
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,021
- Yeah, they're very good
at what they do.

313
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,685
When the preliminary results
came in,

314
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,523
I was blown away.

315
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:03,791
And my boss at Slater's,
an asshole named D'asarlo,

316
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,457
decided to can
the whole thing.

317
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:06,829
- Why?

318
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,766
- Because he's an asshole.

319
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:09,928
He didn't give me a reason.

320
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,698
He said it was his decision,

Our HMO
offers an additional 60%.

789
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,790
That leaves you
with only $10 a month to pay.

See Donna for the paperwork.

797
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:45,640
- Assface.
- No.

798
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,740
What's he thinking,
calling me Susie Q?

799
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:51,911
He didn't give your old boss
any cute nicknames, did he?

800
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:52,977
- But you guys, you... -

801
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,113
- Drop it.

802
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:08,761
- Did you go
to the volvo dealership?

803
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:12,432
- Yeah,
I went for a test-drive.

804
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:13,667
We need a new car.

805
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,697
Ours keeps breaking down.

806
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,141
And besides,
I feel like such a loser

807
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:18,077
when I drop Henry off
in my crappy car.

808
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,739
- I thought you hate
all the moms at school

809
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:21,442
with their 4x4s.

810
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:24,781
- I do,
but volvos are different.

811
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,286
- Well, it's a hefty sum.

812
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:27,754
- Yeah, but look at... -
for the lease.

813
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,188
- Well, that's what
I'm looking at.

814
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:31,658
I thought
we'd pay off our mortgage.

815
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,627
- It was just an idea.

816
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:35,629
It's so nice
not to have to worry

817
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:37,790
about money so much.

818
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,629
- We have to pay off
our credit cards.

819
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:40,793
- Uh-uh.

820
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:42,700
I refinanced them.

821
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:44,364
Because
of your new income level,

822
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,202
we qualify
for a no-fee account,

823
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,038
so I got us a new card,

824
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,738
and I transferred
all the old ones onto that one,

825
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,770
and we get 0%
for three months.

826
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,976
- I'm gonna set my alarm
for 4:30.

827
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,146
I have so much work to do,
it's not even funny.

828
00:32:00,188 --> 00:32:01,985
- So I guess

829
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,321
you don't want to get
all tired out.

830
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,691
- Mm-mm, I got to read
all this stuff.

831
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,828
- I stopped taking the pill.

832
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,233
What do you think?

833
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,898
- I think I don't have much say
in the matter.

834
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,668
- [Chuckles]

835
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,299
Don't blame me later.

836
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,969
- [Chuckles]

837
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:25,343
Mm.

838
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,343
- Mommy!

839
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:33,250
- Oh, what's wrong, buddy?

840
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,983
- This is hot.

841
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:37,184
- Do you have a fever?

842
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:38,852
- [Grunts]

843
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:39,985
- I'm sorry, buddy.

844
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:41,325
I'm gonna go get you
some Tylenol.

845
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,057
I'll be right back.

846
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,535
- Hi.
- Hi.

847
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:54,370
- Oh, are those anthuriums?

848
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,876
- Uh...

849
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,943
Yeah.

850
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:02,506
- Todd, hi.

851
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,608
Pete Cozy.

852
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,811
- Pete, face to name.

853
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,581
- Can I get you a coffee?

854
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,919
- No, I'm set, thanks.
- Great.

855
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,424
- This place is great.

856
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,393
You guy are doing a great job
keeping a low profile.

857
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:15,555
- Yeah.
Thanks.

858
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,791
- I'd like to check out
the computers before we start.

859
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,299
- Okay,
I set you up in my office.

860
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,631
Please.
- Great.

861
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:22,158
Here's a hard copy
of my itinerary.

862
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,329
It's gonna be tight,

863
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:24,861
but I've got
a 3:30 flight tomorrow

864
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:26,305
that I've got to catch.

865
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:28,741
I'm speaking at UCLA,
and then I'm off to Japan.

866
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:30,300
And if I don't fit in
some family time,

867
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:31,903
my wife will kill me,
you know what I mean?

868
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,004
- Yeah.

869
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,878
I was up all night
with a sick kid.

870
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,042
- Oh, I know what it's like.

871
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,314
Last year,
I took my kids down the Amazon.

872
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:39,820
One of 'em came back
with a tapeworm.

873
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:41,321
I didn't sleep for a week.

874
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:45,156
This is perfect.

875
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,660
I think
you're gonna be very excited

876
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:47,991
with what we've put together.

877
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,898
Slater's was trying to compete
against the superstores

878
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,457
using EDLP modeling.

879
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:55,799
And of course,
you can't compete with that.

880
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,634
It's the same with Wolski's.

881
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,640
You can't beat them on price
every time

882
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,574
or go chasing
their specials pricing.

883
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,578
Wolski's needs something new
to compete.

884
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:08,048
What we're proposing
is predictive analysis

885
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:09,811
at a level unheard of
in this industry.

886
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,546
- This is what we were pushing
at Slater's,

887
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:12,780
but they just wouldn't listen.

888
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,117
- Well, to be fair,
this industry

889
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,783
seems particularly slow
to adapt to new trends,

890
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,314
but there
are big opportunities here.

891
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,656
Susan wanted big ideas.

892
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,321
- All right,
just so I can find some way

893
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,125
to translate all of this:

894
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,462
What we're seeing is,
we're better off

895
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,468
choosing select products
for big discounts

896
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:28,901
rather than
the hybrid incentives

897
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:29,925
we're using right now.

898
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:31,700
- Correct.

899
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,333
And the key
is which products we select.

900
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,002
We're not just
selling the product.

901
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:38,342
We are selling our image.

902
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,904
Each featured product
will announce to the customer

903
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,883
who we are,
what makes us special,

904
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,910
not just the product
but the kind of products.

905
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:49,514
We're not offering
special prices.

906
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:52,252
We are offering...

907
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:55,557
specialness.

908
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,028
- What about
our other competitors?

909
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:59,032
Did you get a chance
to review their strategies?

910
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,363
- Well, as far as we can tell,

911
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,459
none of the other shops
are doing anything like this.

912
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:04,129
It's very exciting.
- [Laughs]

913
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,468
- But there's a big qualifier.

914
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:07,200
It's all comes down
to implementation.

915
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,673
If you could
put all these strategies

916
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,834
into your stores tomorrow,

917
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:11,309
we'd be two years
ahead of everybody,

918
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:13,039
but realistically,
I know how long it takes

919
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,173
to work these things
through the chain.

920
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:17,240
Once the strategies
start to go into your stores,

921
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:18,683
your competitors
are gonna notice.

922
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:21,152
- So after two years,
there's almost no advantage.

923
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:24,123
- There's a declining function.

924
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:27,058
But when these strategies
go into your stores,

925
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:29,494
your market share
will grow 8% to 10%

926
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:30,518
within three months.

927
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,623
- 8% to 10%?
- Wow.

928
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,464
- After time,
these numbers decline steeply.

929
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:38,232
Stealing ideas is what passes
for R&D in this business.

930
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:41,104
- So has ACS spoken
to the vendors about all this?

931
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,506
- Pete, shh.

932
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,531
- I'm sorry.

933
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,238
I thought ACS was behind you
on this.

934
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,911
- It's complicated.

935
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,042
- You're so happy
to go to work these days.

936
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,073
- I know.
I just... -

937
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,780
I feel better about it now,

938
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,789
like what I'm doing
might actually have some value.

939
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,791
- Pricing groceries?

940
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,293
- I joined the gym
near the office,

941
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:03,091
thought I'd start going
during lunch.

942
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,461
Got you a membership too.

943
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,522
- [Scoffs]

944
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,294
I'm getting fat, huh?

945
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,097
- No.
It was only 10 bucks.

946
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:10,933
- When am I gonna have a chance
to go to the gym?

947
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:11,995
- You just got to make time.

948
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:14,165
Susan goes
at 5:00 in the morning.

949
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,266
- Susan doesn't have kids.

950
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,936
- You're kidding me!

951
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:19,741
That Cartwright!

952
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:22,247
Jesus Christ!

953
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:24,307

00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:20,328
They aren't even
in the same part of the country.

1111
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,397
I mean, what's good for Slater's
is good for Wolski's

1112
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:23,806
is good for ACS.

1113
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,810
- These strategies
weren't any good for Slater's.

1114
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,539
- They may not have been great
for Slater's,

1115
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,807
but Wolski's is losing money,

1116
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,371
and we have to do something
about that.

1117
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,713
- I don't understand how
you could afford Intellichoice

1118
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,685
with the consulting budget
that you have.

1119
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,211
- To tell you the truth,
I had to make some cuts.

1120
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:39,952
- Yes, yes, cuts... -
Tony Gomes.

1121
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:43,120
12 years at Wolski's, and you... -
you just threw him away.

1122
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,321
- He was slacking.

1123
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:45,762
- Yeah, well,
that's funny,

1124
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,731
'cause I can't find
a single thing in the reports

1125
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:48,926
saying that he was slacking.

1126
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,332
He had seniority.

1127
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:53,964
- He was making three times
what his peers were making.

1128
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:56,566
Was he worth three times
one of them?

1129
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:57,836
No.

1130
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:01,437
Intellichoice has given us
some solid strategies

1131
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,210
that we can start putting
in our stores in January.

1132
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,477
- January?

1133
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:06,814
At the managers' convention?

1134
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:07,841
- Exactly.

1135
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,251
- In five weeks?
- Yeah.

1136
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:12,280
- How are you gonna translate
these statistical models

1137
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:15,555
into strategies
the managers will understand

1138
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:16,925
in five weeks?

1139
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,953
- Well, uh, the statistics... -

1140
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,989
- Excuse me, uh, Susan,
if I may.

1141
00:43:25,504 --> 00:43:29,964
First of all, the HP9726,
the scanning system

1142
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,771
we put in all our stores
last year,

1143
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,643
can handle this
behind the scenes.

1144
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,511
- You have to retrain
the checkout people?

1145
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:38,175
- No, no,
well, uh, the managers

1146
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:39,649
will need a little bit
of training,

1147
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,152
but that's mostly
just to understand

1148
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,278
why we're doing this.

1149
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,982
They already know
how to do these things.

1150
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,422
The rest
is just shelving strategies

1151
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,755
and scanning feedback,
really.

1152
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,351
- On steroids.

1153
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:50,986
- When are we gonna see
the results from this?

1154
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,862
- Intellichoice indicates
an 8% to 10% increase in sales

1155
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:55,093
in three months.

1156
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,431
- Three months!

1157
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,369
I mean, the only time
we see results like that

1158
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,531
is when a Walmart opens
near one of our stores,

1159
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:02,904
and then the results are bad.

1160
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,408
- I just don't see
how you can do it.

1161
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:06,741
No, personally, I mean,
that department you're running,

1162
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,075
it doesn't have the people;

1163
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,273
it doesn't have the expertise

1164
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,872
to put that kind of plan
into action.

1165
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,577
- The only thing wrong
with that department

1166
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:14,142
was the leadership
that it was getting.

1167
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:17,212
- Jim Grady
was an excellent manager,

1168
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,450
and he was a personal friend
of mine.

1169
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,585
- I've been in this business
my entire life,

1170
00:44:22,628 --> 00:44:27,656
and I've never seen a department
come together like this.

1171
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,462
They were just waiting
for something

1172
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,025
to get excited about!

1173
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:32,866
- Okay, Susan, Pete,

1174
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,269
we've heard
what you have to say,

1175
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:35,637
and we'll let you know.

1176
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:43,272
- Mr. Cozy, Mr. Bennington
would like to see you alone.

1177
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,354
- Pete Cozy,
I wanted to meet you personally

1178
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:53,824
before you
went back to New York.

1179
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,327
Now, I know you're focused
on this project right now,

1180
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,989
but when it's done,
I'd like to sit down

1181
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:01,090
and have a chat,
maybe dinner.

1182
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:05,467
Susan says that
you went to Dartmouth.

1183
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:06,630
I have a daughter at Columbia.

1184
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:07,764
- Oh.

1185
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:11,264
- Education is the most
important thing in life.

1186
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,607
You can have all the experience
in the world,

1187
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,613
but without the foundation
of an education,

1188
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,808
it just doesn't amount
to much.

1189
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:22,115
- "Genius without education
is like silver in the mine."

1190
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:23,781
- Indeed.

1191
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,153
You're a family man,
aren't you?

1192
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,282
- Yes.

1193
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:29,452
- Happiest years of my life,
raising my kids.

1194
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,792
- Great.

1195
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,956
- I've always believed that

1196
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:34,625
if you surround yourself
with the best people,

1197
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,429
they force you to play
at the top of your game.

1198
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:39,061
But Susan is a piece of work.

1199
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,038
She was driving everyone crazy
at Slater's.

1200
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,541
If I approve these strategies
of yours,

1201
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,736
I'm gonna make
some important people angry.

1202
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,669
Can your people
back in Long Island

1203
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:53,912
really get this done
in five weeks?

1204
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,476
- Susan can get anything done,
sir.

1205
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,681
- I'm asking you.

1206
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,689
- Um...

1207
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,761
I believe
we can get it done.

1208
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,365
- You're a good man, Pete,
honest.

1209
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,371
I like that.

1210
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,669
I'll stay in touch.

1211
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,538
Send Miss Felders in.

1212
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,100
- [Laughs]

1213
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,441
Classic.

1214
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:24,277
- Susan,
the board was...

1215
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,215
mostly willing
to go along.

1216
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,083
Now, you only have five weeks
to get this set up,

1217
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,250
so I guess
you better keep going.

1218
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,417
- No, I think he was talking
about giving me a job.

1219
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,653
- Higher than vice president?

1220
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:37,683
- I don't know.

1221
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,717
- President?

1222
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:39,730
- [Chuckles]

1223
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:40,788
[Knock at door]

1224
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,423
Oh, Susan's here.
I got to go.

1225
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,558
I love you.

1226
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,865
- Love you too.

1227
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,268
- Hi.

1228
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,635
I'm going out
with some friends.

1229
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:49,866
Do you want to come?

1230
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,465
What did Bennington say
to you?

1231
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,636
- Well, he said that when
we're done with this project,

1232
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,803
he wants to talk to me.

1233
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,403
- Yeah, when these strategies
come out,

1234
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,506
the headhunters
are gonna be all over you.

1235
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,846
He wants to get you
under contract

1236
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:00,976
before that happens.

1237
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,885
<i>[upbeat rock music]</i>

1238
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,890
Janis, Jake,

1239
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,858
this is Pete.

1240
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,190
- Hi, I'm Janis.

1241
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,855
- He's the only cool guy
in the office, so be nice.

1242
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:15,058
Hey, honey.
- Hey.

1243
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,727
- You should see this place
they call Long Island.

1244
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,668
It's totally nowheresville.

1245
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:20,965
It's like the valley,

1246
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,473
but the people
are pale and yucky.

1247
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,533
The only place to eat
is Friday's.

1248
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,942
The people are so unhealthy.

1249
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,240
- So what do you do?

1250
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,304
- I'm an artist.

1251
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,336
- She runs a website.

1252
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,782
- Just to pay the bills.

1253
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,410
Did you always work
in supermarkets?

1254
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,079
- Oh, no, no way.

1255
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,782
I was working for this guy
in New York,

1256
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,450
running his record label.

1257
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,722
That fell apart,
so I needed another job.

1258
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,023
- I know how it is.

1259
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,859
- But I'm not planning
on doing that forever.

1260
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,955
- Oh, yeah?

1261
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,488
What are you gonna be doing,
Pete?

1262
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,229
- Well, I'd like to try and get
back into the music business.

1263
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:56,501
- Haven't you noticed

01:02:21,968 --> 01:02:23,026
I fell asleep on my desk.

1594
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,867
- I stayed up waiting for you.

1595
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:27,430
- Come on.
I told you not to do that.

1596
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:30,307
- I was worried.

1597

- Well, why didn't you
call me then?

- I don't know.

1599
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:36,208
I didn't want to bother you.

1600
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:38,240
I know you're doing
what you have to do.

1601

I love you.

Yeah, I'll call later.

I went to your office,

Why?
Do I look bad?

1609

01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:06,477
You look great.

01:03:06,513 --> 01:03:07,980

1613
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,580
- So tell me what's gonna happen
when all this is over.

1614
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:22,195
- Bennington's gonna move me
back to L.A.

1615
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:25,665
He's gonna put me in charge
of national strategies.

1616
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:27,394
- He told you that?

1617

- No.

1618
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,563
But he knows I want the job.

1619

- Mm-hmm.

1620

- What choice does he have?

1621
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:40,639
I might take you with me.

1622
01:03:51,224 --> 01:03:52,350

1623
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:53,723
- Good morning, Doug.

1624
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,389
- Get ready for Bennington
in a couple hours.

1625

I'm very well, thanks.

I'm your guy.

1636

That's what I've been doing
for you.

01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:19,217
- Pete.
- I've been proud to do it.

1638
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:21,482
And I'm all about
making a difference

1639
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:24,513
in this company.

1640
01:04:24,558 --> 01:04:26,856
- Mr. Bennington
wants to take me, you, and Sara

1641
01:04:26,893 --> 01:04:28,656
out to dinner tonight.

1642
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:31,095
I made a reservation for 7:00.

1643
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,458
- Okay.

1644
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:35,661
I'll call Sara.

1645
01:04:35,702 --> 01:04:37,693
[Laughter]

1646
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:40,832
- No, no, I can't.
- Try it.

1647
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:42,273
Please, please try it.
It's so good.

1648
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:43,742
- I'm on a diet.
I can't.

1649
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:45,540
- You will be so sad
if you don't taste this.

1650
01:04:45,579 --> 01:04:46,568
- Oh...

1651
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:47,602
- [laughs]

1652
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:48,705
Right?

1653
01:04:48,748 --> 01:04:50,545
It's amazing.
- Yes, it is.

1654
01:04:50,584 --> 01:04:52,449
So how are we coming
with the organics, Pete?

1655
01:04:52,485 --> 01:04:53,747
- Oh, pretty well.

1656
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,345
It's just a shelving issue
at this point,

1657
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:57,379
so it's not like the managers
won't know how to do it.

1658
01:04:57,424 --> 01:04:58,516
- What's that about?

1659
01:04:58,558 --> 01:05:00,355
- Organics have
a special section in our store,

1660
01:05:00,393 --> 01:05:01,758
but Pete is telling us

1661
01:05:01,795 --> 01:05:04,025
we should put our organics
next to our regular products.

1662
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:05,622
- Well, what difference
does that make?

1663
01:05:05,665 --> 01:05:07,132
- Organics cost more,

1664
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,634
so generally,
the feeling has been

1665
01:05:08,668 --> 01:05:10,295
to keep them
in their own department.

1666
01:05:10,337 --> 01:05:13,704
You keep the price image down,
also offering some quality.

1667
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,904
- Our research shows that
organics have come a long way.

1668
01:05:17,944 --> 01:05:19,343
It's a trend change.

1669
01:05:19,379 --> 01:05:20,676
It's exactly the kind of thing

1670
01:05:20,714 --> 01:05:23,080
that ACS
is the last to figure out.

1671
01:05:23,116 --> 01:05:24,845
So it's a big deal for us.

1672
01:05:26,419 --> 01:05:28,944
- Essentially,
we make more on the organics.

1673
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:32,117
- Most chains
have their own line of organics.

1674
01:05:32,158 --> 01:05:34,285
I mean, try getting Cartwright
on board with that.

1675
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:35,453
- Indeed.

1676
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:37,895
Now, are you thinking
of having any more kids?

1677
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:38,920
- I don't think so.
- Yeah.

1678
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:40,125
- Oh.

1679
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,690
- Come on.
- Well, excuse... - uh, hello.

1680
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:43,532
- We've been trying.
- Ah.

1681
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,800
- But Pete was an only child,
and so he doesn't understand

1682
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,636
why Henry would want
a brother or a sister.

1683
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:48,902
- Ah.

1684
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:51,103
Well, I came from a big family,
and I had a big family.

1685
01:05:51,144 --> 01:05:52,304
So I guess you're right.

1686
01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:54,108
- Oh, I have to take this.

1687
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:56,274
[Cell phone ringing]

1688
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:59,774
- This is just a thought,
Sara,

1689
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:03,277
but how would you feel
about moving to Los Angeles

1690
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:04,620
with your family?

1691
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:06,990
It's a nice place
to raise kids.

1692
01:06:07,027 --> 01:06:09,587
- Oh, I mean, we are not
attached to Long Island.

1693
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,756
- Well, I've been trying
to find a place for Pete

1694
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:13,766
in our national office.

1695
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,825
We know
you're a talented young man,

1696
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,666
good education.

1697
01:06:17,704 --> 01:06:20,002
You're a good guy,
an honest guy.

1698
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,032
I'd hate to see you
wasting your time in...

1699
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:25,601
well, in a regional office.

1700
01:06:25,645 --> 01:06:26,976
We'll find you something.

1701
01:06:30,884 --> 01:06:32,613
- Did I miss something?

1702
01:06:32,652 --> 01:06:34,119
- No, no, no.
- Really?

1703
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:35,314
- No.
- No.

1704
01:06:40,026 --> 01:06:42,927
- [Clears throat]

1705
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,161
- The motherfuckers at national
are screwing us up the ass.

1706
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,758
They're turning the vendors
against us.

1707
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:49,996
I saw the memos.

1708
01:06:50,036 --> 01:06:51,560
They don't want us
to make the deadline.

1709
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:53,037
- We're just gonna
have to stop relying on them

1710
01:06:53,073 --> 01:06:54,097
and do this ourselves.

1711
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,539
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1712
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:57,873
We're gonna get screwed
if we don't take care of this.

1713
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,003
- Matt had an idea.

1714
01:06:59,045 --> 01:07:00,137
- What?

1715
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,011
- Matt had an idea.

1716
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:05,347
- Yeah, okay, so we only have
a week and a half left.

1717
01:07:05,385 --> 01:07:06,511
Even though most of us

1718
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:08,019
are gonna work
through Christmas,

1719
01:07:08,053 --> 01:07:10,681
we still got to deal with HP
and Intellichoice closing

1720
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:12,213
and so is communications.

1721
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:13,554
And the store managers

1722
01:07:13,592 --> 01:07:15,822
are doing their whole
Christmas overtime thing, so...

1723
01:07:15,861 --> 01:07:17,761
- The bottom line is,
we're not gonna make it.

1724
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:19,764
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.

1725
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:21,595
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

1726
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:23,498
There isn't enough time
to get it all done.

1727
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:25,332
But if we were to cut

1728
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,396
just two, three
of the strategies,

1729
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:29,600
we'll be able to finish
everything else free and clear.

1730
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:32,132
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1731
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:36,406
- Does Susan know about this?

1732
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:40,578
- Well, we thought that maybe
you could talk to her.
