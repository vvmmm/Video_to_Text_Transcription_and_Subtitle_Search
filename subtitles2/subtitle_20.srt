00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,182
[Jason] Nice trousers, lads.

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,101
-What? [chuckles]
-Expecting a flood? Eh?

00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,146
[phone dings]

00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,874
Oh, shit.

00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,762
[Nikki] Your mum's just lost her mother,
so let's just really be there for her.

9
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,514
Yeah, well,
you only met my nan three times.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,100
The more you knew her,
the less sad it is, all right?

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,061
Mm.

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,897
Do you know they put
clotted cream on top of this?

13
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,066
Yeah. But be careful though,
that stuff will kill ya.

14
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,651
Oh, well, I hope not.

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,028
-'Cause I'm bringing some back with me.
-[chuckles]

16
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,866
God, it's so beautiful down here, Jase.

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,077
Yeah, I know. Yeah, we spent a lot
of summers down here when I was a kid.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,538
-Mm.
-Lot of memories down here.

19
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,956
-Mm.
-Hey. No way.

20
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,291
-What?
-Is that--

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,045
No way. Look there, do you see that? JR.

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,259
A lot of memories. [chuckles]

23
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,430
Okay. Well, should we crack on then?

24
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,265
Unless you two wanna catch up.

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,516
No, no.

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,227
That's funny. Okay.

27
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,024
That's funny.

28
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,043
Why'd your gran move
all the way down here?

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,336
Racism.

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,380
She, uh, she swore
she'd never leave the London house.

31
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,381
Mm.

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,218
She once had this motorway
diverted around it.

33
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,722
She got 10,000 people to sign a petition.
She's chained herself to a tree, right?

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,390
They've offered her an absolute fortune.

35
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,100
-Yeah.
-Immovable, she was.

36
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,395
Then a sweet Asian family
moves in next door,

37
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,272
and she was down here like a greyhound.

38
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,357
Oh, shit.

39
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,734
Oh, shit, shit.

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,240
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

41
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,827
-How are you?
-Good. You?

42
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,580
-Good, yeah. Yeah, you?
-[woman] Yeah, good.

43
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,960
Just, um, dropped off some flowers
from Mum.

44
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,423
Uh, Nikki Newman. This is Sky. Sky Jones.

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,968
All right.
Why you full-naming us? [chuckles]

46
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,219
-Hello.
-Hi.

47
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,681
So sorry about...

48
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,350
-Oh, no, it's all right. She was awful.
-Yeah, she was.

49
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,561
-[chuckles]
-She was ours though.

50
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,979
-[Jason] Yeah.
-She...

51
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,857
Wh-- Um, are you gonna come
to the memorial at the beach?

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,277
-Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's important for Mum.
-Yeah.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,320
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay. All right, yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,446
All right, then, see you later.

55
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,573
-See ya.
-Bye.

56
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,575
Nice to--

57
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,828
-Come on.
-That was an odd conversation.

58
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,496
No, it wasn't. It's good.
Good conversation.

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,873
-Are you joking me?
-What?

60
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,042
It was like you were stuck down a foxhole,
and you were radioing back to base.

61
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,378
"Good, yeah." [imitates radio static]
"Fine, yeah."

62
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,381
-"Over." Who was she?
-No one. Just someone I used to know.

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,591
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

64
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,884
-Sky Jones?
-Mm.

65
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,135
-Oh, okay.
-What?

66
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,054
-Was that the SJ from the pole?
-Maybe.

67
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,807
Why was she being weird, Jase?
Did you treat her badly?

68
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,642
-Did you break up with her?
-No, no.

69
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,227
We're still together.

70
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,441
Oh, remember, don't leave me alone with
your auntie. I never know what to say.

71
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,985
Talk about how expensive things are
in London. They love all that.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,528
-[Jason] Here he is.
-Hello.

73
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,488
-Hello, mate.
-Hi.

74
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,573
How are you?

75
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,492
Hello. Oh. Oh. [kisses]

76
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,578
-Go on, in you go, in you go.
-[Nikki] Thank you.

77
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,205
-They're all in there.
-Okay.

78
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,169
-Hi, Mum. You all right?
-Jason.

79
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,462
Hello, Janet.

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,005
Hi, you two.

81
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,507
-[man sighs]
-[Nikki whispers] Hello, hello.

82
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,470
How we doing, Sandra?

83
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,804
What?

84
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,849
I dunno. Just one of them, isn't it?

85
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,771
Right. Yeah, I suppose that--
that's a good way to think about it.

86
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,315
I'm so sorry for your loss, Janet.

87
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,443
It was three days ago,
so it's very much water under the bridge.

88
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,905
Right. Yeah.

89
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,159
Fact of life. [sighs]
Comes for everyone. Friends, family.

90
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,911
All the best ones from the Beatles.

91
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,624
I suppose the Pythons are dying roughly
in the order I'd hoped, so.

92
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,377
Everything's just bloody well
falling apart.

93
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,796
Do you know,
when it feels like that, Sandra,

94
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,842
I find it really useful to explore
positive affirmations.

95
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,760
The shed's falling down, Nikki.

96
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,889
Maybe you could pop out
and positively affirm it back up again.

97
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,975
-[mailbox clatters]
-Right.

98
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,226
Yeah.

99
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,567
How many "No junk mail" stickers
does she have to put up?

100
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,111
She hated junk mail!

101
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,571
-[door slams]
-[groans]

102
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,365
No, this is not right.

103
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,286
Oh, no, it's fine. It's just that
limestone makes it taste a bit funny.

104
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,416
[Nikki clears throat]

105
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:38,088
Oh, I should probably mention that I think
that Emmy's got a bit of a crush on me.

106
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,591
It's sort of developed over the last
few years. It's not a big deal.

107
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,218
She's at that age, you know,
and I'm the hot cousin, so.

108
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,095
All right. Are you sure?

109
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,930
Trust me. A man knows.

110
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,183
[chuckles]

111
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,893
[chatters indistinctly]

112
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,812
[scoffs]

113
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,526
[Nikki] Straight women
don't look at each other like that, Jason.

114
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,861
Unless they're in prison.

115
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,822
Bloody hell, Nikki. Not every young person
is a lesbian, you know.

116
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,282
[Sandra shouts indistinctly]

117
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,492
-I feel like your mum's so angry.
-Emmy!

118
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,704
I feel like she never gets a single moment
of calmness or peace.

119
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,247
But she's adapted to it though.

120
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,917
She's like one of those people that live
on a mountain that don't need much oxygen.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,044
Her mum's died. She--

122
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,214
She needs to engage her feelings a bit.

123
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,965
Please don't break my mum.

124
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,177
No, it's-- It's fine. It's a process.

125
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,972
We break her down, deal with everything
and then put her back together again.

126
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,475
I suppose we are only here for two days.

127
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,143
No, no, no. It'll be fine.

128
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,358
Hi, Sandra.

129
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,442
[sighs]

130
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,278
Do you have a moment?

131
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,785
I thought it might be nice...

132
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,413
for you to take a moment
just to breathe with me.

133
00:06:55,457 --> 00:07:00,087
[inhales, exhales]

134
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,589
Sometimes when everything's a bit hectic,

135
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:08,762
it's so important to carve out some time
to simply breathe. [exhales]

136
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,723
I just fit breathing into my day, Nikki.

137
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,441
-All cured?
-No.

138
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,614
[people chattering]

139
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,616
Don't you wanna know
what's underneath all that anger?

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,744
No, I'm pretty sure it's just anger,
all the way down.

141
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,205
Anger is such a pointless emotion.
There's something else going on.

142
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,958
-I don't think there is.
-There must be. Her mum just died.

143
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,919
-Yeah, but she was a hateful old racist.
-It doesn't matter.

144
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,212
Well, it takes the edge off, doesn't it?

145
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,755
Your family's just weird.

146
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,299
Yeah, but they're normal weird
though, aren't they?

147
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,633
Can we get the bill, please? Thank you.

148
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,719
They're not, like,
"check the hard drive" weird.

149
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,262
-Oh, my God.
-What?

150
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,972
Is that why they call her Sky?

151
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,224
-Because she's bloody everywhere.
-Where is she?

152
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,019
Oh, yeah. How funny.

153
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,439
I looked her up. She's an artist.

154
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,232
No, I think she just sells
old bits of driftwood.

155
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,651
Yeah, no, that's art down here.

156
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,403
I've always wanted to do arty stuff.

157
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,530
Look, anyone can be a bohemian here.

158
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,490
You've only gotta sell
one bamboo soap dish a week.

159
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,159
They'd all be homeless in London.

160
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,494
-Oh, will you stop? Please. C--
-What?

161
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,123
Look, it was 15-odd years ago, okay?

162
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,667
Aren't we past the stage
of being jealous of each other's exes?

163
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,835
-I'm not--
-Listen.

164
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,170
Your ex is still on our car insurance.

165
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,923
Yeah, only 'cause when I take him off,
it goes up.

166
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,219
[chuckles]

167
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,846
-What?
-[snorts] That kid really looks like you.

168
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,224
-Which one?
-The one with the big head.

169
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,475
There you go, sir.

170
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,851
-Thank you.
-Ta, thanks.

171
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,399
-âª Happy Birthday to you âª
-[Jason] Aw.

172
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,485
When did you say you two were together?

173
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,153
Like, 15 year...

174
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,740
âª Happy Birthday, dear Tristan âª

175
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,868
-âª Happy Birthday to you âª
-Years ago.

176
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,207
[Scott]
"Out of the shadows steps Frank Carter,

177
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,334
52 and looking it.

178
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:07,756
A hard-boiled, half glass of scotch
with an emptiness in his eyes.

179
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,093
A void, a gap, something unsaid.

180
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,054
He'll knock a man down,
but he'll help him up.

181
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,598
That's his code. That's his word.

182
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,143
He stands next to a woman, 28, attractive.

183
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,938
He knew they'd sent her to kill him.

184
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,024
But as the lonely rain
beat down on their faces,

185
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:31,154
he realized maybe, just maybe,
she was gonna save him too."

186
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,203
[chuckles] How can rain be lonely?

187
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,624
And why is it always raining in books
and films when people fall in love?

188
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,626
I mean, that's not real life, is it?

189
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,546
[smacks lips]
Okay, that-- Your tone, right there,

190
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,132
that's making me shrink slightly,
creatively.

191
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,719
I just think that you need to write
about something more personal.

192
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,804
Right.

193
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:59,391
And, you know,
writers need to know how to take feedback.

194
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,311
Let's just scooch on over
to the end there,

195
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,396
'cause it does--
it really does gather pace. Um--

196
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,608
Oh, great. Oh, and maybe we can do
a bit wedding prep before we have dinner.

197
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,151
Oh, but you're gonna
need the context, aren't you?

198
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,861
'Cause you're not gonna underst--

199
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,447
Okay, let's--
let's just take it from the top and, uh,

200
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,532
and really try and listen this time.

201
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,035
-Yeah, all right then.
-Okay.

202
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,662
[inhales deeply]

203
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,998
"Out of the shadows steps Frank Carter..."

204
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,753
I'm listening.

205
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,047
He doesn't look like me.

206
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,592
Are you kidding me?
Did you see his massive head?

207
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah,
I'm sure the dates don't match, okay?

208
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,222
-Anyway, his head wasn't even that big.
-[chuckles] Are you serious?

209
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,433
He looked like an Easter Island statue.
I'm surprised he didn't topple over.

210
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,060
All kids have got big heads, haven't they?

211
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,270
That's why they get their jumpers stuck
putting 'em on.

212
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,563
My mum used to have to
cut the collars down on mine.

213
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,648
Oh.

214
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,316
Well, it's hardly a DNA test, is it?

215
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,692
You don't go to the doctor's and he says,

216
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,819
"Well, yeah, I mean, he's got a big head.
That's close enough."

217
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,239
Jase, are we gonna have to move down here?
I don't know anyone down here.

218
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,573
Yeah, you do. You know Sky,

219
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,076
you know the kid with the big head
who might be my child.

220
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,911
-Are you taking this seriously?
-Not totally, no.

221
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,621
Can we just--
Can we just take a breath here.

222
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,665
You see one kid with a big head
and slightly curly hair,

223
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,792
now suddenly
we're putting offers in on houses?

224
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,669
And anyway, I'm...

225
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,339
relatively sure the dates don't match.

226
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,716
Come on.

227
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,637
[bell rings]

228
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh, God.

229
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,744
Are you hiding?

230
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,415
Oh. There's a woman showing off her baby
like it's a bloody Grammy,

231
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,541
so I'm taking a break.

232
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,627
-[chuckles] You're Miss Newman.
-Yeah.

233
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,963
I'm Deven. Raina's dad.

234
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh, Raina.

235
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:56,884
Raina with the socks.

236
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,804
-Yeah. [sighs] I'm working on that.
-Hmm.

237
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,972
She's a big fan.

238
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,642
Oh, well, that's lucky.
Most of them hate me.

239
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:10,355
[chuckles] Nah, you're just straight
with them. It's better in the long run.

240
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,316
Maybe.

241
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,445
Not all teachers are like
Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds.

242
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,906
Some of us are just doing it
for the 12 weeks holiday.

243
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,617
[chuckles] Ah, you're funny.

244
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,579
What? You don't know you're funny?

245
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,666
I never know what to do with compliments.

246
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,920
Well, keep 'em close to your heart.

247
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,423
[thunder rumbles]

248
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,884
[groans, grunts]

249
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,387
See you again, Miss Newman.
[exhales] I hope.

250
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
[thunder rumbles]

251
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:00,864
[lock clicks]

252
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,831
[screams]

253
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,003
[exhales]

254
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,839
[Janet] I don't know why we're doing this.

255
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,758
She didn't want a church, she wanted
a cremating. She said that.

256
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,054
Has she not got any tea?
I mean, she must have tea.

257
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,347
We'll go get some.

258
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,183
No, I want you to clear the shed with me.

259
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,018
It's not going up again,
so it's coming down.

260
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,814
[Janet] It's okay, here we go.
Ooh. [chuckles] Lots.

261
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,898
Janet.

262
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,485
Can you remember
when I was last here for the summer?

263
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,655
-When was it, 18, 19 years ago?
-Yeah, about then.

264
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,116
-[sniffing]
-Yeah. There you go. Thank you.

265
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,785
[Janet] No, I tell a lie.

266
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,996
It was the year we lost the dog.

267
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,583
Sixteen years and a bit. Almost 17.

268
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,131
Oh, God. [exhales]
You wanna adopt a teenager?

269
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,301
[sighs]

270
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,142
[exhales]

271
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,687
[sighs]

272
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,566
[sighs]

273
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,819
[groans]

274
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,872
Come on! [chuckles]

275
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,292
Oh, my Lord. Worse than I thought.

276
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,836
[sighs]

277
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,508
Look, Nikki, this doesn't prove anything.

278
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:48,347
-If that's my son, then w--
-Princess has a brother.

279
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,517
What? Why didn't they tell us?

280
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,604
They just have.
That was her brother in the video.

281
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,730
-What?
-Yeah.

282
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,524
[children chattering]

283
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,985
There's no one who can take both,
so they've, um, got to separate them.

284
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,073
[Jason] Princess has a brother.

285
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,409
Look at them, Jase.
How can they separate them?

286
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,203
Well, they've got no choice,
I suppose. They--

287
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,998
No. No-- [stammers]
No, that's not-- It's not right.

288
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,416
That's just-- I'm sorry, that's--

289
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,710
It's just not right
that that has to happen.

290
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,922
I'd be devastated if they tried
to separate me and Karen.

291
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,758
And that's Karen.
I didn't even like her till I was 31.

292
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,344
Well, we can help her, can't we?
That's part of our job.

293
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,596
No, it's just, it's not-- It's not fair!

294
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,474
So many things are not fair!

295
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:36,645
Honestly, Jase, people, they need
to start looking into all the unfairness.

296
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,149
Because, truthfully, there are people just
going along trying to be a good person,

297
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,945
enjoying some really nice ice cream,
and then God just thinks,

298
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,823
"Oh, she looks like
she's finally feeling happy.

299
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,118
Let's just throw a big-headed boy at her.
Let's really mess that up."

300
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,454
"Oh, does that nine-year-old girl
only have one person

301
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,248
in the whole entire world
that she can trust?

302
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,750
Oh, well, then let's just take him
away from her then."

303
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,961
And now some people have
more boys than they need,

304
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,881
and others just do not have enough,
and how is that fair?

305
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,760
-Okay, quite a lot to unpack there.
-"It's not," is the answer!

306
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:13,932
It sucks! [pants] It just sucks, and I'm--
Oh, I'm sick of it!

307
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:16,852
God.

308
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,438
[Emmy] I'm really sorry
we have to do this.

309
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,731
[continues indistinctly]

310
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,066
Hey. Nikki.

311
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,779
[groans, screams]

312
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,282
-What you doing?
-Nikki!

313
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,411
[screams]

314
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,206
Why is everything so hard?

315
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,585
[shouts]

316
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,010
I'm s-- I'm sorr-- I'm sorry.

317
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,595
-[breathes heavily]
-It's all right.

318
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,555
[object thuds]

319
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,604
Why did you die before I rang you back?

320
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:06,108
[groans] The-- The system! [grunts]

321
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,944
Just generally!

322
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,781
But I know everyone's doing their best!

323
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,285
-Bloody cancer! [cries]
-Sandra? Love?

324
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,871
People that say, "prosecco o'clock"!

325
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,080
[Sandra groans]

326
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,042
Talking about your grandchildren

327
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,963
around people who don't have any at all!

328
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,841
[yells]

329
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:32,970
Naturally... [grunts] ...wavy... [grunts]

330
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,724
...blonde-haired... [grunts] ...bitches!

331
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,812
I don't wanna die! [sobs]

332
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,315
[gasps]

333
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,573
[sniffing]

334
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,000
[Nikki sniffs]

335
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,668
[Sandra exhales]

336
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,258
I'm just gonna... [Emmy, indistinct]

337
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,515
Saves you a job, doesn't it?

338
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,311
-Why do you think you're...
-[clicks tongue] Oh. [sniffs]

339
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,980
She's gone, and I'm next.

340
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,901
[sighs]
It's getting late, and what have I done?

341
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,278
-God, you've done-- You've done loads.
-[scoffs]

342
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,822
Do you know...

343
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,785
I was 70 before I tried proper
dark chocolate.

344
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:44,041
-It was so... bittersweet.
-I know. It's horrible.

345
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,878
Because I thought of all the years
I've wasted not eating it.

346
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,129
[sobs]

347
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,798
Oh, I see. Yeah.

348
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,261
I wanna do something
I've never done before.

349
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,429
Yeah?

350
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,514
I wanna...

351
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,643
go to Yemen. [sighs]

352
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,064
Okay. Yeah, y-- you could go to Yemen.

353
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,650
-Can I?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

354
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,987
Or somewhere else.
Maybe somewhere with a beach.

355
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,198
Or a government.

356
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,366
[chuckles softly]

357
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,952
You can do whatever you want.

358
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,624
Thank you. [chuckles]

359
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,919
[sniffles] Oh.

360
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,338
She did want cremating.

361
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,883
People ignore you when you're old.
[sniffles, sighs]

362
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,301
Sandra.

363
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:43,100
There is not a single chance in hell
that people could ever ignore you.

364
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,351
[chuckles]

365
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,037
[Jason] Why you picking up the junk mail?
What you doing?

366
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,958
I'm not ignoring her.

367
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,465
[Jason] You all right, Rambo?

368
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,135
-Yeah, I think so.
-Yeah?

369
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,012
Just took some anger out on the shed.

370
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,181
-It's all right. I'm a bit scared though.
-Why?

371
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,141
Well, we haven't got a shed. [chuckles]

372
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,145
What if it changes things?

373
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,229
It won't.

374
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,818
What if you have a son and you realize
that you don't need any more kids?

375
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,863
I don't think children work like that.
I don't think they fill your heart up.

376
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,323
I think they actually
make your heart bigger

377
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,158
so that you've got
more room for stuff, so...

378
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,329
I don't wanna feel alone, 'cause,
you know, you'd have done it all before.

379
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,248
The thing that we're both trying to do
together, you'd have already done.

380
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,834
I haven't done anything.
He's 16 years old.

381
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,669
I've missed all the good bits.

382
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,172
Bit like turning up to a McCartney concert
where he's done "Hey, Jude,"

383
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,966
-now he's on to Frog Chorus.
-[both chuckle]

384
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,345
Look, whatever happens...

385
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,057
we'll be messing things up together.

386
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,851
All right?

387
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:11,813
Come on.

388
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,983
[Nikki sighs] If we can't cremate her,

389
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,027
at least we can cremate her junk mail.

390
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,825
Well, if it's a memorial,
we should say something nice about Gran.

391
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,119
-All of us?
-Yes.

392
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,918
Anyone wanna start?

393
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,923
-Jase.
-No, I'm-- I'm racking my b--

394
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,259
Um... [clicks tongue]

395
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,886
Oh! No one took clothes
back to a shop better than Nan, did they?

396
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,223
Do you remember? No receipt, no problem.
[chuckles softly]

397
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,308
Honestly, it was a superpower, Rakhi.

398
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,855
She'd never go to bed
till we rang to say we was home safe.

399
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,189
Yeah.

400
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,733
-We used to ring from Swindon...
-[chuckles]

401
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,110
...so she could get an early night.

402
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,445
[chuckles] Do you remember the hat?

403
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,658
She didn't trust CCTV, so when
she went to London, she wore a big hat.

404
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,077
Very incognito.
An 80-year-old in a sombrero.

405
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,787
[chuckles]

406
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,249
She was a tough old bird. [sniffs]

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,920
Buried two husbands, three sisters
and a couple of cats.

408
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,799
-[sniffs]
-And a lot of feelings.

409
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:24,511
Oh. Oh, yeah. [exhales]

410
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,680
The cats weren't hers, to be fair,
but, uh...

411
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,642
[sniffs]

412
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,103
Come on, scatter the ashes.

413
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,316
Right in the fire.

414
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,695
-[Emmy] We love you, Gran.
-[Jason] See ya, Nan.

415
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,113
[Janet] Rest in peace.

416
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,785
Oh. Look at this. [Sandra gasps]

417
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,835
[Nikki inhales, sniffs]

418
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,587
-You okay?
-Mm.

419
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,301
Oh.

420
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,846
Go.

421
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,640
Yeah?

422
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,099
Yeah.

423
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,354
Listen, if your mum can go to Yemen,
I can cope with whatever.

424
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,730
Okay.

425
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,774
-Who's going to Yemen?
-Just go.

426
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,324
-Go look for your granddad, all right?
-Oh. Yeah, all right.

427
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,867
-Hiya.
-[Sky] Hi.

428
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,285
-You all right?
-Yeah.

429
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,497
[Sky] Yeah. You all right?

430
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,874
-[Jason] How are you?
-Yeah, good. Good, you?

431
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,417
Good. Thanks for coming.

432
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,002
-No worry.
-Listen...

433
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,796
[chatters indistinctly]

434
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:45,551
Oh. I fancy some wine. [chuckles]

435
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,636
Do you fancy doing a bit of a run?

436
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,012
-Yeah.
-Yeah, totally.

437
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,558
Yeah? Okay.
[stammers] I need to write it down.

438
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,309
Janet, have you got a pen?

439
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:58,230
I'm a bit fussy when it comes to wine.
You might need to go to a few places.

440
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,065
-Gotcha, that's totally fine.
-Yeah, definitely.

441
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,484
Yeah? All right. So...

442
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,529
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

443
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,447
Yeah, me too.

444
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,575
Oh.

445
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,745
-Cool. Thank you. [chuckles]
-Come on, let's go. [chuckles]

446
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,211
[sighs] Mm.

447
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:28,010
Had a medium glass of red wine
in Leicester Square last week.

448
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,928
Cost me nine pounds, 20.

449
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,142
"Have fun"? [Emmy chuckles]

450
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,268
[Rakhi] Nice one, Nikki.

451
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,353
[both chuckle]

452
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,941
Freedom. [Emmy chuckles]

453
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:47,237
It's just that... [exhales] ...he does
have quite a big head, doesn't he?

454
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:51,116
And we were together at the time,
so the dates match.
