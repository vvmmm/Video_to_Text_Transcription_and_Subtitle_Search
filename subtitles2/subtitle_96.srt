00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,040
Oh great and mighty Rapu.

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,356
We pray to you.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,020
For water and sustenance.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,030
I pray to you, not for me...

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,080
But for my daughter.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,270
I'm tired.

9
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,380
Ah, what do we have here?

10
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
Look at it...

11
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,040
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

12
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,250
Rapu.

13
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,696
Bringer of light.

14
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,470
Oh, it's one of mine.

15
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,136
I am Gorr.

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
The last of your disciples.

17
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,880
We have lost everything, my lord.

18
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,786
The land is dry.

19
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,176
All life is lost.

20
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,246
But our faith in you never wavered.

21
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,370
And now we await the promise

22
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,730
of the eternal reward.

23
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,070
Is this why you celebrate?

24
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,880
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,656
No...
No, sorry.

26
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,450
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

27
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,220
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

28
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,066
We just vanquished the
holder of the Necrosword.

29
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,336
Before he could harm any
other gods with that cursed blade.

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,726
- You see...
- He threatened to end my entire empire.

31
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,310
Please lord...

32
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,960
Your empire is already ended.

33
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,086
There's no one left to worship you.

34
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,750
There'll be more followers to replace you.

35
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,446
There always are.

36
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,740
We have suffered...

37
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,030
And we have starved.

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,690
My daughter died

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,870
in your name.

40
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,260
And well, you should.

41
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,836
Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

42
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,966
There's nothing for you after death

43
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,030
except death!

44
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,550
You are not god.

45
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,660
I renounce you.

46
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,560
Now, your meaningless life

47
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,290
finally does have a purpose.

48
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,960
To sacrifice yourself to me.

49
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,206
So it's revenge you seek...

50
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,606
Kill all the gods.

51
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,656
Go to Eternity.

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,950
It's revenge you seek.

53
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,246
Summon the Bifrost...

54
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,136
Go to Eternity...

55
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,496
Summon the Bifrost...

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,570
Go to Eternity.

57
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,410
So the sword chose you...

58
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,200
But you are now cursed.

59
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,686
Funny...

60
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,630
It doesn't feel like a curse.

61
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,840
It feels like a promise.

62
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,090
So this is my vow...

63
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,010
All gods will die.

64
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,450
Come, gather round...

65
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,810
And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

66
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,520
A.k.a. "The God of Thunder".

67
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,520
A.k.a. "Thor Odinson".

68
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,130
Raised in the way of the Warrior...

69
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,836
Thor was taught to help bring balance.

70
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,580
Fighting the good fight, for
those who can't fight good.

71
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,946
He grew.

72
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,276
And he grew.

73
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,106
And he grew.

74
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,440
He was sensitive, like a smile.

75
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,200
And his loving nature did not discriminate.

76
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,750
He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.

77
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,946
Another time, he loved a wolf woman

78
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,040
on a woman wolf.

79
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,090
But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

80
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,326
Oh, wait, no...

81
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,196
Jane Foster.

82
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,226
But sadly...

83
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,700
In the battle for love, Thor lost.

84
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,446
In fact,
he lost a lot of people in those days.

85
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,746
His mum.

86
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,960
His dad.

87
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,496
And that guy.

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,510
And that guy...

89
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,896
And whoever that is.

90
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,210
And Heimdall.

91
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,170
And his brother.

92
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,830
And his brother again.

93
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,160
And again.

94
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,820
Poor Thor had to watch
his planet explode.

95
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,736
And then he said, "What have I done?"

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,266
It seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

97
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,160
And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...

98
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,670
So it could never be broken again.

99
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,676
But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

100
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,740
He teamed up with
the Guardians of the Galaxy,

101
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,710
and set off on some
classic Thor adventures.

102
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,426
He got in shape...

103
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,300
Putting in the hard yards...

104
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,230
Turning pains into gains...

105
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,670
And never skipping leg day.

106
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,260
He went from dad bod to god bod.

107
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,726
But beneath his god bod...

108
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,510
There was still still a sad bod,
just trying to get out.

109
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,400
Because all of the bods that
Thor had worn over the years...

110
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,100
Couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,306
So, he gave up his search for love.

112
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,300
Accepting that he was
only good for one thing.

113
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,116
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...

114
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,016
Thor...

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,390
We need your help
to win this battle.

116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,486
Thor...

117
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,356
We need your help
to win this battle.

118
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,620
Let's go.

119
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,030
Oh, okay.

120
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,240
Come on, Storm breaker.

121
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,580
Let's hurry, okay?

122
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,000
People are dying.

123
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,100
See you down there.

124
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,070
Hurry up!

125
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,920
Gimme those!

126
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,180
You're gonna break 'em.

127
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,000
- I am Groot!
- Oh, you got sap all over it.

128
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,630
Hello, everybody!

129
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,796
Well, well...
Look who it is!

130
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,380
- How are we doing, guys?
- Horrible!

131
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
We're all going to die!

132
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,950
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

133
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,040
I said it was going to
be like a relaxing holiday.

134
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,456
Well, look at our resplendent skyscape,
three suns are setting.

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,386
What can be more relaxing than that?

136
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,040
An actual holiday!

137
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,270
Die, mutant scum!

138
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,690
- God of Thunder!
- King Yakan.

139
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,026
You have finally joined our fight.

140
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, as they say,
better late than not at all.

141
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,760
It is very nice.

142
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,046
As you know, we
used to live in the peaceful oasis.

143
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,836
- But then, our gods were murdered.
- Murdered?

144
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,070
And now, our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

145
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,190
And Habooska's hordes took control
of its power.

146
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,746
It is our most sacred shrine he desecrates.

147
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,830
Not for long.

148
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,786
King Yakan...

149
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,736
Tell them what happened here today.

150
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,000
Tell of the time that Thor...

151
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,706
And his ragtag, motley crew of misfit
desperados...

152
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,180
Found the time to battle and
etch their names in history.

153
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,136
The odds may be against us...

154
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,540
- But I'll tell you this for free.
- Here it comes.

155
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,920
This ends here, and now!

156
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,960
He's not going to go into the temple, is
he, no...

157
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,050
Well done, everybody.

158
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,350
We can collectively take credit for that,
because we worked as a team.

159
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,976
We used our hearts and
our minds to defeat the enemy...

160
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,010
With minimal loss or damage.

161
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,696
What a classic Thor adventure.

162
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,110
Hurrah!

163
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,926
Good book?

164
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,950
Yeah.

165
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,040
I wrote it.

166
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,720
You're...
You're Dr. Jane Foster?

167
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,356
I am.

168
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,760
- Hi!
- Hi!

169
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,540
How's the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

170
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,126
It's tough.

171
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,350
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

172
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,320
It's... you need a 3D model.

173
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,136
You ever see Event Horizon?

174
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
No.

175
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,876
- Interstellar?
- No.

176
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,790
That movie explains
everything really clearly.

177
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,537
Um, alright.

178
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,326
The Einstein-Rosen
bridge folds space...

179
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:05,120
So that point A and point B coexist
in space and time, like that.

180
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,956
You just ruined your own book.

181
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,660
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

182
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,510
- You watch those movies.
- Okay.

183
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,390
Saw the hot Cheetos.
Had to get it.

184
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,836
So how's uh...
How's it going?

185
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,940
It's going amazing.

186
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,366
Have you...

187
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,980
Told anyone else besides me?

188
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,856
When people find out
they start acting weird.

189
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,186
They're just

190
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,210
different.

191
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,796
I don't need that in my life right now.

192
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,340
Anyway, it's not that serious.

193
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,260
Jane, it's stage four.

194
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,350
Out of like, how many stages?

195
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,600
- Four.
- That we know about.

196
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Oh, you have uh...

197
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,346
Somewhere else you gotta be right now,
that's more important than chemo?

198
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,400
No...

199
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,350
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

200
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,010
- I have a few ideas I'm trying.
- Okay, no. Time out.

201
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,266
I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do.

202
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,000
Otherwise, you're letting
down all of civilization, but...

203
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,896
You're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

204
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,660
So let me translate.

205
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,206
Slow.
Down.

206
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,060
You need your energy to fight this thing.

207
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,280
I'll fight it my way, okay?

208
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,836
Well, FYI...

209
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,710
"My way" does not have
to equal alone in a lab.

210
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,480
Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

211
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,786
- It's not a card.
- Yes, it is.

212
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,530
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

213
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,226
It's tall, it's blonde,
and it's gorgeous.

214
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,526
It is a handsome card.

215
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,366
Jane, are you sure?

216
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,436
I will figure this out...

217
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,670
By myself.

218
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,960
Results are just
coming back the same.

219
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,870
I'm afraid the chemo
has very little effect.

220
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm so sorry, Jane.

221
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,220
If there's anything I can do
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

222
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,870
Smell like a king...

223
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,910
Because you're worthy.

224
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,140
Old Spice.

225
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Cut!

226
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,650
Look at this place.
It's beautiful, home.

227
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,216
Yes, home, Father.

228
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,870
- We're here to take you home.
- Yes.

229
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,860
To Planet Asgard.

230
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,666
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

231
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,056
It is a people.
It is you.

232
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,200
And now it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

233
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,366
I will take my place

234
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:23,000
in the great banqueting hall of Valhalla,
the resting place of the gods.

235
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,750
Oh, one more thing.

236
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,180
You have a sister.

237
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,886
And so now I turn into godly
stardust and say farewell.

238
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,910
Oh, look.

239
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,536
Do you see?

240
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,316
It's happened.

241
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,550
I've disappeared.

242
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,070
- No!
- Father!

243
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,800
But wait, brother!

244
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,350
An ominous portal has appeared behind us.

245
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,880
Transform!

246
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,486
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

247
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,826
Now, I return to Asgard, to stake my
claim as the rightful heir to the throne.

248
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,760
And no one will stop me!

249
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,637
Join me or die.

250
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,120
- We'll never join you, witch.
- MjÃ¶lnir.

251
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,340
Impossible!

252
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,800
I broke your hammer!

253
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,340
Time to die!

254
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,470
- Bifrost!
- Bifrost!

255
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,056
You can almost feel the power

256
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,460
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

257
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,930
Okay, let's head back to the village

258
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,166
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

259
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,240
Come on.

260
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,020
God of Disaster...

261
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,216
We thank you.

262
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,180
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods.

263
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,606
But now, peace shall reign.

264
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,430
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

265
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,170
It is tradition, the protectors of our
world are bestowed with great beasts.

266
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,640
- Giant goats?
- Oh, look at those. They are wonderful.

267
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,616
Korg, look at that.
I think they're beautiful.

268
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,936
King Yakan, thank you so much.

269
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,830
Listen um...
about the temple.

270
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,326
- I don't want to talk about the temple.
- I know, but if we were to talk about it.

271
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,020
- I think it's important to...
- It's making me sad and mad.

272
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,426
Okay, I'll stop talking.

273
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,806
Don't forget the goats.

274
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,386
Which you accepted and
now must take with you.

275
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,440
No backsies.

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,010
Aww, they are beautiful.

277
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,430
Yes, they are beautiful.

278
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,930
- They also scream quite a lot.
- They'll be fine.

279
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,980
We need to find the damn remote, so
we can download the distress signal.

280
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,620
Well then retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

281
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,676
One of the goats
probably ate it.

282
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,616
The goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,906
I ain't digging through that crap.

284
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,876
Unload them.

285
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,196
- If you need me, let's pull over.
- Found the remote.

286
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,736
I'm putting them down.

287
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,500
Me too!

288
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,036
No, it's not working.
It's not charged.

289
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,610
Well maybe, you need
to find the charger.

290
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,634
- Get out of the way!
- Whoa, whoa whoa!

291
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,016
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

292
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,256
Alright.
Everybody, just relax.

293
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,506
The goats are going to be fine.

294
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,320
If not, we can just use them for meat.

295
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,826
- Ting people.
- Meet-ing people.

296
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,347
They're a great conversation starter.

297
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:05,811
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle.

298
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,290
It goes something like this.

299
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
No, that's not it.

300
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
No, that's not it.

301
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,990
No, that's not it, you have a go.

302
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:12,736
No, that's not it.

303
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,430
- Oh, hey, guys!
- Kraglin!

304
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,276
You've been here
this whole time?

305
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,146
Yeah, you said to
stay with the ship.

306
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,210
This is Glenda.
We're married.

307
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,380
I am Groot.

308
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,980
What did we tell you about
jumping into new relationships?

309
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,856
- That I shouldn't be that.
- Yeah!

310
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200
You can't be get married on
every single planet we land on.

311
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,460
I am Groot.

312
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,490
Finally!

313
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,810
Alright, here we go.
"Distress Calls".

314
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,330
Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

315
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,396
God Butcher?

316
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,600
- He left us hanging.
- It's a warning!

317
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,156
All of these gods murdered.

318
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,136
Our greatest champions...

319
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,096
Now laid to waste.

320
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,430
The horror.

321
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,060
Who could have done something like this?

322
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,486
- Thor, where are you?
- Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,930
What was that?
Go, go, go back.

324
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,130
Play that one.

325
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,860
Thor, where are you?

326
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,560
- Sif.
- We need you here.

327
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,150
Well, my friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

328
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,886
Start the ship, my friends.

329
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,710
Oh. Maybe,
we should split up.

330
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,426
So many people to save, I mean.

331
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,360
Look at all these distress... calls.

332
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,140
Thor, you gonna be okay?

333
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,350
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

334
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,296
Alas, it's something
I'll never have.

335
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,286
Buddy, if I may.

336
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,310
You may.

337
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,346
After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.

338
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,890
I've been lost before.

339
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,880
But then I found meaning,
I found love.

340
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,310
And yeah, It got taken
from me, and god, that hurts.

341
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,650
But that shitty feeling is
better than feeling empty.

342
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,750
My hope for you is that one day,
you will find something...

343
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,636
To make you feel this shitty.

344
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,910
I have loved before.

345
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,576
It didn't work out.

346
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,406
They either die a brutal death or
they dump you with a handwritten letter.

347
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,470
I don't know which is worse, but it's
why I keep everyone at arm's length.

348
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,586
You've grown too attached, damn it!
I knew this would happen.

349
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,810
You must go!

350
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,406
I'll find, Sif.

351
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,776
You answer the other calls.

352
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,326
The Galaxy needs its guardians.

353
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,976
- Cool, yeah. We were just leaving.
- Shhh, I know it hurts.

354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,210
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

355
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,520
To ease the pain,
why don't you uh...

356
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,336
Take this ship here,
as a parting farewell gift.

357
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,566
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

358
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,506
Yes, she's yours.

359
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,160
May you make as many
memories with her as I have.

360
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,106
She's a temperamental old lass,

361
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,400
but will serve you well,
in a tight pickle.

362
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,516
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

363
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,040
Goodbye, old friend.

364
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,130
Human handshake.

365
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,360
Asgardian shake.

366
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,400
Into the snake that
you cannot trust.

367
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,890
- Really dragging this out...
- To finish, the classic Asgardian high one.

368
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,166
- Let's go.
- Take care of my crew.

369
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,206
It's going to be hard for them.

370
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,516
- Hurry up!
- Not her.

371
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,870
Remember what I told you.

372
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,240
You ever feel lost?

373
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,010
Just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

374
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,130
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

375
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,450
Alright, bye.

376
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,976
Wadsworth, let's bring to the good
memories. (?)

377
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,186
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens".

378
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,810
I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead, and...

379
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,966
They're gone.

380
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,856
Alone again, just me and you.

381
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Storm breaker!

382
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,650
Watch out ya freakin' crazy ax.

383
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,776
So what do we do now, bro?

384
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,040
Let's go get Sif.

385
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,576
Who or what is that?

386
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,890
Falligar,
God of the Phaligarians.

387
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,970
One of the nicest
gods you'll ever meet.

388
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:07,394
Oh, no.

389
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,370
Sif!
It's me, Thor.

390
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,810
Odinson.

391
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,180
You're missing an arm.

392
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,396
Let me get you home.

393
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,287
No!

394
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,556
Leave me here.

395
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,650
I want to die a warrior's death.

396
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,866
On the battlefield, in battle.

397
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,396
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

398
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,010
Oh, I hate to break it to you.

399
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,786
But for a warrior
to get into Valhalla,

400
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,906
you have to die in the battle.

401
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,336
- You survived.
- Oh, shit!

402
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,610
Maybe, your arm is in Valhalla.

403
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,940
What happened to you?

404
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,480
I've been hunting a madman.

405
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,946
I followed him here but.

406
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,410
- It was a trap.
- Who is this madman?

407
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,786
The God Butcher is coming.

408
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,386
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

409
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,070
Asgard is next.

410
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,550
- Look, it's Thor! Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

411
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,170
Hey! Who'd you piss off now?

412
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,926
It's not my fault.

413
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,006
I've never even seen these things,
whatever the hell they are.

414
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,170
Welcome back.

415
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,006
Who's the new guy?

416
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,510
Oh, that guy...
You're gonna love that guy.

417
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,666
MjÃ¶lnir.

418
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,286
MjÃ¶lnir!

419
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,706
It's me, Thor.

420
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,830
Have you seen my hammer?

421
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,660
MjÃ¶lnir, here boy.

422
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
MjÃ¶lnir?

423
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
MjÃ¶lnir.

424
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,280
You're back.

425
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
MjÃ¶lnir!

426
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,610
'Scuse me.
Hello.

427
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,070
That's my hammer you've got there.

428
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,250
And that's my look.

429
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,230
Hey!

430
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,260
Enough tomfoolery, wench.

431
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,530
You take off that mask
and reveal yourself.

432
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:58,554
C'mon.

433
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,450
Hey.

434
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,890
Jane?!

435
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,260
Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.

436
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,306
He was a God of Thunder.

437
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,790
And she, a woman of science.

438
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,070
And although they were
from different worlds...

439
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,150
Somehow, it just made sense.

440
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,540
And together, they embarked
on a journey of love.

441
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,690
Thor taught Jane
the way of the warrior.

442
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,640
And Jane taught Thor
the way of the people.

443
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,380
And as time passed, their
love grew deeper and deeper.

444
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,450
She's incredible,
isn't she, MjÃ¶lnir?

445
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,700
I need you to promise me that
you'll always protect her.

446
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,660
I love you too, buddy.

447
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,650
A love that deep has a way
of becoming magical.

448
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,520
Thor set his sights towards a future
and all it might hold.

449
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,946
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

450
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,386
And although Jane didn't want to admit it,

451
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,610
she was scared of loss as well.

452
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,730
And so, they built walls between them.

453
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,980
Thor got busy, saving humanity.

454
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,350
Heimdall!

455
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,630
And Jane got busy, doing the same.

456
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Real busy.

457
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,360
And eventually, the space
between them grew and grew.

458
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,550
Until it became too wide to bear.

459
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,786
Something had to give.

460
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,870
I have to stay up all night,
to go through this data, okay?

461
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,956
I have to stay up all night
and clean all of this up.

462
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,800
There's two plates!

463
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,324
There's two plates and two forks...

464
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,490
And then one night, it did give.

465
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,530
Jane wrote a note.

466
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,630
And Thor read that note.

467
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,510
And their legend
suddenly became myth.

468
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,370
Or so they thought.

469
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,430
You okay?

470
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,926
Uh, heh.

471
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,630
It's a little, uh, hot, and...

472
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,846
I suddenly feel...

473
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,590
It's claustrophobic
with the, the helmet, it's...

474
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,050
How?!

475
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,636
Can we talk about this later?

476
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,720
Yeah, sure.

477
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,300
Great seeing you!

478
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,090
What?

479
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,230
Hey! Is that the Necrosword?

480
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,026
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

481
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,120
Then, you know
this is going to hurt.

482
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,456
Pain.

483
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,876
What is pain, but a construct
invented by the weak.

484
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,370
Oh, okay!
That's very sharp!

485
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Ready?

486
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't touch my thing.

487
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,900
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

488
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,350
The children! They're taking the children!

489
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,616
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

490
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,996
- Dad!
- Mom!

491
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Mom!

492
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,660
Shadow monsters, disgusting.

493
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,006
I flew around the world twice, nothing.

494
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,750
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

495
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,916
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Ah, you're telling me.

496
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,076
What's it been like?
Three, four years?

497
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,580
Eight years, seven months and six days.

498
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,756
I haven't forgotten.

499
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,710
The last time I saw you or
didn't see you, because you left.

500
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,006
It's kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

501
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,226
Ah, no, you left.
You did.

502
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,566
You wrote me
a beautiful handwritten letter.

503
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,670
I should know, I was there.

504
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,926
- You weren't there, actually.
- I was.

505
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,370
Hence the note...

506
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,800
And if you weren't there to see me
leave, then maybe it was you that left.

507
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,310
Fair point.

508
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,246
- Not that it matters, like...
- No.

509
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,820
- Who's keeping track, right?
- Yeah.

510
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,460
I suppose we both left and both got left.

511
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,000
Now, you're leaving again.

512
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,120
Miek, we need detailed
accounts from all the witnesses.

513
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,920
Darryl, get me all the names of the
children who've been lost.

514
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,520
Your Majesty, my daughter's been taken.

515
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,296
And she'll be found.

516
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,140
Guys, they're bleeding!
Get them to the infirmary, now!

517
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,956
- Darryl!
- Majesty.

518
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,330
Should we start working on a
performance of this entire debacle?

519
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,890
The people need entertainment.

520
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,737
Particularly now,
in times of crisis.

521
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,761
Particularly.

522
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,540
I did not hear a "no".

523
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,290
Nor did I.

524
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,746
Asgard, at night.

525
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,100
We open on some
sleeping children.

526
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,756
So that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

527
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,186
- The old ex-girlfriend.
- Jodie Foster.

528
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,076
- Jane Foster.
- The one that got away.

529
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,266
The one that got away.

530
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,150
- That means escaped.
- Yeah.

531
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,620
Yeah.

532
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,996
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

533
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,320
and your ex-hammer hanging out
and getting on so well.

534
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,060
What you up to, bro?

535
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
Come on.

536
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,950
Come to daddy.

537
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,270
Come on, MjÃ¶lnir.

538
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,840
Hey, there you are!

539
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,386
Hey!

540
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,416
- I was just calling you.
- Start an army.

541
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,110
With what?

542
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,320
- Half our soldiers are dead.
- Half our soldiers are always dead.

543
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,236
- Everyone, please. Go home.
- Where are the children?

544
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,416
And I promise you,
we'll have news soon.

545
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,036
- I don't know.
- Can't go far.

546
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,076
I think the worst has happened.

547
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,150
She'll find them.

548
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,390
You know what?

549
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,130
Asgard!

550
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,260
My friends, we must not quarrel.

551
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,630
In times like this, we need
to unite, come together,

552
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,290
and see what's happening here.

553
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,816
We're afraid.

554
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,940
Hm?

555
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,970
Scared.

556
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,796
Afraid.

557
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,860
Anxious.

558
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,716
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

559
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,840
I am sorry. Miek.

560
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,396
It's very hard to give a rousing
speech with the eh-eh-eh noise.

561
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,947
What are you doing?

562
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,491
- She's taking minutes.
- Well, precious minutes. We don't have.

563
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,340
Want the kids back?

564
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,450
I'll be back in a minute.

565
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,520
You write that down, Miek.

566
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,330
Storm breaker,
what are you doing?

567
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,026
Is this about MjÃ¶lnir?

568
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,090
Everyone out!

569
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,006
Couldn't find 'em.

570
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,356
Bro, your cape's on fire.

571
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,416
It's fine, it'll grow back.

572
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,236
I'm invoicing you for this.

573
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,080
Listen.

574
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,246
What do we know about this guy?

575
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,640
He travels through shadows.

576
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,180
And he creates
monsters with them.

577
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,990
Absolutely, freaky monsters.

578
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,376
He also wields the Necrosword.

579
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,096
How do I know that?

580
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,536
Because he almost speared
me in the face with it.

581
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,610
What's a Necrosword?

582
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,910
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands, since the dawn of time.

583
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,140
It has the ability to slay gods.

584
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,296
But it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

585
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,236
- Oh, so it infected him.
- It's infecting him. Yes, it must be.

586
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,206
So basically, we're up against a
cursed, shadow, zombie kidnapper.

587
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,836
Awesome!
When do we leave?

588
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,776
Thor?

589
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,016
- Can you see me?
- Uh, floating head alert.

590
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,210
It's Astrid,

591
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,260
Heimdall's son.

592
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,980
Astrid, are you okay?

593
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,056
I no longer go by the name, Astrid.

594
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,296
I'm now known as Axl.

595
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,566
He's a singer from a
popular band I heard on Earth.

596
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,380
GNR.

597
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:52,997
Astrid...

598
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,520
Your father gave you a very tough Viking
name and I intend to honor his wishes.

599
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,770
- Axl.
- Astrid.

600
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,080
- I said, Axl.
- Astrid.

601
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,690
- Axl!
- He's Axl! Now, listen to him.

602
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,550
Alright, fine.
"Axl"...

603
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,576
- Where are you?
- I'm not sure.

604
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,336
I don't know how to
use my magic powers yet.

605
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,906
Your father taught me
and I'm going to teach you.

606
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,826
I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

607
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,836
Okay, good.

608
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,760
Now, focus.
Close your eyes.

609
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,560
Thor!

610
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,056
Hey!
How's it going, kids?

611
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,790
How's it going?
Look where we are.

612
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,426
We're in a cage made of spikes.

613
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,296
Yeah, that's right.
Not good.

614
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,310
- Are you gonna do something?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

615
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,130
But just not right now.
I'm a vision ghost, look.

616
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,460
- See.
- What will happen to us?

617
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,100
You can tell,
this is a very, very bad situation.

618
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,676
You know, the good news
is, you're Asgardians.

619
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,916
So if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

620
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,440
Oh, my God, go away.

621
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:52,464
Wait, wait, wait...

622
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,486
Okay, well...

623
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,376
Alright, right, don't cry.
Don't cry, it's okay.

624
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,890
Listen, I got a plan, okay.

625
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,856
I'm putting together a
really, really good team.

626
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,230
We've got um, uh...

627
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,590
Uncle Korg.

628
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,780
King Valkyrie.

629
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,567
Um, yeah...

630
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:08,606
My ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
'nother story I won't bore you with, okay?

631
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,676
But it is a top notch team, and we're
gonna have you home before you know it.

632
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,700
Yeah.

633
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,210
I know where you are.

634
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,710
I'm gonna get you out of here.

635
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,116
I'm scared.

636
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
We all are.

637
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,087
- Thor.
- Please.

638
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,176
Look out for them.
Take care. Okay, take care.

639
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,520
I'll see you soon, alright?
Axl, get me out of here.

640
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,266
They're in the Shadow Realm.

641
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,536
How do you know?

642
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,106
The atmosphere there has
a darkness like no other.

643
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,676
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

644
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,076
Well then,
if it's color we need.

645
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,340
Let's bring the rainbow.

646
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,546
Bring the rainbow? Is that a
catchphrase or something?

647
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,270
She's only been a
Thor for a minute.

648
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,166
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest of it, she needs work.

649
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,110
- How many catchphrases have there been?
- A lot.

650
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,396
Yep, jumped the gun.

651
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,696
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the shadow realm.

652
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,456
It seems like that's where he's
going to be the most powerful.

653
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,066
You're right. We can't
just go marching in there.

654
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,146
It could be a trap.
We'd be endangering the children.

655
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,166
We need reinforcements.
We must raise an army.

656
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,476
Are you thinking what I
think you're thinking?

657
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,036
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

658
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,580
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

659
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,706
(both) Omnipotent City.

660
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,640
What's Omnipotent City?

661
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,946
It's the home of the most
powerful gods in the universe.

662
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,946
We can pull together
the greatest team ever.

663
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,576
We can recruit Ra,
Hercules, TÅ«matauenga...

664
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,010
QuetzalcÃ³atl, maybe.

665
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,760
And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

666
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,496
- Did you say, Zeus?
- Yes, Zeus.

667
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,096
Like the Zeus.
Zeus Zeus.

668
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,750
I'm not sure if
he has a second name.

669
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,886
Do you think my god will be there,
Ninny of the Nonny?

670
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,696
Ah, you never know Korg, but if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

671
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,576
Yes!

672
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Storm breaker.

673
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300
Calm down, relax.

674
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,006
No, no, no, mate.

675
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,250
We are not traveling in
Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

676
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,346
Look what just happened.

677
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,240
We can't exactly go in your tiny
little flying portal horse, can we?

678
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,576
- We won't all fit.
- What are you talking about?

679
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,380
Warsong's awesome.

680
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,736
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

681
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,200
Storm breaker just
needs a conduit.

682
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,646
Anything that can
handle space travel.

683
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,090
I love it when she talks shop.

684
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,486
If it has the power
to get us there,

685
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,986
It just needs something
to focus that energy.

686
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,320
So it's not so...
unpredictable.

687
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:12,926
You know, uh.

688
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,946
If we had a ship, we could harness it
and use Storm breaker as a power source.

689
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,160
Ooh, like an engine.

690
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,320
- Like an engine.
- You need a ship?

691
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,620
I've got a ship.

692
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,436
Throw all those seats.

693
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,590
There you go.
Now, tie those goats to the front.

694
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,210
We leave in 15 minutes.

695
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,166
Essentials only, everyone.

696
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,980
That's essential.
Mmhm.

697
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,440
Well you moved on quick, didn't you.

698
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,350
You are some piece of work.

699
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,286
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

700
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,696
- Catching up with an old friend.
- Yeah.

701
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,726
I've been meaning to apologize.

702
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,216
Sort of acting a little weird before.

703
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,556
I just haven't really been myself lately.
You know, kinda...

704
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,650
Trying to figure out who I am and
uh, just felt a little bit lost.

705
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,736
And then all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me.

706
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,706
And it was, kinda...

707
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,806
It's a lot for me, too.

708
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,070
So how did uh

709
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,040
you guys get together?

710
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,276
How did this happen?

711
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,666
I swear, I heard
MjÃ¶lnir call to me.

712
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,116
Ah, did it?

713
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,076
And so I came here to investigate and...

714
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,256
- Its pieces started glowing and swirling, and then...
- Crazy.

715
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,026
Thor.

716
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,440
Huh. Well, you know what. It looks
good on you. It works, so...

717
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Just checking.

718
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,780
See you later.

719
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,216
What?

720
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,690
We were just talking.

721
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,896
Mommy, don't leave me.

722
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,936
Don't be afraid.

723
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,390
Even when I'm gone, honey.

724
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,030
You won't be alone.

725
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,000
And whatever happens...

726
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,700
Never stop fighting.

727
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,896
- Hey.
- You alright?

728
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,220
Great!

729
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,950
The sink would say otherwise.

730
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,406
You think I really
should be coming?

731
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,036
I'm not getting any better.

732
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,146
You're a Thor.
Of course, you should come.

733
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,600
Besides, what else
are you gonna do?

734
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,186
You're a Viking now.

735
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,286
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle.

736
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,580
It needs to be
devastatingly painful.

737
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,516
Otherwise, you
don't get into Valhalla.

738
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
My plan.

739
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,320
What about you
kinging and stuff?

740
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,886
I love being king.

741
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:57,857
I love my people.

742
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:59,520
But it's all meetings
and raven mail.

743
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,306
And meetings that could
have been raven mail.

744
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,686
I miss fighting.

745
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,966
I miss my sisters.

746
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,166
Which is why you need to come.

747
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,240
Because I need one.

748
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,510
- Okay, we should go.
- Hmm. - You packed?

749
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,300
Are you packed?

750
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Yes.

751
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,420
A hand grenade?

752
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,000
No, it's a portable speaker.

753
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,546
Let's go.

754
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,990
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps.

755
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,020
I got you.

756
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,696
My fellow Asgardians...

757
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,650
Wish us well.

758
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,770
For we shall travel with
the speed of Odin's ravens.

759
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,730
We will return with children.

760
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,430
Many children.

761
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,540
Then we shall feast,
not on the children.

762
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,296
We do not do that anymore.

763
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,886
Those were dark times.

764
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,660
Shameful times.

765
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,970
Okay, we should go.

766
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,296
So...
You still rollerblading?

767
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,106
No, no.
You?

768
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,500
Oh yeah, every weekend.

769
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,880
Once you blade, you never fade.

770
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,626
- Right, Korg?
- Skate mates for life.

771
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,936
Hey, can I run something by you?

772
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,706
Yeah.

773
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,376
So I was thinking,
when we get to the bad guy...

774
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,206
What about if I had, like,
the cool catchphrase, like...

775
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,310
"Eat this hammer, bang!"

776
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,680
Or like?

777
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,770
"Check out my hammer, boom!"

778
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,316
Like, what about, uh...

779
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,470
No... Ah,
I'm work shopping it, I...

780
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,996
No, they... They're all
really good. Mine is uh...

781
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,650
"This ends here and now."

782
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,226
Oh, that's such a good one.

783
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,586
Took me a long
time to perfect it.

784
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,026
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

785
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,566
This is my first bad guy.

786
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,890
You never forget your first.

787
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,570
Yeah.

788
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,176
So you got a girlfriend?

789
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,830
Oh, no, no.

790
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,246
Too busy. Don't have time.
You know, just...

791
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,210
With work and everything.

792
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,040
Cool.

793
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,240
Let me check this place out.

794
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,986
So cool.

795
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,286
- Who's so cool?
- Huh?

796
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,256
The buildings are cool.

797
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,390
What's happening there?

798
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,190
- What?
- Am I, uh...

799
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,840
Sensing feelings?

800
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,640
Feelings, what?
With Jane?

801
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,460
- Yeah.
- No, don't be ridiculous, feelings.

802
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,736
The last time we had feelings
were a long time ago. Long, long gone.

803
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,600
Not even...
Maybe you have feelings.

804
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,780
Mate, relax.
We're on the same team.

805
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,186
I know exactly what
team we're on, okay.

806
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,250
Team Jane.

807
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,840
The thing about Thor is that
he always bounces back.

808
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,680
Like when Hela stole his
hammer, he went and built an ax

809
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,900
which is forged from
the heart of a dying star.

810
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,750
And it's that same ax which
he used to cut off Thano's head.

811
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,030
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

812
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,370
What a neat story.

813
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,406
Oh, with all this talk
about chopping off heads...

814
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,770
I wanna have a go.

815
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,286
What's this?

816
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,016
Oh...

817
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,886
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho...

818
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,286
Oh.

819
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,616
This is Harpy.

820
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,050
Hello, Harpy.

821
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,786
How are you?

822
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,396
Do you know what Harpy loves?

823
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,730
Having his head ripped off.

824
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,730
What? You liked it,
a second ago.

825
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,466
Alright.
Alright, alright.

826
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,760
Harpy's gone.

827
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,827
Come on.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

828
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:11,946
I'm scared.

829
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,120
Ah, look at you.

830
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,610
I knew a little girl,
just like you.

831
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,440
And she was brave.
And she was smart...

832
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,156
And funny.

833
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,320
And, she liked to draw.

834
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,090
Let me ask you a question...

835
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,106
About gods.

836
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,160
They're meant
to protect you, right?

837
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,106
Well, where are they?

838
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,086
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

839
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,510
Yes...

840
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,476
I'm counting on that.

841
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,640
That's why you're here.

842
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,906
It's invitation only, so we're gonna
have to keep a low profile and blend in.

843
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,780
Luckily, disguises are my speciality.

844
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,250
Greek philosopher.

845
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,476
I stole us these.

846
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,626
What are those?

847
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,360
Actual disguises.

848
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,570
They're the cloaks of
the emotion gods.

849
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,400
Every color signifies
a different emotion.

850
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,850
- Where are the emotion gods?
- Hm, don't ask.

851
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:18,474
Holy shit.

852
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,640
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

853
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,670
This is where the most powerful
created gods in the universe hang out.

854
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,650
That's the god of magic.

855
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,530
God of dreams.

856
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,526
God of carpentry.

857
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,140
Ah, look at that one.

858
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,276
Ah, yes.
That's Bao, god of dumplings.

859
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,056
- Psst. Hey, Bao.
- Bao!

860
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,406
Look up there, guys!

861
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,776
That's the Kronan god,
Ninny of the Nonny.

862
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,260
Hey, Ninny Nonny.

863
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:11,660
Zeus!

864
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,256
Hey!

865
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,020
I am Zeus!

866
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,160
Yes, yes.

867
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,680
Oh, there he is.

868
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,810
The man, the myth, the legend.

869
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,370
Oh, I don't know if you know this,
but I base a lot of what I do on this guy.

870
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,836
He's the god of lightning, I'm the god
of thunder. Huge source of inspiration.

871
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,636
That's really good.

872
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,560
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

873
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,050
Um, how do we get up there?

874
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,450
We just, like, fly?

875
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,086
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

876
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,810
He's famous for his entrances.

877
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,896
Thunderbolt.

878
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,530
- Thunderbolt.
- Yes!

879
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,350
Zeus!

880
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,220
Now, then.

881
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,290
Now, then.

882
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,530
Silence!

883
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,140
I hereby open

884
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,440
this holy council of the god.

885
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,186
Where we have many,
many serious matter...

886
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,926
To be talk about.

887
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:51,980
Such as...

888
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,130
Where are we going to
hold this year's orgy?

889
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,296
Is this guy for real?

890
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,666
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

891
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,720
- I'm sure he has a point, okay?
- Shh!

892
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,056
- So now we're going to announce...
- Sorry.

893
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:08,676
The winner of the most human souls
sacrificed in the name of a god.

894
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,176
Yeah, okay.
Maybe, he's not that great.

895
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,516
Oh, no, not good.

896
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,496
No, I don't think it's going
to get any better than this.

897
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,046
Look, these gods aren't going to help.

898
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,816
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be of use.

899
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,820
Judges!

900
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,990
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

901
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,326
We bum-rush him,
take the bolt, ding dong.

902
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,626
- All right, let's go get it.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

903
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,420
There's no ding-donging
or bum-rushing.

904
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,110
Especially not, Zeus's bum.

905
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,896
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

906
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,796
Time is right now.

907
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,400
- Time is not right now.
- Who is talking?

908
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,636
Who is talking?!

909
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,220
- These guys!
- Korg, shut up.

910
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,956
Do you have something
to say to the group?

911
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,140
Sorry.

912
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,976
I'm bashing heads in
60 seconds, so speak fast.

913
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,240
Literally, heads will roll.

914
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,470
Who are you two?

915
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,180
Hello!

916
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,516
Uh, let me be the first to say
it is an honor and a privilege...

917
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,886
- No, I can't hear you.
- To be here.

918
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,730
Why don't you take the stage?

919
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,390
The stage, down there?

920
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,750
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

921
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,340
Gotcha.

922
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,740
Coming through.

923
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:13,536
Oops, sorry.

924
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,890
Good luck, bro!

925
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,900
Mighty Zeus!
Heh, wow!

926
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,416
Gods of the universe.

927
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,480
I come here to ask for your help,
to raise an army.

928
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,366
There's a maniac, called the God
Butcher, who seeks to end us all.

929
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,596
His destruction is everywhere.

930
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,856
Entire planets, realms, have
been left completely unprotected.

931
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,206
He's left nothing but
chaos in his wake.

932
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,730
But I know where he is.

933
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,070
And with your help...

934
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,440
We can crush him before
he kills anyone else.

935
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,820
That guy.

936
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,946
He killed a couple
of low-level god.

937
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,420
Eh, boo-hoo.

938
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,076
If that's all, pretty boy...

939
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,896
You go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

940
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,056
Um, yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not
hear any of what I just said?

941
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,250
He's, he's murdering en masse.

942
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,450
I tell you, one time.

943
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,626
Now, you tart up.

944
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:09,666
You be quiet.

945
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,720
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

946
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,116
Zeus!
We must do something.

947
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,036
You can not come to the orgy!

948
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,520
You have to listen to us.

949
00:58:18,544 --> 00:58:18,976
Get thee.

950
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,200
Shazam!

951
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,376
Your highness. Whenever
you're ready, you just tell me.

952
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,716
We go on my signal.

953
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,736
What is the signal?

954
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,300
- It'll be go.
- Hmm...

955
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,120
Let's see who you are.

956
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,770
I take off your disguise.

957
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,090
And flick!

958
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,650
You flicked too hard, damn it!

959
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,830
Should we help him?

960
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,700
Eventually.

961
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,300
Grape?

962
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,956
Hmm, looks like a shy courgette.

963
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,750
And what about the others?

964
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,757
- We take off their disguise too.
- Oh, no, don't, don't flick us.

965
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:01,786
It's cool.

966
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,436
- Disguise gone.
- Disguise off. Cool?

967
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,190
Asgardians...

968
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,120
I thought we'd seen the
last of you when Odin died.

969
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,760
You...
are Thor.

970
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,990
The God of Thunder.

971
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,560
But is not thunder,

972
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,410
Just the sound of lightning?

973
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,800
Good one, dad!

974
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,636
Zeus, this is bigger than this.

975
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,636
He's taken Asgardian children.

976
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,830
Who do you think we are?

977
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,676
The God police?

978
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,080
Every god watches
over their own peoples.

979
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,746
Nothing more, nothing less.

980
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,416
Asgardian problems

981
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,186
are Asgardian problems.

982
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,390
How the mighty have fallen.

983
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,990
My hero, Zeus...

984
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,560
Afraid.

985
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,400
Couple of thing...

986
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,446
One.
Yes, I am scared.

987
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,946
Gorr has the Necrosword.

988
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,610
Which means, he could kill us.

989
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,457
Not good.

990
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,296
Two, I know you try
to do the right thing.

991
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,346
I understand.

992
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,146
But all you do,
is causing panic.

993
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,156
Panic is not good.

994
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,716
We are safe here.

995
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,086
You, my friend.

996
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,696
You are safe here.

997
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,736
So chill, baby cake?

998
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,260
Have some wine. Have some grape.

999
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,136
Anything goes here...

1000
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,660
In Omnipotent City.
Hmm?

1001
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,840
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

1002
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:38,270
If we are done,
I put your clothes back on.

1003
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,816
Now, I put your clothes back on.

1004
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,900
Flick, flick. Now,
this is the Golden Temple of the Gods.

1005
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,526
It's not a rude-y, nude-y festival.

1006
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,350
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least let us use your weapon.

1007
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,700
We need your lightning bolt.

1008
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,296
My lightning bolt is
called Thunderbolt.

1009
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,530
So I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this...

1010
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,766
That you should, at least, get
the name right when you ask.

1011
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,680
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1012
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:04,860
Thunderbolt!

1013
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,180
No.

1014
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,306
Do not worry.

1015
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,530
The God Butcher...

1016
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,900
He will not reach Eternity.

1017
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:44,930
Eternity?

1018
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,040
What does he mean,
"reach Eternity"?

1019
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,950
Oh, shit!

1020
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,056
Eternity,

1021
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,750
is a very powerful being at
the center of the universe,

1022
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,296
who will grant the desire of
the first person who reaches it.

1023
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,820
So it's like a wishing well?

1024
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,996
What do you think a guy called
the God Butcher would wish for?

1025
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,266
If he seeks the altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1026
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,310
- Zeus, we must act now.
- He's not going to make it.

1027
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,776
He doesn't have the key.

1028
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,680
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1029
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,516
To hide away in a
golden palace, like cowards?

1030
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,616
Maybe we have lost our way.

1031
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,706
You know what?
We'll stop him ourselves.

1032
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,810
I am afraid,
I cannot allow that.

1033
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,776
This is a secret place,

1034
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,860
known only to the gods.

1035
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,940
You know where we are...

1036
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,396
The God Butcher could use you...

1037
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,366
To find us.

1038
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,610
This is not good.

1039
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,830
So now...

1040
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,750
You must stay.

1041
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:49,970
Guards!

1042
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,446
Hey!

1043
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,646
Can we do my plan now?

1044
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,640
Yes, rush his bum.

1045
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,670
Hell, yeah!

1046
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,820
Oy, you didn't say "go".

1047
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,790
Coming, guys.

1048
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,730
Thor, catch!

1049
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:23,450
Korg!

1050
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,110
Val, duck!

1051
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,630
Korg!

1052
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,030
Thor.

1053
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,440
Oh, no.

1054
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:57,976
No!
Korg!

1055
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,216
Thor!

1056
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,680
I'm perishing.

1057
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Zeus!

1058
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,130
You're next, Odinson!

1059
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:21,100
That's the sound of lightning.

1060
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,130
No.

1061
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,000
Korgy?
Korgy!

1062
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,710
Thor, I'm down here.

1063
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,650
Wait! Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out, okay..

1064
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,720
- Here I am.
- Korgy!

1065
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,186
I didn't die.

1066
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,880
Yes!
You're alive!

1067
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,957
Turns out, the only part of
a Kronan that's alive is his mouth.

1068
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,826
Korgy, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1069
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,016
I'll do my best.

1070
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,206
- Guard him with your life.
- I will.

1071
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:51,230
Ready to go for a ride?

1072
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,620
Now, you got my six.

1073
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,030
Eight o'clock, Val.

1074
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,660
7:48!

1075
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,350
You can do this, damn it...

1076
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:04,816
That's not it.

1077
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,846
That's not it.

1078
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:06,930
Nope.

1079
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,310
Come on, Korg.
Purse those lips.

1080
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,550
I did it!

1081
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,596
And then the goat boat came in,
it rescued us, and we flew out the window.

1082
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,277
The end.

1083
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,476
Another classic Thor adventure.

1084
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,316
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1085
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,856
Well, you know what they say...

1086
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,270
Never meet your heroes.

1087
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,686
But what's important is, we are on
our way to you, right now.

1088
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,430
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1089
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,900
We're alright.
A little scared.

1090
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:24,396
Well, listen. I know what
it's like to be scared.

1091
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,266
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

1092
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,166
I don't think I would
have been as brave as you.

1093
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:28,997
Really?

1094
01:06:29,021 --> 01:06:32,100
In fact, you might just be the
bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1095
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,330
All of you.

1096
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,416
So I need you to keep
being brave, alright?

1097
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,630
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1098
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,250
Team kids in a cage.

1099
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,170
Can you do that?

1100
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,760
Yeah.
I think we can do that.

1101
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,440
I know you can.

1102
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,336
Alright?

1103
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,430
- Thor?
- Yeah?

1104
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,466
I'm glad I met my hero.

1105
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,790
Oh, thanks, buddy. Hmm.

1106
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,496
How are the children?

1107
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,536
As you can imagine, they're a
little bit scared because they're kids.

1108
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,596
But I told him that
everything is going to plan.

1109
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,556
Oh so you lied to them.

1110
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,666
You still have a plan?

1111
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,866
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1112
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,076
- There is a plan.
- No, there's no plan.

1113
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,376
We failed to raise a god army.

1114
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,766
- Korg is dead.
- He's not dead.

1115
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,526
- I'm not dead.
- Well, he's a head.

1116
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,870
And you, you got properly humilated.

1117
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,306
No, I got properly naked,
which I'm okay with.

1118
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,150
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1119
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,346
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1120
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:28,326
The point is we're going into the Shadow
Realm weaker than we were before. I mean...

1121
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,836
- We're gonna die.
- No one's gonna die.

1122
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,896
- We...
- Okay.

1123
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,750
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1124
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,156
- We killed Zeus.
- You killed Zeus.

1125
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,196
I mean, that may or may not
be catastrophic for the whole universe.

1126
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,016
And sure,

1127
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,866
The entire god kingdom is probably gonna
hunt us down for the rest of our days.

1128
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,706
But listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

1129
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,576
Alright, this is the army right here.

1130
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,900
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful.

1131
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,790
Well, for you, I love it.

1132
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,910
For you, Valkyrie.

1133
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,356
I mean, it's not
really what I'm into.

1134
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,506
Because I got my,
my weapon out there.

1135
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,400
Can I borrow that for a second?

1136
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,196
Ah!
There you are, old friend.

1137
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,550
That was quite
an entrance, back there.

1138
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,500
This and that.

1139
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,300
We good?

1140
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,370
Yeah?

1141
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,926
I mean, I know it's a little weird having
my ex-weapon around, but come on.

1142
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,960
MjÃ¶lnir, in the past.

1143
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,616
It's you and me now, buddy.

1144
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,640
You know what?

1145
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,686
I think it's time
for your first beer.

1146
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,710
What do you say?

1147
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,710
Delicious.

1148
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,720
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1149
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,710
Hey.

1150
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,430
Oh, hey.

1151
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,476
It's quite the...
view, huh?

1152
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,576
Yeah, beautiful.

1153
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,880
As I was saying, I was very, very
impressed with what you did back there.

1154
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,980
You and MjÃ¶lnir.
Y'know.

1155
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
Yeah.

1156
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,940
- In space, they have dolphins.
- What?

1157
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,726
There's...

1158
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,140
You should see
some space dolphins.

1159
01:09:12,385 --> 01:09:13,985
- Oh, wow.
- So, yeah.

1160
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,530
Beautiful.

1161
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,306
- Wow.
- They're so beautiful, so rare,

1162
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,850
And they're very loyal creatures.

1163
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,466
And they mate for life...

1164
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,900
In packs of 6.
Just, love.

1165
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:27,806
â« And a'hey little Nonny and
a fair Finny Fonny â«

1166
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,040
â« Oh, brother.
Man, you look so hot â«

1167
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,686
â« I wanna get in your rocks â«

1168
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:37,986
â« When we get together,
we're gonna get it on â«

1169
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,550
â« And I'm gonna make some babies â«

1170
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,260
That is the song that my dad sang to
my other dad when they were courting.

1171
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:49,396
When two Kronans want to make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain.

1172
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,306
And they go down to
a little lava pool.

1173
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,906
And they hold hands
over the hot lava.

1174
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,466
And then after a month,

1175
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,366
They pull their hands apart,

1176
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:58,336
and they find they've created a
beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1177
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,470
Oh, fascinating.
And hot.

1178
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,376
Did you ever have
a special someone?

1179
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,970
Oh, I've had,

1180
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,376
so many special someones.

1181
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,780
But, I don't know.

1182
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,916
I don't know if I want that again.

1183
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,856
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1184
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,636
And now, you're just trying to find
the answers in the bottom of a bottle.

1185
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:18,736
Or some meaningless dalliance,
which only serves to numb the pain.

1186
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,356
Instead of bringing you
real happiness or satisfaction.

1187
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,800
Yeah, something like that.

1188
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,136
They're beautiful.

1189
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,600
Beautiful thing.

1190
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,660
Jane.

1191
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,600
- Thor?
- I want to feel shitty about you.

1192
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,630
What?

1193
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,387
Well, you know, well...

1194
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:42,816
I...

1195
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,950
I want to feel shitty
about something.

1196
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,640
And I think that's you.

1197
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,456
- Not really getting any better.
- That's not it, dammit.

1198
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,796
I want, uh...

1199
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,340
My friend, he told me that
it was better to feel shitty

1200
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,576
from losing love than it is
to never experience love,

1201
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,920
and to feel nothing at all, and
feel empty and I think he was right.

1202
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,676
Which is how I've been
feeling for a long time.

1203
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,036
I push people away,
kept them at a distance

1204
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,406
because of the fear of that loss.

1205
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,546
But I don't want to do that anymore.
I don't wanna...

1206
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,776
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1207
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,317
That's what I did.

1208
01:11:11,341 --> 01:11:14,096
Yes, I closed off my
heart and, and I meditated.

1209
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,200
- Do, do you meditate?
- No, it's so boring.

1210
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,016
It actually made me more angry.

1211
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,286
But I'm tired of giving
myself over to the idea of fate

1212
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,790
and trying to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

1213
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,797
I want to live in the moment.

1214
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:26,396
I want to live like
there's no tomorrow.

1215
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,466
Throw caution to the wind.

1216
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,036
I want...
I want to be with you, Jane.

1217
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,566
What do you say?

1218
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,280
I have cancer.

1219
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,290
I'm sorry, what?

1220
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,426
I'm sick.

1221
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,006
- Wait, what is happening?
- Bye...

1222
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,716
- Uh...
- No, no, no, no.

1223
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,506
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

1224
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,876
- Wait, Jane.
- What did I say?

1225
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,926
I didn't mean that.

1226
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:46,946
Just kidding.

1227
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,336
I...

1228
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,300
don't have cancer.
Let's go smash something.

1229
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:53,826
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1230
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:57,396
Don't be sorry for me.

1231
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,426
When did you find out?

1232
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,990
Um...

1233
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,766
Like, six months ago.
I...

1234
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,056
I was just feeling tired.

1235
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,150
And then, they told
me I have stage four.

1236
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,670
Get my affairs in order.

1237
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,980
And then, I heard MjÃ¶lnir
calling me so...

1238
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,766
I thought, maybe...

1239
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,940
If science isn't working, maybe...

1240
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,720
Viking space magic.

1241
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,846
And that's why you came to New Asgard.

1242
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,900
Yeah, I thought the hammer

1243
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,930
maybe could cure me, and...

1244
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:27,254
I think it's getting better...

1245
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,110
Maybe not.

1246
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,796
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1247
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:34,996
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1248
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,620
And MjÃ¶lnir, MjÃ¶lnir chose you.

1249
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,236
And it chose you because
you are worthy.

1250
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,836
And that's something.

1251
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,346
When I first met you,
I was unworthy...

1252
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,370
I was unable to
pick up that hammer.

1253
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:51,230
But you taught me, there was no greater
purpose than to help those in need.

1254
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,490
You made me worthy.

1255
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,390
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1256
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:01,114
Okay.

1257
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:04,436
Now, what do you wanna do?

1258
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:07,126
I wanna get those
children back to their families.

1259
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,526
I want to finish that mission.

1260
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,070
Spoken like a true Thor.

1261
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,210
How do you feel now?

1262
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,400
So scared.

1263
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,206
How you feeling?

1264
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,430
Shitty.

1265
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,410
How shitty?

1266
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,570
Really shitty.

1267
01:13:22,594 --> 01:13:23,694
Well then.

1268
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,496
I wonder what those two
are talking about, out there.

1269
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,056
Yeah, they're not talking.

1270
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,466
Oh!

1271
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:43,340
Do you think those two will ever
hold hands over a hot lava pool

1272
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,130
and make a Thor baby?

1273
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:49,030
It's unlikely, sadly.

1274
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,836
Mm, that's too bad.

1275
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,670
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1276
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,310
Hey!
We're here.

1277
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:07,690
Where did all the color go?

1278
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,940
They're not here.

1279
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,590
Where are they?

1280
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,530
What the hell is this place?

1281
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,230
Bifrost is the key.

1282
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:50,530
It's a trap!

1283
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,366
Can you tell me why you just threw
Storm breaker out the window?

1284
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,590
He needs it to open the gates of Eternity.

1285
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:45,276
We really have to
stop meeting like this.

1286
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,506
Call the ax.

1287
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,256
I'll call the ax when
you call the dentist.

1288
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,920
Call the ax.

1289
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:53,400
Tell me where the children
are or I'm gonna kill...

1290
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,890
Call the ax.

1291
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:11,406
Some god you are.

1292
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,040
You know nothing

1293
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:15,330
of being a god.

1294
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,716
You went to the gods for help

1295
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,250
and they did nothing.

1296
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,550
We're alike, in that sense.

1297
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,186
He's nothing like you.

1298
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,710
What was that?

1299
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,510
I said, he's nothing like you.

1300
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,866
That's right.
I'm not a hypocrite.

1301
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,966
I'm truly creating peace.

1302
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:41,496
You're murdering innocent gods.

1303
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,730
Innocent?

1304
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,246
Are you a Valkyrie?

1305
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,506
Yes.

1306
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:48,930
Haha, how exciting.

1307
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,286
Oh, the gods failed you too.

1308
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:57,270
Your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1309
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,170
Did you pray to the gods...

1310
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,680
When the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1311
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,930
Did you beg them for help...

1312
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,070
As your family was massacred?

1313
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,410
Good chat.

1314
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,206
This one...

1315
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,940
You're interesting.

1316
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,400
You're different.

1317
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,980
Yes.

1318
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,960
Aww...

1319
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,010
You're dying.

1320
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,790
I'm sorry.

1321
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,720
We're on the same path.

1322
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,260
Just as the sword empowered me.

1323
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,920
The hammer empowered you.

1324
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,920
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1325
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,880
The gods will use you...

1326
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,430
But they will not help you.

1327
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,530
There is no

1328
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,260
eternal reward,

1329
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,060
for us.

1330
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,560
She'll be gone soon.

1331
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,936
And you know who won't help her?

1332
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,510
I'll give you one guess.

1333
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,246
I know your pain.

1334
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,480
Love is pain.

1335
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,980
I had a daughter once.

1336
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:49,150
I put my faith in a higher power,
hoping it would save her.

1337
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,490
And she

1338
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,170
died.

1339
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,476
Now I understand...

1340
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,440
My daughter is the lucky one.

1341
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,900
She does not have to grow up in a world...

1342
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:10,550
Of suffering and pain

1343
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:15,610
run by wicked gods.

1344
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,816
Choose love.

1345
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,020
Call the ax.

1346
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:36,560
Call the ax.

1347
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,170
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1348
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,716
Hmm, I want to kill this guy.

1349
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,416
So do I, but we have
to take him alive.

1350
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,350
He's our only link to
finding those children.

1351
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,060
Oh!
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1352
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,290
Val!

1353
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:25,870
We've gotta get her out of here.

1354
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,020
Hey, I got you.

1355
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,436
Hey guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1356
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,630
Storm breaker, take us home.

1357
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:52,880
Look, there are other, more aggressive
forms of treatment we can try,

1358
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,906
but something's affecting her
body's ability to fight the cancer.

1359
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,230
I'm sorry, Thor.

1360
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,566
Oh, there you are.

1361
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:15,606
What's going on out there?

1362
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,790
Oh, some moron made a fridge
without a door. Can you believe it?

1363
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,180
Not to worry, I got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1364
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:23,070
How's Val?

1365
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,666
Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

1366
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,030
Okay, good.

1367
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,946
Now, I just gotta get this

1368
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,510
- out of my...
- Woah! No, no, no.

1369
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,306
That's gotta stay in there.

1370
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:35,076
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1371
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,256
Just gonna pop out for a moment.

1372
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,876
Pick up the kids.
Uh, kill a bad guy.

1373
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,316
And then, I'll come straight back.

1374
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,440
You're going without me?

1375
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,710
Uh, yeah.

1376
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,740
What happened to like...
doing everything together?

1377
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,056
He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

1378
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:48,827
You need me.

1379
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:50,106
I do need you, Jane.

1380
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:51,340
I need you alive.

1381
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,166
It would be great to have
you on the battlefield.

1382
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:54,650
Fighting Gorr side by side,

1383
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,590
but that hammer is killing you.

1384
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:00,936
Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength,

1385
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,280
leaving your body unable
to fight the cancer.

1386
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:06,306
What happened to live
like there's no tomorrow?

1387
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:08,306
That was before I knew
you might not have one.

1388
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,656
Why not have one more adventure?

1389
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,776
Jane, if there's a chance to live.
You have to take it.

1390
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,890
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1391
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,500
I know, I seem like some cool
astrophysicist from New Mexico.

1392
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:23,427
Just living the dream.

1393
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:25,426
But, look at me.

1394
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,126
I wanna keep fighting.

1395
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,926
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1396
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,196
And you want me not to do that?

1397
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,730
What's the point of
more time, and this?

1398
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,490
Because I love you.

1399
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,860
I've always loved you.

1400
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:43,716
And this is a chance, for us.

1401
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,990
If you pick up that damn hammer
again, then that chance is gone.

1402
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,480
It's your choice, Jane.

1403
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,636
But I'd regret it
every single day,

1404
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,980
If I didn't ask you to stay here, so we
can try and figure this out together.

1405
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,906
You better come back to me.

1406
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:15,410
I'm coming back,
as soon as I can.

1407
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,456
Break a leg.

1408
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,020
Oh, I'll break all his legs.

1409
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,960
Remember that, the gate
to Eternity is at the literal center

1410
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,676
- of the universe...
- Universe.

1411
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,996
- You go past the cluster of comets...
- Yes.

1412
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,336
Yes, yes. I know.
We've been over this.

1413
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,076
I'm not going to get lost.

1414
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,476
So how are you feeling
with the old stab wound?

1415
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,240
- I think I lost my kidney.
- Gone? Completely? Ugh.

1416
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:48,156
I wish I could join you, but...

1417
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:50,340
I'd probably die and that
won't help get the kids back.

1418
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:52,226
So you'll have to go it alone.

1419
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,980
All you have to do,
is destroy that sword.

1420
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,416
It's his source of power.

1421
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,960
He won't survive
long without it.

1422
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,996
Hey, don't die.

1423
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,160
Yeah, I know.

1424
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,240
Eternity.

1425
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,000
Finally.

1426
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:45,940
Hey, kids.

1427
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:49,660
I knew he'd come.

1428
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,385
Go.

1429
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:53,110
Go, kids.

1430
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,700
Everyone okay?

1431
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,646
Alright, gather round.
Gather round.

1432
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,280
Good to see you
in person, buddy.

1433
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,510
Good to see you.

1434
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:19,730
Alright, listen up!
Here's the plan.

1435
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,026
We're gonna sneak our
way towards Storm breaker,

1436
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:26,060
Being very careful not to bump into,
any of those big shadow monsters.

1437
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,090
They're behind me, aren't they?

1438
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,330
Does anyone here
have battle experience?

1439
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,320
Well, no time to
learn like the present.

1440
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:40,880
But, we're not strong like you.

1441
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:41,700
We're just kids.

1442
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,116
Hey, don't forget.
You're Asgardian kids.

1443
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:44,857
I'm not.

1444
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:48,156
- I'm just a Lieckning kid.
- And I'm a Mardasian kid.

1445
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,286
Okay.
Okay.

1446
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,726
But today, you're Asgardians.

1447
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,156
Now, collect your weapons.

1448
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,196
What?

1449
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,296
Go and find anything
you can pick up.

1450
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,646
And bring it back here.

1451
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:59,030
Hurry, hurry.

1452
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,786
Okay, go, c'mon.

1453
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,760
They're getting closer,
hurry up.

1454
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,790
Today, is a day that
will go down in history.

1455
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:14,340
Today's a day they will talk
about for generations to come.

1456
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:17,380
Today, we are Space Vikings!

1457
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,740
Present...
arms!

1458
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:26,346
Whosoever holds these weapons,

1459
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:28,876
And believes in getting home,
if they be true of heart,

1460
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,730
Is therefore,
worthy, and shall possess...

1461
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,946
For a limited time only,

1462
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:38,740
The power of Thor!

1463
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,290
General Axl...

1464
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,480
Lead your army to that ax.

1465
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,450
We shall do our worst...

1466
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,800
For Asgard.

1467
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,960
Jane.

1468
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,030
We destroy that sword
and he's dead.

1469
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,880
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Storm breaker.

1470
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,790
It's okay.
I got him.

1471
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,410
Storm breaker, stop this!

1472
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,216
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing.

1473
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,650
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1474
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,600
Come on!

1475
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,830
Let go of my friend!

1476
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,480
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1477
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,916
First off,

1478
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,420
the name is Mighty Thor.

1479
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,760
And secondly...

1480
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:25,656
If you can't say Mighty Thor,

1481
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:29,750
I'll accept Dr. Jane Foster!

1482
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,360
And thirdly,

1483
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:37,410
eat my hammer!

1484
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,580
Storm breaker!

1485
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,490
I knew you could do it.

1486
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:57,620
Axl!
Get them home.

1487
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,130
Jane?

1488
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:48,620
I'm okay.

1489
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,820
You have to stop him.

1490
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,410
Gorr, stop!

1491
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:30,780
What kind of father
would I be, if I stopped.

1492
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,560
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1493
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,100
It's not death
or revenge that you seek.

1494
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
What do I seek?

1495
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:02,880
You seek love.

1496
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,070
Love?

1497
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:11,130
Why should I seek love?

1498
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,380
Because that's all
any of us want.

1499
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:22,016
How dare you turn
your back on me.

1500
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,950
You've won, Gorr.

1501
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:27,380
Why would I spend my last moments
with you, when I can be with her?

1502
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:30,386
I choose love.

1503
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:32,620
You can, too.
You can bring her back.

1504
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,740
Make your wish.

1505
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:11,210
I'm dying.

1506
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,280
She would have no one.

1507
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,280
She would be alone.

1508
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,360
She won't be alone.

1509
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,380
My love.

1510
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,950
I've missed you, so much.

1511
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:55,330
I've missed you, too.

1512
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,080
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1513
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,730
Ever since I picked up that hammer...

1514
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:11,280
It's like...
I've gotten an extra life.

1515
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,850
It was...

1516
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,230
Magical.

1517
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,390
Not too bad for a human.

1518
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,990
Not too bad for a god.

1519
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:30,490
I think I figured
out my catchphrase.

1520
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,660
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Look...

1521
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,650
It's perfect.

1522
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,420
- It's the best one yet.
- Thanks.

1523
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:52,700
Keep your heart open.

1524
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,060
I love you.

1525
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,280
I love you too.

1526
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:49,670
Protect her.

1527
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:52,150
Protect my love.

1528
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:29,030
Let me tell you the
legend of the Space Viking.

1529
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,660
A.K.A

1530
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,446
"The Mighty Thor".

1531
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,830
A.K.A

1532
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:36,100
"Dr. Jane Foster".

1533
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:43,880
Her sacrifice saved the universe and
taught us all what it means to be worthy.

1534
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:47,066
She helped the
children of the gods.

1535
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:49,330
Who laser beamed
their way back home,

1536
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:53,760
to their dozy, little fishing
village turned tourist destination.

1537
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:55,880
Mommy!

1538
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:57,550
Look at you!

1539
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,866
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1540
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,180
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1541
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:02,980
The kids were safe to be kids again.

1542
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:05,700
Widen your stance.

1543
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:09,820
Especially after their king made
them all go to self-defense classes.

1544
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:12,900
- Look at all those budding Space Vikings.
- And the most important part.

1545
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:15,900
The war cry!

1546
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:17,506
Even Heimdall's son.

1547
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,950
Axl Heimdall son

1548
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,536
who could now do his
dad's freaky eye magic,

1549
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:23,706
was becoming quite the warrior.

1550
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:26,100
The future of Asgard was secure.

1551
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,506
Speaking of futures,

1552
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,206
I was forging one of my own.

1553
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:32,656
Now, that my body
has grown back.

1554
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:35,170
With a dude I met called Dwayne.

1555
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,720
And what about Thor, you ask?

1556
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:41,586
He embarked on a new journey.

1557
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:44,086
Because he had found something to live for.

1558
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:46,100
Something to love for.

1559
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:49,260
A little someone who
turned him from sad god

1560
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:50,696
into dad god.

1561
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,520
Breakfast is served, bon appetit.

1562
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,496
Hello!

1563
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:55,586
There you go!

1564
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:57,866
Hey!
Breakfast!

1565
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:58,990
Excuse me.

1566
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:00,776
What is that?

1567
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,616
They're...
They're panflaps from Earth.

1568
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,606
I don't think I like panflaps.

1569
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:05,766
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1570
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:07,786
- Yes, you do.
- Never had that in my life.

1571
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:09,816
Come on, eat up.
We have to go. We're gonna be late.

1572
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,600
- Now, where are your boots?
- I'm wearing them.

1573
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,416
You're not wearing those.

1574
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,146
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1575
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:18,576
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1576
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,490
Go to hell, demon!

1577
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:24,360
It's brand new.
Now, destroyed.

1578
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:26,066
Thank you very much.

1579
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:27,996
You know what, you wear what you want.

1580
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,646
Don't come complaining to
me when your feet get sore.

1581
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,770
Alright, you get no
sympathy here from me.

1582
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,436
Ugh, fine.
I'll wear the boots.

1583
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:35,107
Thank you.

1584
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:37,326
Now, remember what
my mother used to tell me.

1585
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,406
Listen to the grown ups.

1586
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,606
And if you see anyone
scared or being picked on,

1587
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,046
- Look after them. Okay?
- Okay.

1588
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,660
And most of all, have fun.

1589
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:45,230
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1590
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,426
Now, where is MjÃ¶lnir?
Where did I put it?

1591
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:48,890
Over there, sleeping in the bed.

1592
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,980
In the bed.

1593
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:52,910
Oh, wow!

1594
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:57,646
That is not coming off.

1595
01:46:57,670 --> 01:46:58,990
What did you do?

1596
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:01,200
Eh, she looked boring before.

1597
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:03,120
Ah!

1598
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:03,950
Supposed it did.

1599
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:04,980
I love it.

1600
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:06,420
Very creative.

1601
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,220
Okay...

1602
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:15,036
Now, see the aliens down there?
The stripy ones?

1603
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:15,866
They look nice.

1604
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:16,737
Yeah, they are nice.

1605
01:47:16,761 --> 01:47:17,856
That's why we have
to look after them.

1606
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,796
Got it.

1607
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:20,280
Protect the nice ones.

1608
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:22,020
I love you, sweetie.

1609
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,320
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1610
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:27,720
They will always be there for us.

1611
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,096
The Space Viking, and his girl born from
Eternity

1612
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,720
with the powers of a god.

1613
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,320
Two warriors, fighting the good fight, for
those who can't fight good.

1614
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,820
They have traveled far, and have been
given many names.

1615
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,920
But to those who know them best,
they're simply known as.

1616
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,120
Love and Thunder.

1617
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:49,720
It used to be that being
a god, meant something.

1618
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:53,636
People would whisper your name...

1619
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:56,930
Before sharing their
deepest hopes and dreams.

1620
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:01,476
They begged you for mercy...

1621
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:06,670
Without ever knowing, if
you're actually listening.

1622
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,700
Now...

1623
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,056
You know, they look to the sky.

1624
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,986
They don't ask us for lightning.

1625
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:17,066
They don't ask us for rain.

1626
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:21,380
They just want to see one of
their so-called superheroes.

1627
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:26,890
When did we become the joke?

1628
01:50:30,214 --> 01:50:32,214
No.

1629
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:34,238
No more.

1630
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:38,230
They will fear us again...

1631
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:41,490
When Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1632
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:48,030
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1633
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,370
- Do you understand, my son?
- Yes, father.

1634
01:57:32,513 --> 01:57:33,513
Oh!

1635
01:57:33,537 --> 01:57:36,037
Huh? Oh.

1636
01:57:37,161 --> 01:57:39,661
Huh. Ha ha ha.

1637
01:57:40,988 --> 01:57:43,088
Oh, hey!

1638
01:57:44,279 --> 01:57:45,979
Jane Foster.

1639
01:57:46,971 --> 01:57:48,671
Heimdall.

1640
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:50,551
I see you're dead now.

1641
01:57:50,713 --> 01:57:52,605
Uh. Yeah.

1642
01:57:52,629 --> 01:57:54,962
Thank you for looking after my son.

1643
01:57:55,004 --> 01:57:58,140
You are very welcome here to
the land of the gods.

1644
01:58:02,746 --> 01:58:04,846
Welcome to Valhalla.
