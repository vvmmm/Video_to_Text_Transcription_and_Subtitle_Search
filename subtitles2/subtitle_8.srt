The mystery
of Tansen's tanpura begins with...

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,920
the curse of the rudrabina?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,119
"Sarod, sitar, flute,
santoor, shehnai...

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,200
sarangi, rudrabina."

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
Nawab Amanat Khan
had gifted each of us a disc.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,080
Is this a clue to finding
Tansen's Raga Sanjivani?

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,439
Your singing and your work
has impressed us, Naad.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,200
Your singing is full of mystery.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,040
But it's lifeless.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,280
You have to atone for the sins
of your ancestors, Naad.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
Will you accept me as your student?

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Of course.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,160
Do you still have your disc?

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,359
"In the heart of Rudrapur
lies a Shiva lake

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,240
When the discs are aligned

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,279
And the notes are played
at twice the pace of time

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,800
Raga Sanjivani you shall find."

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,840
Was Salamat Uncle
Madanti's descendant?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
You're hiding something
this time too.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,880
Mom!
Can you hear me?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Mom!

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,880
Tell me, Bahadur.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,719
Were Salamat and Noor...

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,840
murdered?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
No matter what it takes...

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,480
I will unravel this mystery.

You...

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,080
You're Noor's father, Bahadur?

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,680
And all these years...

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
you kept it a secret?

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,600
Lolit.

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,600
You and Saaz should leave.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,720
Dangerous...

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,720
They are dangerous.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,080
- What if something happens to you...
- What will happen?

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,880
What do I have to lose?

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,440
Take Saaz and go away from here.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,200
Bahadur.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Stay with us for a few days.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,759
It's not safe for you
to stay alone.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,040
You don't have to worry
about me.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Won't spare them.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,240
I won't spare anyone.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,640
- Bahadur.
- Lolit...

PART 2

48
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Hey, where's everyone?

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,440
- Upstairs.
- Oh.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
- All good?
- Yes.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Good morning.

52
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,480
Wow!

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Everyone is here, huh.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,880
You?

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Why are you here?

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
To do my duty as a friend.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,640
Lolit might not consider me his friend...

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
but I consider him a friend.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,760
How can I not stand by him
in times of need?

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,200
Your skin should be displayed
in the museum

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,720
for rhinos and chameleons to see.

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,840
Hmm.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Everyone changes colour,
Pandit Ranjan Ghosh.

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,480
You defamed me.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,560
That's how you got the National Music Award
meant for me.

66
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,720
- Now I know...
- Stop talking nonsense, Hemanta.

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
You?

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,880
- You're a disgrace to Anandagarh.
- Hmm.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,680
There's just one problem.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,040
You couldn't prove it in court.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,760
You needed a better plan
to frame me.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
- Hemanta.
- Yes?

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm really not in the mood.

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,120
- Please leave.
- Right.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,120
Lolit, I know this was a big loss for you.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,400
But you can't break down, my friend.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,480
Hemanta, whatever I might be...

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm not a scoundrel like you.

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Hmm.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,280
So, I don't need your consolation.

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
Leave.

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,320
You still misunderstand me
for that characterless woman?

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,560
Hey, cut the crap.

84
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,280
Why aren't you throwing him out, Dad?

85
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Hemanta, go away!

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,880
Just leave.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,919
I better not see you here again.

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,960
My goodness!

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
So, everyone's out to insult me.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Fine.

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll leave if you want me to.

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,640
All of you wronged Rohini.

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
But all the blame's on me now?

94
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Good.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
Great!

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Just a minute.

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,560
Nawab Amanat Khan had given you
a disc

98
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,199
at your naming ceremony.
Do you have it?

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,480
Yes.

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
Why?

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,680
Can I take a look at it?

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,400
Just a look?

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,999
You can keep it.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,520
I don't need it anymore.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
Alap...

106
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,440
who do I have but you?

107
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,240
How can I get the disc?

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
It's in my bag right now.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Come with me.

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
He's carrying it with him!

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,200
Well, look at that.

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,440
You need my help, after all.

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Hmm?

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,320
Come.

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,080
I always carry this with me.

116
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,320
It's a gift from the great guru,
after all.

117
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
Here you go.

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,760
Someone who can sell
his lover for money...

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440
can never value a precious gift.
I don't buy it.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,320
If you harm my mother again

121
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,160
no one will be able to save you
from me.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hmmph!

123
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,480
(inaudible)

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,680
Good morning, Alap.

125
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,400
Hope you recognise me.

126
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the Rudrabhairav.

127
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,520
How long will it take?

128
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
Um...

129
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll do it.

130
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll fix up a date.

131
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
Don't worry.

132
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Confirm the show.

133
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes.

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
The job will be done.

135
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Okay.

136
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
Show? You're managing shows?

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,160
Hey, why are you lying?
I've been noticing you.

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,976
- I'm not...
- You haven't even been practising.

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,319
Don't avoid me.
Why are you lying?

140
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Wait.

141
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
Turn off the lights.

142
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
The guards are not there.

143
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
- Come with me.
- Okay.

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Come along.

145
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Let's go.
Have you checked properly?

146
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,880
Wait.

147
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
Let me go first.

148
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
- Let's go.
- Come.

149
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,880
This way.

150
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Hurry up.

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,120
This way.
Fast.

152
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,400
Where are you going?

153
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Don't you dare try this again, Rohini.

154
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
Don't forget, your son's life
is in my hands.

155
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,240
Take her back.

156
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,160
- Come on!
- Come.

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,440
- Come.
- Let me go.

158
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,040
- Come on!
- Moti! Moti!

159
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,880
Hey, let me go!

160
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,520
Why are you here, Gopal?

161
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,160
Naad has returned to Anandagarh.
Why are you still here?

162
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
I was on my way.

163
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,440
I came here because of the ruckus.

164
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
Leave!

165
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,200
And keep a close eye on Naad.

166
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
- Go.
- Okay.

167
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,600
Who's putting these ideas
in your head, Moti?

168
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Answer me.

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,880
No, it's just that...

170
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,520
She was in pain so...

171
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,040
How dare you?

172
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,400
Who should I punish for this?

173
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,520
You or your son?

174
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,280
Hmm?

175
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Moti?

176
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Punish me.

177
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,800
Hmm.

178
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,920
Alap.

179
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,960
- Hey.
- Hmm?

180
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,760
What's this?

181
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
Didn't sleep at all, did you?

182
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
I just can't crack this notation.

183
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
Even the rare books in your library
couldn't give me a hint.

184
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,520
What do I do now, Shruti?

185
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,680
I know you very well, Alap.

186
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,520
Tell me what's...

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
You evaded my questions yesterday too.

188
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,400
What are you hiding?

189
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,120
And...

190
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
stop avoiding me.

191
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Has something happened
to Rohini Aunty?

192
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,240
Hey, why are you crying?

193
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,520
Alap?

194
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,120
Tell me what happened.

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,720
Is Rohini Aunty alright?

196
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Hey...

197
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,520
What...

198
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
Moti.

199
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
W... Where's Moti?

200
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,360
Tell me.

201
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Where's Moti?

202
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,560
Hey!

203
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,200
Wait!

204
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,000
Listen to me!

205
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,320
Moti...

206
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,960
How could you not tell me
something like this?

207
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,920
You could've at least told me
that Rohini Aunty is in danger.

208
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,880
Don't you trust me at all?

209
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Mom will be fine, right, Shruti?

210
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
She'll be fine.

211
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
Nothing will happen to her.

212
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,760
We'll crack the notation together.

213
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,960
Hey...

214
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,720
can't we try searching
Grandpa's farmhouse?

215
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,320
Dad was saying
there might be rare books.

216
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
We might find something.

217
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I can get the keys
if you want me to.

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Okay.

219
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,560
Let's go.

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,120
Shruti.

221
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,360
- Don't tell anyone about Mom, please.
- I'll tell everyone.

222
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,760
Obviously I won't.
Come on.

223
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,360
This way.

224
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh, sorry.
I can barely see anything.

225
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,720
- Shruti.
- Hmm?

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
There's nothing much here.

227
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,000
There's another room.

228
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
- Ouch!
- Hey! Careful.

229
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
A rudrabina.

230
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,920
Did your Grandpa teach
how to play the rudrabina?

231
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,560
I've never heard anything like that.

232
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,840
HAIL GODDESS SARASWATI

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Mom's handwriting...

234
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
(inaudible)

235
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
What are you thinking about?
Look what I found.

236
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
There's a pen in the box.

237
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,320
See, it looks so strange.

238
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,120
Wait.
I didn't notice that.

239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Hey.

240
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,760
Isn't it the same symbol?

241
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Yes, looks like it.

242
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,080
What does it have to do
with my grandpa?

243
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,360
Only one person can answer that.

243
00:21:45,305 --> 00:22:45,387
