ï»¿1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,462
Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,940
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,408
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,605
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,114
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,617
Lockup! Lockup!

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,619
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,554
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,285
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,294
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,920
Bastards.

12
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,966
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,758
I'm gonna kill him.

14
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,497
I'm gonna kill him!

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,630
âª Three little maids
from school âª

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,729
Aah!
Shit.

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,741
You need to keep to small steps,
Roddy.

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,553
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring gear in here.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,068
I'm going out.
I am due for release.

20
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,478
No, you're not, Mr. Snooper.

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,143
- Take him back to the cell.
- But she's not pressing charges.

22
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,549
You can't keep me here!

23
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,017
Yes!

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,116
Oh, look at his little
fingernails.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,654
Hello, Kevin.

26
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,031
- Aah!
- No!

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,730
You big pillock, Tully!

28
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,036
I'll take the lot of you on!
Come on!

29
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,319
He's obviously been
given a very severe beating.

30
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,954
He should <i>never</i>
have been accepted

31
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,538
back to Barfield
in this condition.

32
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,282
Tray collection!

33
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,788
Don't say a word.

34
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,121
That bugger Bradshaw
stitched us up.

35
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,887
Fifty quid
that Tarzan won't last

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,088
more than 24 hours on my wing.

37
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,758
Well, let's see if we can cope
with him for 48.

38
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,061
We'll clean up.

39
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,658
Ah, but we're still lumbered.

40
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,169
Where's he gonna go?

41
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,569
Number 4.
It's ready for him.

42
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,732
Morning, Mr. Tarzan.

43
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,571
I'm your wing governor,
Mr. Syons.

44
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,575
Officer Jackson.

45
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,736
Thank you very much.

46
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,838
Get your kit sorted.
It's lockup till 10:30.

47
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,578
Oh, sir, will I be allowed
on the wing for association?

48
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,780
You're no different than anyone
else on this wing, Tarzan.

49
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,122
Want to bet?

50
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,318
I see the musical's back on,
then.

51
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,621
Governor's orders.

52
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,888
Okay, Tarzan.

53
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,539
What's that about a musical?

54
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,563
I can sing, you know.

55
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,860
He's all yours, mate.

56
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:12,932
- Cheers.
- See you.

57
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,028
âª Holy, Holy, Holy âª

58
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:21,041
âª Lord God Almighty âª

59
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,408
So Officer Hully then said that
he would bring in balaclavas?

60
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,002
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,656
Officer Jason Hully said
he'd bring them in

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,615
and he'd leave
Keith Smith's cell door open

63
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,126
so we could go in there
and beat him up.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,661
But since then,
has he reapproached you

65
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,096
or discussed it further
with you both?

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,019
Yeah, he did.

67
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:34,952
- No, he didn't.
- No. No, he never.

68
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,366
No, 'cause we haven't
encouraged him.

69
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,019
We wanted to speak
to the authorities first

70
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,459
'cause we know our word
against the screws don't count.

71
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,872
Well, that's exactly what it is,
isn't it?

72
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,865
- Yes, ma'am. I know that.
- Yeah, we know this.

73
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,059
That's why we're here
and we're prepared to prove it.

74
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,734
What we want to do is tape
his next visit

75
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,761
so we've got proof
and you've got proof.

76
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,567
Simple. Understand?

77
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,574
Thank you, Mr. Buffy,
Mr. Samora.

78
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,439
- Let's go.
- Right, mate.

79
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,315
No one's spoken to the officer
in question?

80
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,910
Not so far as I know.

81
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,387
Then tape him.

82
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,751
Stand up and behave.
The governor's here.

83
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,088
I'm very sorry to hear
about Ms. Bullock.

84
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,656
Yes.
We all are.

85
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,734
Uh, you've requested
a visiting order for Ms. Purvis?

86
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,899
Yes, Ms. Hewitt,
and I have this to show you.

87
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,142
It's a letter from Ms. Purvis.

88
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,542
She says she wants to see me.

89
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,547
She knows
what I'm in Barfield for.

90
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,083
Said it didn't make
any difference.

91
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,619
Finish cleaning your cell.

92
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,526
Have a nice visit, Mr. Samuels.

93
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,929
Thank you very much.

94
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,128
Well, he's back!

95
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,497
About time, you skiving bugger.
Come on. Come here.

96
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,474
- Oh, wow.
- Good to see you.

97
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,850
So pretty boy has dared

98
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,408
to step out of his cell
this morning.

99
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,920
Well, well.

100
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,252
You've been keeping yourself
to yourself, haven't you?

101
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,792
With scum like you,
best way to be.

102
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,088
Hark the rapist.

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Hey! I ain't no rapist
for you, right?

104
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,264
You twisted pervert.

105
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,822
Dirty likkle nonce, you.

106
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,834
Now, now.
You'll upset my friends.

107
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,130
Oh, yeah?

108
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,831
And they'll cut me up
and eat out my balls, right?

109
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,840
You don't frighten me, you know.

110
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,705
You disgust me.

111
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,677
- Morning, Vernon.
- Hey, Jumbo.

112
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,304
Is the, uh, barber working
this morning?

113
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,338
- Barber!
- What?

114
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,145
Come on, now, you two.

115
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,650
Governor's on her rounds
any second.

116
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,414
Will you do me a quick one?

117
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,284
I told you to make
an appointment.

118
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,551
I've got a bleach, a streak,
and a blow job.

119
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,525
- How long are you gonna be?
- Hours.

120
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,958
I've only got a short break.

121
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,307
I've got to get back
on the wing.

122
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,202
Yeah. Well, I can hardly leave
him here, can I?

123
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,424
Good morning.

124
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,302
I'll like to see Mr. Snooper
in the probation office, please.

125
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,506
Morning.

126
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,504
Mr. Jackson.

127
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,479
You've not been transferred
to the VP Wing.

128
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,658
No, Ms. Hewitt.
It's my break.

129
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,913
And, uh, I've just come to get
a quick trim.

130
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,384
Really?

131
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,385
Morning, Barber.

132
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,513
Good morning, Ms. Hewitt.

133
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,887
Now, you've asked for...

134
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,653
Glue.
I need some more.

135
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,024
And if possible,
a new set of these.

136
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,027
They're me only pair,

137
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,087
and I'm having to cut
cardboard up with them.

138
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,395
I'm making these
for "The Mikado,"

139
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,992
and I'm attaching pigtails
down the back for the chorus.

140
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,038
But you had glue two days ago.

141
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,104
I know.
I know.

142
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,663
But I've told him.

143
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,834
It's been whipped
soon as I get the cap off.

144
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,003
I need that white stuff.
You can't sniff that.

145
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:49,277
But I'm blunting me scissors,
and they <i>are</i> an expensive item.

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,993
I'll have a word
with the education department.

147
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,077
Thank you very much, Ms. Hewitt,

148
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,282
and may I say you've had
a very nice cut.

149
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,551
Thank you.

150
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,024
Could do better meself.

151
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:03,257
I need them rollers back,
Arnold... all 12 of them.

152
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,889
What about a-a beard trim?

153
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,696
Well, I'll fit you in between
the bleach and the blow job

154
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,668
if you get me some foil.

155
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,466
They're nicking that as well.

156
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,734
If they're not smoking it,
they're sniffing.

157
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,105
You'll have to shave it off
anyway.

158
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,667
What, my beard?

159
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,677
Who told you that?

160
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,374
I got to make you
a Mandarin black mustache.

161
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,384
You can't play a Chinese
with a red beard.

162
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,579
I need them right now.

163
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,687
No.
I am not shaving my beard off.

164
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,249
No way.

165
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,318
What are you looking at?

166
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,334
Mr. East?

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,074
Watch any video online with Open-SUBTITLES
Free Browser extension: osdb.link/ext

168
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,943
- You've complained that...
- My mail is being tampered with.

169
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:58,213
Gifts stolen, money removed,
my videos taken.

170
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,777
Your mail is automatically
checked.

171
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,416
And cash, postal orders,
and checks amounting to Â£7,000

172
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,857
have been listed.

173
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,361
You're not allowed videotapes.

174
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,698
But they are educational.

175
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,995
How do you intend to play

176
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,764
these so-called
educational tapes, Mr. East?

177
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,328
It is usual to use
a video recorder, Ms. Hewitt.

178
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,835
And we have one in our lounge.

179
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,844
I'd like to look over
Mr. East's cell.

180
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,313
Step out, East.

181
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,284
Officer Welks.

182
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,418
If there is any single item
in Mr. East's cell

183
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,412
that is not approved
and on his possessions list,

184
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,861
then I want it removed.

185
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,658
Ma'am.

186
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,959
And as from today,

187
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,227
his mail is to be limited
to three letters per day.

188
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,031
And please remove all
of that stack of correspondence,

189
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,594
as it is a fire hazard.

190
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,798
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

191
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,932
You won't forget, will you,
Ms. Hewitt?

192
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,705
Oh, and make sure the cell
doubling as a hairdressing salon

193
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,246
is used for that purpose.

194
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,612
It closes at 5:00.
It stays locked.

195
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,843
Scissors removed.

196
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,714
Oh, Barber's a decent
little bloke, ma'am.

197
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,254
I'm sure he is, but there are
others here who aren't.

198
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,721
21-3.
My game.

199
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,122
I got a visit.

200
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,598
If you need any puff, rocks,
smack... name it...

201
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,794
- I can deliver.
- You dealing?

202
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,269
It's just a phone call away.

203
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,005
I don't approve of drugs.

204
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,634
Uh, are you gonna play, Tarzan,
or not?

205
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,137
It's your serve.

206
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,677
I really hate it down here,
Ms. Hewitt.

207
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,652
I want to go back on the C Wing.

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,484
You're on
the Vulnerable Prisoners Wing

209
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,989
for your own protection.

210
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,958
I can't put you back
on an ordinary wing.

211
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,688
Look, Ms. Hewitt.

212
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,220
I've got to face
that sick, queer, pervert killer

213
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,298
every morning.

214
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,701
He gloats.
You know what I mean?

215
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,272
I mean,
he's got people working for him.

216
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,467
The man gets fan mail.
You know what I'm saying?

217
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,340
That's sickening!

218
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,369
I just don't want to be
around him, yeah?

219
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,024
And those queer boys,
they won't leave me alone.

220
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,848
I mean, they want to drill out
my bottom hole.

221
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,681
You know what I mean?

222
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,618
All right, Ms. Hewitt.
All right.

223
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,315
Don't go, yeah?

224
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,961
Oh.

225
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,497
Uh...

226
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:08,373
What if I was to make a deal
with you, Ms. Hewitt?

227
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,069
Just so that I could get out
of here.

228
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,409
I'm not here to make deals.

229
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,813
No.

230
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,346
Well, let me run this one
by you, Ms. Hewitt.

231
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,293
I know every major drug dealer
in this nick.

232
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,425
I know who brings it in.

233
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,902
I know who passes it out
on the wings.

234
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,732
I know who the runners are...
and I know all the barons.

235
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,075
We know this.

236
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,775
Every prison knows this.
But you know what we might have?

237
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,908
A bloody whopper of a headache.

238
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,513
If this gets out, he could get
cut up or probably even worse.

239
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,181
Did he know he was being
recorded?

240
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,527
Mm.

241
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,619
There are a lot of users
on the VP Wing...

242
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,994
Ones that have asked
for their own protection.

243
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,056
It is a bit of a farce, though,
really, isn't it?

244
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,934
They use us for Rule 43,
when they owe the barons money.

245
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,030
And then, once they've got
the money they owe them,

246
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,316
they want to go back
on the wing.

247
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,505
Cons hate rapists, but a grass
will get his throat cut.

248
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,604
Now, we've got no option
but to move him.

249
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:27,282
If he's willing to name names,
then I'll get him his transfer.

250
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,754
He won't grass till he's moved.

251
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,567
Can you make sure Governor Syons

252
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,958
gets that to, uh, Eugene Buffy,
please?

253
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,620
Yeah.
Sure.

254
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,132
Mr. Turnbull
is here in healthcare

255
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,137
with his client, Mr. Falla,

256
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,140
and Mr. Morgan's
in the staff room.

257
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,508
Mavis, could you get me, um,
something for an upset stomach?

258
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,343
That pink stuff.

259
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,144
Mavis.

260
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,912
Is Mr. Morgan all right?

261
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,852
Yeah. I think so.

262
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,823
If you want to take a break
at any time, just say so.

263
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,794
If you don't understand
any of the questions,

264
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,421
don't be afraid to ask for them
to be repeated.

265
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,524
You are not on trial in any way,
Mr. Morgan.

266
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,332
This is just
a preliminary inquiry

267
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,463
into the hostage situation.

268
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,531
Now, there'll be
two police officers

269
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,270
asking you
the relevant questions.

270
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,343
All right?

271
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,908
Do I go straight
to the boardroom or do I wait?

272
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,043
Uh, no.
Uh, we'll page you.

273
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,462
- Oh, this is for you.
- Oh, great.

274
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,421
Mavis said you had
an upset tummy.

275
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,356
You all right?

276
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,827
Yeah.
Fine.

277
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,358
Thanks.

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,095
Well, there's no brain damage
to Kevin Watts,

279
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,697
but they are worried about him
and want to keep him monitored.

280
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,038
Speech is, uh, very slurred.

281
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,475
Oh.

282
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,035
Excuse me.
That's disgusting.

283
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,241
- Are they talking about me?
- No.

284
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,114
I'm sick to death of people
talking about me behind my back.

285
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,710
They're not, all right?

286
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,662
Hey, Jumbo.

287
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,064
I was told to bring this down.

288
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,103
It's a tape recorder
and a brand-new tape.

289
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,314
- Governor Syons wants it.
- I don't know what that's about.

290
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,931
You'd better put it
in the office.

291
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,441
Did you see Russell Morgan?

292
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,274
- He's not the same man, is he?
- He isn't.

293
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,007
Hey, Eugene!

294
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,324
Stop gassing and get your lunch.

295
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,680
All right, Gov. All right.

296
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,285
No. It's Tarzan.
Can you see him?

297
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,763
He's coming on the line.
Can you see him?

298
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,931
I don't want to see him.
I owe him favors from the block.

299
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,048
Oh, you're dead.

300
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,524
- Hey, Tarzan. Welcome to C Wing.
- Will you shut up?

301
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,890
Morning.

302
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,563
I've got your tray for you,
Tarzan.

303
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,366
Oi!

304
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,402
I don't approve of drugs,

305
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,907
so there'll be no drugs
on this wing, okay?

306
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,675
I'm Eric.

307
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,146
Hello, Eric.
Now get out of my face.

308
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,780
S-Sorry, Tarzan.

309
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,496
What are you doing
with potatoes and pudding?

310
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Put it back.

311
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,090
You want just soup, meat,
and veg.

312
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,489
The state of you.

313
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,255
You're overweight and unfit.

314
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,297
You want protein, no carbs.

315
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,094
Sorry, Tarzan.

316
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,270
Who wants to work out with me
in the gym,

317
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,498
do one-on-one training?

318
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,268
Yeah. Great, Tarzan.
Yeah.

319
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,638
I'll go to the gym with you.

320
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,903
I'm on medication.

321
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,880
I've never seen him
so well behaved.

322
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,279
Everything all right, Tarzan?

323
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,340
So far so good, Mr. Jackson.

324
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,283
I want to be in this musical,
you know.

325
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,650
I'm afraid it's fully cast,

326
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,348
but uh, you can come
to the show.

327
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,414
Mm.
Good.

328
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,618
I want to be in everything.

329
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,752
Want to be involved
in everything.

330
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,954
When can I see the show?

331
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,088
Not just yet
because we're still rehearsing.

332
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,996
How many performances are there?

333
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,500
Just the one.

334
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,059
Better be good, then, hadn't it?

335
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,702
You require Dr. Harris,
all the officers on duty,

336
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,710
and S.O. Russell Morgan.

337
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,246
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

338
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,110
Sorry.
Have I kept everyone waiting?

339
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,309
- Perfect timing.
- Thank you.

340
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,579
If you'd like to sit
on this side of the table.

341
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,120
- Right.
- Here you are.

342
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,018
Thanks.

343
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,683
Just a reminder...
Will you call Mr. Andrews at HQ,

344
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,248
perhaps after the meeting's
adjourned?

345
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,453
- Okay.
- Ah! We're all gathered. Good.

346
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,432
Right.
Where shall I park myself?

347
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,094
There's a chair for Mr. Falla
when he is called.

348
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,037
I would like him present
throughout.

349
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,939
I do not think Mr. Morgan
should be subjected

350
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,273
to facing him across a table.

351
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,574
I have no intention of doing so.

352
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,482
Hm?

353
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,382
You have something white
on your upper lip.

354
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,212
I'll kick off
the preliminary discussions,

355
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,281
which deal with
Barfield's security

356
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,792
and transfer arrangements
on the day in question...

357
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,091
- Is it gone?
- November the 22nd,

358
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,256
which in case anyone here
is not aware,

359
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,631
that was the date that
my client, Mr. George Falla,

360
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,162
was accused of taking Senior
Officer Russell Morgan hostage.

361
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,069
Perhaps you could outline
for me, Ms. Hewitt.

362
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,908
Or, as you were not actually in
charge of Barfield at the time,

363
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,040
perhaps you'd care to delegate
to someone who was?

364
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,276
I was the HOC

365
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,718
and... and acting governor
on the 22nd of November.

366
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,312
Would that be because the...

367
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,256
The then-governor of Barfield
was unavailable

368
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,317
because he was playing
a round of golf?

369
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,885
Mr. Turnbull,
Governor Keller is no longer

370
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,329
with the prison services.

371
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,798
Well, now he's retired, he'll
have plenty of time for golf.

372
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,099
Could you now take me through
the transfer of prisoners

373
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,402
from their release,
in the case of Mr. Falla,

374
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,001
from Parkhurst Prison to
their arrival here at Barfield?

375
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,739
HQ issued a movement order,

376
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,714
which was then faxed here
to Governor Keller.

377
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,478
The officers accompany
the transportee.

378
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,545
The times for the relocation are
decided between the two prisons.

379
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,614
In this case,
the prisoner, George Falla,

380
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,885
was in a wheelchair,

381
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,894
but traveled in a CAT-A
reinforced van.

382
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,556
But the hospital wing did not
have the relevant information

383
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,260
regarding my client's
previous prison records

384
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,460
and security records.

385
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,594
No, they did not, but...

386
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,662
They remained at reception and
were then sent to the governor,

387
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,231
who was, as we know, absent.

388
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,005
So the officers
in the hospital wing

389
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,377
were not aware of my client's
previous prison records.

390
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,075
More coffee?

391
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,055
Oh, hot.

392
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,487
Hot in here.

393
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,694
It's quiet.

394
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,868
It's quiet in this section.

395
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,335
Different from the wings.

396
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,279
When I joined up first,

397
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,476
I thought I'd never get used to
the noise.

398
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,611
It's constant... noise, noise.

399
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,857
But in the end,
you don't hear it.

400
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,292
Mr. Morgan, would you
come into the boardroom now?

401
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,232
Is he in there?

402
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,101
Is that bastard Falla in there?

403
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,038
No, he's not.

404
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,807
You okay?

405
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,313
I'm fine.

406
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,885
Testing.
One, two. One, two.

407
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,978
This is Eugene Buffy,
Barfield Prison DJ...

408
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,989
- Eugene?
- Coming at you loud and clear

409
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,434
- with the number-one musical...
- Eugene.

410
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,458
Hang on a minute, Bri.

411
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,870
You can record it on mine if you
can't work that one, you know.

412
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,123
I <i>can</i> work this one.

413
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,131
I want two tapes, not one tape.
Two tapes.

414
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:52,927
Why?

415
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,661
Because I don't trust
the bastards.

416
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,203
This way, you know, we get
our evidence and we keep it.

417
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,670
- A bit like our little weapon.
- Yeah, man.

418
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,799
This is Eugene Buffy,
Barfield Prison DJ,

419
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,570
- Eugene?
- Coming at you loud and clear

420
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,576
with the number-one...

421
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,045
I saw this mop against the wall
of Mr. Falla's cell.

422
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,113
I crossed to get it.

423
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,524
It shouldn't have been left
in the cell.

424
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,277
Yes.

425
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,409
As I got to it,
Falla struck me from behind,

426
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,010
forcing me to the floor.

427
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,783
He beat my head repeatedly
against the toilet bowl.

428
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,553
He broke the mop in two pieces,
smashed two medical bottles,

429
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,991
and stuck them on the ends.

430
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,495
He used the mop like a weapon,
like a bullfighter,

431
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,622
- jabbing at me...
- He broke the mop...

432
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,663
he put the bottles
on each end, he smashed them,

433
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,499
and he came at you
like a bullfighter.

434
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,766
That must have taken some time.
Why was that?

435
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,501
I was unconscious.

436
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,043
When I awoke, I was bound
hand and foot to a chair,

437
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,874
gagged,
with a noose 'round my neck.

438
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,709
Were you not, Mr. Morgan,
very scared?

439
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,781
Yes.

440
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,249
Perhaps the experience was even
more traumatic...

441
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,081
Because you had previously
been taken hostage

442
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,883
and held in a closed cell

443
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,321
and forced to get down
on your knees and beg.

444
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,985
Yeah, but this time I had
a bottle jabbed into my neck.

445
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,993
You see this?

446
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,030
You want to see what else
he did to me?

447
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,725
Mr. Morgan, I am in no way
making light of your injuries

448
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,200
or of the terror
that you must have felt.

449
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,901
You would also have been on duty
for 18 hours.

450
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,904
That is true.

451
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,450
Mr. Morgan, would you like
to take a break?

452
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,670
No.
Why?

453
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,542
They're about to take a break.

454
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,728
Mr. Morgan should have had
more than just a break

455
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,880
on the afternoon
of November the 22nd last.

456
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,549
Senior Officer Morgan
is not on trial here.

457
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,422
His work has been exemplary
for more than 10 years!

458
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,429
And a fat lot of good
it's gonna stand for.

459
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,295
You bastards can bring me here
for this so-called Inquiry,

460
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,890
but it's not for my benefit,
is it?

461
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,163
It's for the prisoner
who did this to me.

462
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,704
- Come on.
- I can't sleep.

463
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,967
I can't work.
I can't eat.

464
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,100
All I can think about
is what happened in that cell.

465
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,940
Hey, you gonna tell me
who is taking care of me?

466
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,912
- Who is looking after my wife?
- Come on.

467
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,346
I am sick of the lot of you.

468
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,526
You think I don't know you're
gonna let that evil bastard

469
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,590
get away with what he did?

470
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,143
- Well, screw you all.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

471
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,984
Gary.
Stay with him.

472
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,317
You seen Russell Morgan?

473
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,089
He's in the yard, Gov.

474
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,790
It's lockup. Come on.
Back to your cells.

475
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,475
Come on, you lads!
Let's be having you now.

476
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,592
We ain't got all day.

477
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,931
Lockup!
Back to your cells now!

478
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,595
Oi!
You, down the far end!

479
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,332
Move when I say.
Go on.

480
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,005
Don't you hang around
when I talk to you,

481
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,133
you ugly little man.

482
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,404
Come on. Let's be having you.
Back to your cells.

483
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,537
Move!
Move when I talk to you!

484
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,613
Inside!

485
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:25,648
Hey.

486
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,710
I've had Williams
take Russell Morgan home.

487
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,915
Good.
I'm gonna go over to see him.

488
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:33,926
Ms. Hewitt, Mr. Marshall,
could we continue?

489
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,497
Now, would you tell
everyone here, Mr. Falla,

490
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,837
a little
of your medical history?

491
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:57,316
When I was 12 years old,
my father became very ill.

492
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,651
He was diagnosed as having
cancer of the bowels.

493
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:09,353
It took nearly two years
for him... to pass on.

494
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,265
And I saw him become a skeleton,

495
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,133
unable to feed himself, dress...

496
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,071
or do anything for himself.

497
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,140
It left me with a deep emotional
scar and a terror of illness.

498
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,473
Especially anything
to do with the bowels.

499
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,482
Look, I don't know
about balaclavas.

500
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,043
I mean, I'm not sure about this.

501
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,918
- Maybe you wait a few days.
- No.

502
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,652
You said you wanted us to knock
Keith Smith about for you.

503
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,970
We're prepared to do it, but
you've got to play your part.

504
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,326
- Come on.
- I know. I know.

505
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,454
I just don't know when.

506
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,431
You leave the cell door open
for us, then.

507
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,558
If you do, we'll go down there
and do him in.

508
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,567
You made the deal.

509
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,866
Okay.
I'll get the masks.

510
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,771
But don't do anything
till I tell you, all right?

511
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,571
I've got to go now.
Look.

512
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,805
Here's some extra smokes,
and there's paper, all right?

513
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,644
Nice one.
Thank you.

514
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:06,951
- Whoa.
- Yes.

515
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,888
We've got him, Bri.

516
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,787
We've got the bleeding lot
of them now, mate.

517
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,053
Here's some extra smokes,
and there's paper.

518
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,994
Thing is, Eugene,
when they know we've got this,

519
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,462
they're gonna do a strip search.

520
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,021
It won't get us a deal
for open nick.

521
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,260
No.
I've thought about that.

522
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,878
We're gonna give it to Tarzan
to protect it.

523
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,497
Oh, that's brilliant.
Nice one.

524
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,848
Who's gonna give it to him,
though?

525
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,841
You.
He's your mate, isn't he?

526
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,070
You little bastard.

527
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,647
- Governor.
- Gov.

528
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,648
- Well?
- You said you wanted proof.

529
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,911
Here's your proof.

530
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,864
- Oh, let me keep it.
- Let's keep that, Gov.

531
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,322
- No.
- Come on. It's a little tape.

532
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,323
Hand it over.

533
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,223
Oh, all right.

534
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,301
Swivel.

535
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:06,368
Then six years ago,
when I was in Brixton,

536
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,108
I had to have an enema
for constipation.

537
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,583
We <i>have</i> got Mr. Falla's
medical reports, Mr. Turnbull.

538
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,731
I'm aware of that,

539
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,654
but you do not have in detail
the emotional reasons,

540
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,123
nor the deep-seated fear
under which my client has acted.

541
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,854
Your client, Mr. Turnbull,
has been sentenced

542
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,453
for three terms
for his part in armed robbery.

543
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,022
I've always maintained
my innocence.

544
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,398
- Well, on the last one...
- Y-Yes, I think at this stage

545
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,946
we should give Mr. Falla
the opportunity,

546
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,838
before being questioned
by D.C.I. Tully and D.S. Marsh,

547
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,603
to explain his state of mind.

548
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,906
You may continue, Mr. Falla.

549
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,889
All prisoners
in the educational classes,

550
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,472
form a line at the gate.

551
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,076
Those on metal
and woodwork shops, wait.

552
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,485
Well, we listened to the tape.

553
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,024
They've got him,
the stupid bastard.

554
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,083
So what happens next?

555
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,923
She'll have to decide
what we do from here.

556
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,224
Look out.
He's coming.

557
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,829
Tarzan on workshop, is he?

558
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,961
Occasionally.

559
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,438
Applied for beginner's
computer training.

560
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,031
Bugger me.

561
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,770
Make sure you've got
some extra backup.

562
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,867
All right.

563
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,641
You then placed
both broken medical bottles

564
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,306
on the end of the mop pieces.

565
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,585
No comment.

566
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,052
Is it right
that you then threatened

567
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,318
and assaulted
Senior Officer Morgan?

568
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,327
No comment.

569
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,130
Is it still all right
to say nothing?

570
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,932
You then fought
this same officer

571
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,301
and in doing so slashed
his throat several times.

572
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,033
I deny slashing his throat.

573
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,717
Do you agree
you might have caused an injury

574
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,505
in the throat area?

575
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,338
No comment.

576
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,074
Do you accept
that you made various threats

577
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,143
to kill Officer Morgan?

578
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,983
No comment.

579
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,653
Do you accept
you tied him to a chair?

580
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:07,898
No comment.

581
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,632
During the early stages
of negotiation

582
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,640
between yourself
and senior prison staff,

583
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,404
you displayed a knowledge of
the procedure of such incidents.

584
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,446
How did you come by
that knowledge?

585
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,639
No comment.

586
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,239
Was it because you've held
hostages in a similar manner

587
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,875
in a prison situation before?

588
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,975
No comment.

589
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,521
By persistently answering
"no comment" to these questions,

590
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,454
are you saying
you don't wish to answer

591
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,857
or are you denying
these allegations ever happened?

592
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,328
It is my right
not to answer questions.

593
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,100
You wish to say something,
Mr. Bunny?

594
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,904
No comment.

595
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,269
Will you all take
your exercise books

596
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,638
from the shelf, okay?

597
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,271
And also... settle down... take
one of these leaflets, okay?

598
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,814
What's a fax machine?

599
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,474
Well, it's about that big, like.

600
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,389
But that's a printer.
That's not a fax machine.

601
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,013
If it were a fax machine,
you put the paper in there,

602
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,749
and then you dial the number,
right?

603
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,087
So the paper goes in this end
and out there,

604
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,702
and at the other end,
they get the message.

605
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,388
Stop talking, please.

606
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,589
- As we have more students...
- Which other end?

607
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,741
- Well, you've sent it now.
- Than we have machines,

608
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,963
two people will have to work
the same word processor, okay?

609
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,435
How does it do that?

610
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,666
Well, they've got a fax machine
at their end.

611
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,968
It's all done with codes.

612
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,973
What codes?

613
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,236
Phone numbers.

614
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,073
- I'm not talking to you.
- Settle down.

615
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,289
Do you think we can bring
up porno from the Internet?

616
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,043
- How does it work?
- I don't know.

617
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,812
If it was a fax machine,
you'd put the paper here,

618
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,912
it comes out there,
and then they get it.

619
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,718
What, the same piece of paper?

620
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,418
No. They've got their paper
at the other end.

621
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,690
The keyboard now here,
on the word processor,

622
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,664
is structured like
an ordinary typewriter, okay?

623
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,825
But your commands...

624
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
It rolls out from their end.

625
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,963
- The light comes on and...
- Please sit down.

626
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,569
- Can you type?
- No.

627
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,543
I can.
I can type.

628
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,545
Can you take care of this?
I'll explain later.

629
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:06,279
Brian, all of you, please,
do not talk amongst yourselves.

630
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,481
Mr. Tarzan, isn't it?

631
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,614
Yes.

632
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,055
Glad you could join us.

633
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,751
Thank you.

634
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,659
Well, how much typing
have you done before?

635
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,821
Uh...

636
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,455
Do you have a speed?

637
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,863
What?

638
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,663
You want to show me?

639
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,633
Yeah.

640
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,568
Do you touch-type
or need to look?

641
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,230
I wouldn't mind touching her up,
eh?

642
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,709
You behave yourself, son, or
I'll put you through that wall.

643
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,478
- Sit down!
- What the fuck?

644
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,848
Sit!

645
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,918
Shut up!

646
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,247
The next one of you
starts talking,

647
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,054
I'll give you a thrashing.

648
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,472
I could do it a lot faster,
you know, if it was a real one.

649
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,439
Good.

650
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,237
Now pass the card to Brian.

651
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,620
You'll be able to start
straightaway

652
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,010
on the word processor.

653
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,446
This isn't in alphabetical
order, you know, miss.

654
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,574
That is the point, Brian.

655
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,987
The keyboard is structured to
assist fast movement, all right?

656
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,490
The letters are arranged
QWERTYUIOP.

657
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:25,429
Q-W-E-R-T-Y-U-I-O-P.

658
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,658
Okay.

659
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,227
Does anyone have any idea
why they are arranged

660
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,068
in this particular order?

661
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,108
- Miss?
- Yes.

662
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,767
Because we use them the most.

663
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,069
Yes.
Good.

664
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,580
- Ooh! He got it right.
- Ooh!

665
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,413
Ooh!

666
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,484
No comment.

667
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,896
During the continued assault
on Officer Morgan,

668
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,788
you placed a noose,
or a ligature, around his neck

669
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,984
and you tightened it.

670
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,583
Why was that?

671
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,722
No comment.

672
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,790
You continued to threaten
Officer Morgan

673
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,710
inasmuch as you were intending
to take his life.

674
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,100
Was that really your intention?

675
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,038
No comment.

676
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,472
This interview will terminate
here.

677
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,269
Due to police procedure,

678
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,454
you have the right to read
the record of this interview.

679
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,413
If you agree it to be a true
and accurate record,

680
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,278
you may initial
each of your answers

681
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,944
and sign at the foot
of each page.

682
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,578
Will you do that?

683
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,691
Yes.

684
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,760
Well, at least <i>that</i> got
a response.

685
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,833
Is it still all right to say no?

686
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,776
D.C.I. Tully, the governor
would like to see you

687
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,369
before you leave.

688
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,352
W-Why... Why am I in here?

689
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,829
I-I w-w-want to hold my baby.

690
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,731
Sorry, Kevin.
Nothing to do with us.

691
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,326
Kev?

692
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,531
Kev, what's the matter with you?

693
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,471
- W-W-W...
- What have they done to you?

694
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,873
N-Nothing.
H-Hold him.

695
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,038
- Kev, your voice is all slurred.
- L-Let me see him.

696
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,412
And your face.

697
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,049
- Who did this to you?
- S-Show me the baby.

698
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,580
Anna, s-show me my boy.

699
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,828
The escaped prisoner,
Kevin Watts.

700
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,094
What about him?

701
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,328
When he was returned to us,

702
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,339
he had severe bruises
covering almost his entire body.

703
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,638
Did he need to be restrained
by any of your officers?

704
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,645
I don't know
what you're implying.

705
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,114
Did he require to be restrained
by your officers?

706
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,445
I have no knowledge
of any extra force being used

707
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,045
to restrain
the escaped prisoner.

708
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,050
Has he filed a complaint?

709
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,793
No.

710
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,058
Then there's, uh,
nothing more to be said.

711
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,130
Excuse me.

712
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,910
All right, Kevin. Time's up.

713
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,664
Visit's over.
Let's go.

714
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,705
Hey.

715
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,306
Let's go, Kevin.

716
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,105
Andy?

717
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,839
Kevin!

718
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,405
Kevin, don't fight them!
Don't fight them! Please!

719
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,179
Let's go.

720
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,722
Could you, um, find me
that stuff for my upset stomach?

721
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,936
I don't know where I left it.

722
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,826
Shellfish.
I never touch it.

723
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,057
It wasn't shellfish.
It was chicken.

724
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,292
You might have salmonella.

725
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,960
Did you friend have it
as well... Mr. Lennox?

726
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,335
I believe you left this
in the boardroom.

727
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,861
Oh, thank you.

728
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,374
You mind if I say something?
Without prejudice.

729
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,552
You're going to try and prove

730
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,442
that George Falla
is mentally unstable.

731
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,613
Mr. Falla was obviously
greatly distressed and desperate

732
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,811
to get the correct medical
assessment of his illness.

733
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:07,885
Bullshit.

734
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:11,515
He's a nasty, vicious bastard
with a string of convictions

735
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,819
and a history of violence

736
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,019
towards officers
and inmates alike.

737
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,857
What are you trying to prove,
eh?

738
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,658
That everyone held
in Her Majesty's prisons

739
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,997
has the legal right
to proper medical treatment

740
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,971
and not to be forced into taking
drastic steps to ensure it.

741
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,666
Thank you for your cooperation,
Ms. Hewitt.

742
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,539
Mr. Marshall,
would you show Mr. Turnbull

743
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,340
to the gate, please?

744
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,649
Mavis, would you, uh, would you
call Mr. Lennox, please?

745
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,446
Ask if he's poorly too, shall I?

746
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,511
No, Mavis.
I need him to drive me home.

747
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,290
I don't know about you,
but I don't like it.

748
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,919
I mean, he may be the new boy
on the block,

749
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,691
but I hate it.

750
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,163
'Cause every time he comes up
to me,

751
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,632
I make some excuse to walk away.

752
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,758
Who are you on about?

753
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,996
Come on.
Officer Hully. Jason.

754
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,662
- Ah.
- That's nice. What is it?

755
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,764
I just stay well out of it,
mate.

756
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,570
- Is it expensive, this?
- Don't know.

757
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,110
Oh!
Bloody hell.

758
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,304
I'll stick to me Old Spice.

759
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:08,879
Which one?

760
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,917
Well, they're both all right.
Are they silk, are they?

761
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,679
Hey.

762
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,453
I mean, Ms. Hewitt, she said
not to mention it to him,

763
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,924
but I don't like it.

764
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,790
Neither does Len Syons.

765
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,885
And according to Buffy

766
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,932
and that other little Scouse git
Samora, he's bent.

767
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,091
I preferred the other one.

768
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,794
What, gay?
Are you kidding me?

769
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,733
No.

770
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,747
Bent, as in trying to get
those two little pillocks

771
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,296
to beat up Keith Smith.

772
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,739
Oh, well, I know he's been
having a go at him for weeks,

773
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,674
but Smith gives the aggro
to all of us.

774
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,972
Do you know what I mean?

775
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,512
This is serious.

776
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,483
They say he's bringing in
balaclavas.

777
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,452
Oh, yeah.
What, and a baseball bat?

778
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,715
They're just having a go.

779
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,313
She ain't taking it seriously,
is she?

780
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,324
She's taking it seriously.

781
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,292
They've got him repeating it
on tape.

782
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,726
Ooh.

783
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,654
Are we on for a game of darts
tonight?

784
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,359
Yeah, I'm on for that.

785
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,166
Oi.

786
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,232
Hey.
Do you want some advice?

787
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,709
Stay well out of it, mate.

788
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,011
Hey.
He's one of us.

789
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,916
Yeah.
Uh, maybe he is.

790
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,115
And maybe, just maybe, he isn't.

791
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,681
Oh.
Got a date, have you?

792
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,023
I sincerely hope so.

793
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,153
Good night.

794
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,853
Good night.

795
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,259
Going down the pub?

796
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,767
Not tonight.

797
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,337
Got a date as well, have you?

798
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,503
Nope.

799
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,206
But I deserve one.

800
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,818
Good night.

801
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,548
Yeah.

802
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,349
Anyone coming down the pub?

803
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,660
I can't have you persuade
or cajole me into something

804
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,894
that I don't feel
fully confident about taking on.

805
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,460
Now, what exactly have you told
everyone?

806
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,369
Nothing.

807
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,237
But you <i>are</i> a lawyer,
aren't you?

808
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,832
I mean,
are you so inundated with work

809
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,344
that you can't even consider it?

810
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,875
No comment.

811
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:26,813
Simon.

812
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,252
I've only just been made a
junior partner, for God's sake.

813
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,256
Well, maybe you'd make senior if
you showed a bit of initiative.

814
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,416
What?!

815
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,255
You know,
just because you run Barfield

816
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,125
doesn't mean you run me,
my life, or my business.

817
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,995
You have no right
even to... to insinuate

818
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,092
that I might take on
what's-his-name!

819
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,636
Russell Morgan.

820
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,069
I thought you'd read the file.

821
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,448
Well, perhaps
you wouldn't be suitable

822
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,134
if you can't even remember
the man's name!

823
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,039
He has nothing to do with me!

824
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,840
But he has a lot to do with me
and that bastard Turnbull!

825
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,278
You said he was good.
Well, he is.

826
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,248
And all I want is somebody
as good as he is to represent...

827
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,649
Oh, forget it. Just forget it.

828
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,984
I'm sorry.
I presumed too much.

829
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,989
Put it down to an addiction
to Bisodol.

830
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,719
- Well, go to bed, then.
- I am going!

831
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,653
Look.

832
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,895
Just give me
your professional opinion.

833
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,434
You see,
I think that the prison service

834
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,308
was Russell Morgan's life.

835
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,774
And I doubt that he will
ever be fit enough...

836
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,843
Well, mentally fit enough...
To work for them again.

837
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,480
He is such a nice man, Simon.

838
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,317
Such a good officer.

839
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,431
Is Anthony Turnbull the reason
you won't consider this?

840
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:57,203
No, it isn't
bloody Anthony Turnbull.

841
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,286
You may know everything there is
about running a prison,

842
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,939
but you know bugger-all
about the law.

843
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,881
I know that Turnbull
is making my officer feel

844
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,282
that it was his fault
that he was taken hostage!

845
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,285
No, Helen, he isn't.

846
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,412
He's attempting to prove

847
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,615
that his client was in
a serious state of ill health.

848
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,454
He only had inflammation
of the bowel!

849
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,654
And that without
the correct medical attention,

850
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,959
his client was forced
into taking the action

851
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,296
which subsequently resulted
in your officer's condition.

852
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,665
Whose side are you on?

853
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,728
Yours...
If you'll just be patient.

854
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,907
If Russell Morgan sues
the prison service,

855
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,246
he will get little
or no compensation,

856
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,310
because it is not responsible
for the cutbacks.

857
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:46,722
However, there's a possible
alternative...

858
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,919
Sue the people
who <i>are</i> responsible.

859
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,662
The Home Office?

860
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,925
Yes.

861
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,796
Now, it could have repercussions
for you.

862
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,427
If you encourage Morgan
to take them on,

863
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,497
they'll know,
and they won't like it.

864
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,845
You still want me to take on
his case?

865
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:42,403
Oi. These flowers
are out of all proportion.

866
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,814
You done those pansies?
You see them?

867
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,250
Pansy perverts.

868
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,617
No. The nonces did the begonias,
over there.

869
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,417
These are good for something,
then.

870
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,422
Tell you what, though.

871
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,968
You wouldn't have daffodils,
would you?

872
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:54,925
Not in your plan.

873
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,985
Hey, Officer Chiswick,
want to tell the nonces

874
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,461
you can't knock off the tree?

875
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,761
I've always liked to do art.
I was dead good at it at school.

876
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,928
How many women are coming
from the operatic society?

877
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,266
Could be half a dozen.

878
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,704
I saw an opera once.
It was full of women.

879
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,004
Well, you guys aren't gonna
pull any, are you?

880
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,270
I mean, you're in drag.

881
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,343
Faggots.

882
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,680
All right. That's it.
Let's go.

883
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,015
Get your overalls packed up.
Clean your brushes.

884
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,486
Make sure you clean
your brushes.

885
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,716
Right! You two!
Oi!

886
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,917
Pack that up!

887
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:33,630
Let's go.

888
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,428
On with you.

889
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,832
Gov says to get back
to the wing.

890
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:37,834
Yeah.

891
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,413
You, uh, you know
you've got paint, uh...

892
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,303
- Yeah, I know. I know. I know.
- No, mate.

893
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,204
It's... It's all down
your pants.

894
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,771
Oh!
You little bastards!

895
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:53,112
Yeah, we've got him taped, man.
Got the magic taped.

896
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,176
Hey, why... why bother
coming all this way

897
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,983
just to tell me someone else
is dead?

898
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,251
Today I painted all the scenery.

899
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,417
We're getting singers in

900
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,017
from the local amateur
dramatic society... women!

901
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,063
They don't have a right...
Any right...

902
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,461
To take my phone card, do they?

903
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,931
No. You're right.
They don't.

904
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:12,027
I swear before God I never made
any threatening phone calls.

905
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,267
Nobody's called me to see
if I can play at rehearsals.

906
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,275
I don't go out
in case I miss the call.

907
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:21,006
You should get an answer phone,
Adele, not just for the musical,

908
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,412
and you should get a man
to record the message.

909
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,813
Safer that way.

910
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,319
So if anyone rings, they don't
know you're a woman alone.

911
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,355
I worry about that, Adele.

912
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,086
Been on my own for a long time.

913
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,682
Not anymore.

914
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,625
You've got me, Adele.

915
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,762
- Shit!
- Calm down, Eugene.

916
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,176
- I'm warning you.
- All this shit!

917
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,101
Now pack it in!

918
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,363
Well, we got another tape.

919
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,338
We got a second tape,
and you won't find it!

920
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,102
- Step out your cell, Eugene.
- Bollocks!

921
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,414
Step out your cell.
Get out now!

922
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,707
You didn't find my Semtex,
did you, you prat?

923
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,373
The Semtex.
You didn't find it.

924
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,678
Right, boys.
Get him here. Take him down.

925
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,683
Take him downstairs.

926
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,720
Brought your girlfriends,
have you?

927
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,918
All screws are bent!
Aah!

928
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,324
Okay. I'll get the masks.

929
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,307
But don't do anything
till I tell you, all right?

930
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,698
Well, they said
they'd get proof.

931
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,429
Can we keep this internal?

932
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:18,834
Might be difficult.

933
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,098
Why?

934
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,639
Buffy said they made a copy.

935
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,335
We made a search.
Didn't find it.

936
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,342
Falla is to be transferred
until his trial.

937
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:32,282
HQ feel
that it would be beneficial

938
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,945
if he were in
a more relaxed prison.

939
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,552
Have you listened to the tape?

940
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:40,717
You've done our pad over,
Jackson!

941
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,658
You've done our pad over!

942
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,026
You've wrecked our room!

943
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,156
I know what you're looking for!

944
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,358
We've got it hidden!

945
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,113
- Why don't you do us a favor...
- Shut up!

946
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,431
Eugene!
Where have they got him?!

947
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,166
- Eugene!
- He's down the block!

948
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,435
- Eugene!
- They took him down the block!

949
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,808
Shit.

950
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,514
I don't think this looks
very good for anyone involved,

951
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,580
Eugene Buffy being held
on the block.

952
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,751
In fact, it stinks.

953
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,851
Well, every officer has the
right to strip-search a cell,

954
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,473
and the little bugger said
he had Semtex.

955
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:20,931
Oh, come on!

956
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,518
We all know
what they were looking for.

957
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:23,694
The second tape, right?

958
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,464
Semtex.

959
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,029
So now we've got to strip it
again, to check it.

960
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,343
Officer Hully
is in the boardroom.

961
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,749
If Eugene Buffy has got Semtex,

962
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,286
then he should not be
in the block.

963
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,685
He should be in the SSU.

964
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,624
So your head hurts, does it?

965
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:47,750
Ooh.
It's shocking, Doc.

966
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,760
It's like I've got... ooh...
Cotton wool in there

967
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,352
or something.

968
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,757
Apart from that,
do you feel all right?

969
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,494
Is that supposed to be a joke?

970
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,799
I was thrown down an iron
staircase, Doc, headfirst.

971
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,464
I could have brain damage
or something.

972
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,633
Yes. All right, Brian.
I'll keep you in overnight.

973
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,007
Could I have something to make
me sleep, please, Doctor?

974
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,273
- Yeah. Get undressed first.
- I already am undressed.

975
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,941
Get some pajamas on, Mr. Samora.

976
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,622
Yes.

977
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,657
I wasn't serious.

978
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,625
I was joking. Honestly.
I swear.

979
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,971
But you do admit the prisoner
Keith Smith was harassing you.

980
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,726
Yeah. Constantly having a go
at me. Yes, he was.

981
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,163
Look.

982
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,826
I know the recording
makes me look... or sound bad,

983
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:35,396
but it was just a joke.

984
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:40,275
There is now a very serious
allegation against you...

985
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,344
And with evidence.

986
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,142
I just don't believe this.

987
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,012
I really don't.

988
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,548
Until it is determined
what the next step will be,

989
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,921
you are suspended from duty.

990
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,290
Shit.
This is unfair.

991
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,279
I'm gonna write
to every newspaper,

992
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:19,875
contact the prison watchdogs,
the prime minister!

993
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,045
- You won't get away with this!
- Mr. Buffy!

994
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,714
- Will you listen to me?!
- I'm gonna write to Judge Tuman!

995
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,690
Eugene, I've got the governor
with me.

996
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,726
We want to talk to you.

997
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,296
I should not have been brought
down here!

998
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,739
This is a plot
to keep me from talking!

999
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,459
I agree. I don't think
you should be here.

1000
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,898
Eh?

1001
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,993
You stated you were
in possession of Semtex.

1002
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,069
Yeah. I'm gonna blow the lot
of you to smithereens!

1003
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,437
- Now, piss off!
- Open the cell door.

1004
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,850
You'll have to take it seriously
now.

1005
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,867
Strip-search his cell
on C Wing and tonight.

1006
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:50,472
Okay.
Trolley's on the wing.

1007
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,876
Trolley's on the wing.

1008
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:55,846
How's the stomach?

1009
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,252
Oh, it's fine.

1010
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,382
Is, uh, Brian Samora well enough
for me to have a quick chat?

1011
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,935
There's nothing much
wrong with him.

1012
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,451
We're keeping him monitored
'cause he fell on his head.

1013
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,861
I'm starving hungry.

1014
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,362
Get out of the way.
Move.

1015
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,672
How are you feeling, Mr. Samora?

1016
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:18,903
Oh, Ms. Hewitt.

1017
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,673
Shocking.
Fell right on me head, you know.

1018
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,580
I was pushed...
Pushed down the stairs.

1019
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,727
Were you very upset about
your cell being strip searched?

1020
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,811
Yeah. We all know what that
was about, don't we?

1021
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,855
Do you know anything
about explosives?

1022
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,117
Explosive?
Oh, it's explosive.

1023
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,693
I'm not saying nothing.
Eugene told me not to.

1024
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,526
I'll tell you one thing, though.
You won't find it.

1025
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,896
Whoever does will get throttled.

1026
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,419
Since when do we have to do
a strip at night?

1027
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,220
Since Eugene Buffy said
he had Semtex.

1028
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,225
I'm not kidding.

1029
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,286
And if he was,
he's gonna be very sorry.

1030
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,392
Where's me cocoa?!

1031
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:17,696
Shut it, Eugene.

1032
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,446
Hey, I've changed me mind!
I want to go back on the wing!

1033
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,497
You ain't going anywhere!
Good night!

1034
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:36,379
The doctor said I can have
another mug full of cocoa.

1035
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,320
Any more choccy biscuits?

1036
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,448
Give us a hand.

1037
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,889
Take that into cubicle 2.

1038
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,085
Whoa.
No way.

1039
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,025
I'm not going near the AIDS lot.
No way.

1040
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,087
It's for Kevin Watts.

1041
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,394
All right.
Take him a few biscuits, yeah?

1042
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,162
Aye, do.

1043
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,632
I've brought your cocoa, mate.

1044
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,469
If you don't want your
choccy biscuits, I'll have them.

1045
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,201
Oh, bleeding hell, Kev.
You been run over?

1046
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,277
You're in a right mess.

1047
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,543
What have they done to you,
mate?

1048
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,549
I fell on me head, you know.

1049
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,211
I'm acting up, actually.
It's cushty in here, isn't it?

1050
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,481
Give us...

1051
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,290
What?

1052
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,885
G-Give me me f-fucking cocoa.

1053
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,820
All right.

1054
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,375
No!

1055
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,780
No! No!
No!

1056
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,685
The specials have not found
anything.

1057
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,320
We checked every tape
in their cell.

1058
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,490
- Nothing.
- So Buffy was lying.

1059
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,261
They both lied.

1060
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,962
It means we could keep this
balaclava business internal.

1061
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,198
No, we don't, Gary.

1062
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,673
Every officer in Barfield
must be trusted.

1063
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,370
What Hully did
was a criminal offense.

1064
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,879
- I stand corrected.
- However...

1065
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,242
cell searches
are within our rights,

1066
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,428
even more so when they're
threatening to blow up Barfield

1067
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,385
with Semtex.

1068
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,631
Get rid of a lot of aggravation,
though, wouldn't it, eh?

1069
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,453
Very true.

1070
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,523
Anyone fancy a pint?

1071
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,493
Ah. That's the best offer
I've had all night.

1072
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,222
- Come on, Gary.
- Allow me.

1073
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,786
Oh. Thank you very much.
I say.

1074
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:26,990
Oh!

1075
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,226
âª Three little maids from school
are we âª

1076
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,235
âª Pert as a schoolgirl
well can be âª

1077
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,171
Lockup!

1078
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,636
Brian?

1079
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,302
Lights out!

1080
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,313
Lights out!

1081
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,714
What are you keeping me waiting
for?

1082
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,117
Get back to your pad, Bert.

1083
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,654
You know the rules.

1084
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,155
