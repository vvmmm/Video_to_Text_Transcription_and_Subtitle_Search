Have you sorted out Karen's hen do yet?

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,020
Yeah, I think so.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,065
It's tricky though, 'cause, uh,
I'm scared of checking my emails,

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,816
'cause I know there's gonna be
bad news about the kids,

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,984
-so...
-Yeah.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,071
-What you gonna do for Scott?
-Just gonna go pub.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,989
-Is that it?
-Well...

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,073
Jase.

10
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,993
How is that different from
any other time you go to the pub?

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,954
-Scott's coming.
-Jason.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,581
Well, it's a bit weird, innit?
I mean, I didn't ask to be his best man.

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,999
I've only known the fella 18 months.

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,751
Yeah, he doesn't have many friends,
does he?

15
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,836
Obviously not.

16
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,838
That's what you get when you
pronounce it "choritho."

17
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:46,922
Mmm.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,675
He's given me a list of three people
that he wants to invite.

19
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,802
One of them is his barber.

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,222
-He couldn't even remember who Scott was.
-[groans]

21
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,099
I had to describe
the back of his head to the guy.

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,101
-[both laugh]
-It's true.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,537
[Jason] Hello?

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,621
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,584
-[Jason] All right. Okay.
-[phone chimes]

26

[sighs]

27
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,764
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,266
Jason!

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,018
Jason!

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,979
-Look. [pants]
-All right then. Thank you. Bye-bye.

31
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,981
I don't believe it! I got the promotion!

32
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,025
I got the promotion! I got the promotion!

33
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,235
[chuckles, breathes heavily]

34
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,281
-What?
-We didn't get the kids.

35
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,366
[Jason clicks tongue]

36
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,498
You need to go.

37
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,209
-We need to talk about what this means.
-No, we don't.

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,127
-Yeah, but does this mean--
-Doesn't mean anything.

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,422
This is not an emotional thing.
This is just--

40
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,382
It's just atoms.

41
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,594
And at one point,
the atoms were in a certain position,

42
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,055
and then they moved
and they were in a different position.

43
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,850
On top of each other.
But it is just atoms.

44
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,020
It doesn't-- It--
Do not add emotion to atoms.

45
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,233
Fine.

46
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,611
-What you doing?
-Going to the toilet.

47
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,112
-Freddy.
-I'm bursting.

48
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,574
-All right. Don't let Lauren see you.
-[Freddy] I won't.

49
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,914
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

50
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,874
-[Lauren] Daddy!
-Oh, f--

51
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,251
Hi, darling.

52
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,461
[sighs]

53
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,214
How long have we been here now?

54
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,676
-About four minutes.
-Oh.

55
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,387
Really? Feels like longer.

56
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
I know.

57
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,561
I miss "five minutes ago" us.

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,021
Yep.

59
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,527
Plenty more kids out there for us,
Nikki, you know?

60
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,945
[Nikki] Yeah.

61
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,156
Did they not just feel
like the ones though?

62
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,912
-Can you not see there?
-What?

63
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,372
Can you not see them? There, there. Look.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,499
-What? Here?
-In the distance, there. Our kids. Look.

65
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,418
Can't you see them?

66
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,712
No.

67
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,882
Oh. That's because you're very short.

68
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,301
-[chuckles] Oh, is that why?
-So-- Yeah.

69
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,386
So you can't see over the horizon.

70
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,429
-Look.
-Oh!

71
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,139
Whoop! [chuckles]

72
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,558
Can you see them now?

73
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,020
-Yeah. I can.
-Yeah? What do you reckon?

74
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,731
-They're very cute.
-They're lovely, ain't they?

75
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,233
-Huh?
-Yeah.

76
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,987
Hmm.

77
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,616
I quite like it up here, you know?

78
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,493
Can you not carry me around all day?

79
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,162
-[sighs] No.
-Why? Aw, why?

80
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
-You're actually heavier than you look.
-Well, you're cheeky.

81
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,540
-Oi.
-[gasps] What?

82
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,876
-Mrs. Manager. [laughs]
-[gasps] I know!

83
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,377
-I know. Yeah.
-All right, I tell you what then.

84
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,588
Show me your best manager point.

85
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,881
-Oh, that's easy.
-Okay.

86
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,801
-Huh, okay. Hmm.
-Jase, that's really good pointing.

87
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,012
No. You've gone a bit disco there.
You've gone a little bit--

88
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,222
little bit Saturday Night Fever.

89
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,389
Right, you wanna trust me.

90
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,308
-Yeah?
-I've been a manager for six weeks, okay?

91
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,185
-Oh, so you know.
-So, it's more like this.

92
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,895
-All right, hmm. Yeah.
-Oh, turning. Hmm, okay.

93
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,231
It's your turn. Yeah, nearly. Ready?

94
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,607
-Okay.
-[imitates whip sound]

95
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,776
-[imitates whip sound]
-[Jason] Wow.

96
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,694
You're ready.

97
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,198
-You're good to go.
-[sighs]

98
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,666
Here you go.

99
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,750
Thanks.

100
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,129
Where did you go?

101
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,131
My mum's.

102
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,220
Look, I'm sorry.
It just-- It wasn't right.

103
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,850
So I am being dismissed by Miss Newman?

104
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,810
Well, it should never have happened.

105
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,061
It didn't happen.

106
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,397
You're ending an affair
that never started.

107
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,442
-Are you gonna be able to get over me?
-Well...

108
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,821
At least there's drawings of you
all over my house.

109
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,322
-[chuckles]
-That'll help.

110
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,867
It's a shame though.

111
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,328
I literally just decided you were worth
pissing off my parents for.

112
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,454
[chuckles]

113
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,124
On the plus side,

114
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,127
I got a feeling Raina's gonna get
a good end of term report.

115
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,546
Uh, no. No, Deven.

116
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,214
That is not how I do things.

117
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,010
And [stammers] she has
a few things to work on, so...

118
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,148
Hiya.

119
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,193
Scott?

120
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,442

[light switch flicks]

124
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,219
[Nikki] So, how come you needed an alibi?
What was that about?

125
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,180
Oh, it's fine.
It was just a miscommunication thing.

126
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,016
Yeah, but Karen,
who were you miscommunicating with though?

127
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,685
I'm sorry, but what is this?

128
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:20,399
Okay. I figured out what you'd love most
by thinking what Erica would hate most.

129
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,733
[woman]
I hope it's got a bar. What a joke.

130
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,239
Oh, my God.

131
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,951
-Oh, my God. I bloody love it! Yes!
-Yes!

132
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,412
-You beauty!
-Yeah.

133
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,330
Hello there. Hi, are you in charge?

134
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,165
Uh, is this what you thought it was?

135
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,376
Yes, Mum! She'll love it!

136
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,462
-Oh, okay. As long as you meant it.
-Yeah.

137
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,718
On our hens, we just used to
have a sherry and a little cry.

138
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,304
Right. Well, there's absolutely no chance

139
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,472
of anyone putting their hand
down my top here, is there?

140
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,183
Complete waste of my time.

141
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,810
-I got a babysitter for this?
-I got a wax.

142
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,271
Well, you'll be more aerodynamic then,
won't you?

143
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,570
[bartender] There we are.

144
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,489
[glasses thud]

145
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,866
How long you been barbering, Yusuf?

146
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,451
Eight years in Turkey.

147
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,120
Four years here. Not happy.

148
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,330
No?

149
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,665
Oh, okay.

150
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,710
But, uh, thanks for coming.

151
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,630
No, I want to.
Things are not good at home.

152
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,423
Oh. Oh.

153
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,759
What grade is that?

154
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,178
-Uh, it was a four, I think.
-Ah, no. No, no, no.

155
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,472
It makes your head look big, man.
