00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,348
You'll be placed on report

160
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,478
for having unauthorized property
in your possession.

161
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,385
You're bloody joking,
aren't you?

162
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,220
I was lent the radio.
He lent me that radio!

163
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,802
Did that prick Walter
say I nicked it?!

164
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,418
Shut it!

165
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,019
Your mate Brinkley's on report
for lending it to you.

166
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,962
You're nuts.

167

You mean, tight-assed bastard!

168
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,934
I only wanted it
to record a program!

169
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,836
Aye, what's all that about?

170
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,706
He doesn't usually
get het up like that.

171
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,177
I just found Walter Brinkley's
radio in his cell.

172
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,645
He's on report for lending it.

173
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,046
Hey, take it easy.
I mean...

174
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,475
Well, it's against
the regulations.

175
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,212
- [Bell ringing]
- Yes.

Oh, you do what you have to.

177
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,784
Workshop's open.

178
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,222
Look, I'm just doing
my bloody job.

179
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,192
Yes.

180
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,194
Now we've got a new inmate
coming on the wing.

181
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,854
Get 48 ready for occupation.

182
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,031
The landings are as before,

183
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:27,404
and identical to C, D, the VP
and seg wings

Gymnasium's in the same area...

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,878
When the prisons go private,
they'll be headhunting.

The first to go
where there's a detached unit.

Hall, Neagle.

189
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,953
Lithgow, Stubbs, Abbott.

If you could just
hold the chitchat.

191
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,956
This is the SSU
maximum-security unit.

192
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,464
It's different
from a control unit.

193
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,309
Play me cards right,
you think I'll get a room?

194
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,963
The men in SSU, Mr. Morgan,
never leave.

00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,903
I want my radio.

196

That is my radio
you took out of Barry's pad!

197
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,236
Well, you can't have it!

198
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,039
You give me back my radio now,

199
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,945
or I'll smash
your frigging face in!

200
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,573
Get out.

201

Get out of this office!

Oh! Oh!

I screwed your mother,
you dirty, dirty little bastard.

[Indistinct shouting]

209
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,043
The roof is made
of very tough Perspex.

210
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,544
It is fire, bullet,
and bombproof.

Exercise yard all covered
in protective meshing.

It'll make our lives
a lot easier.

Mm. Yeah.

LYONS:
Too damn right.

216
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,214
Anyone who works with the real
animals would go for this.

217
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,657
Our problems always
come with the maniacs

218
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,886
with no hope of release.

219
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,258
Bastards who threaten our lives,

220
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,229
'cause they don't give a shit
about their own.

221
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,232
Best place for them.

If you'd been paying attention,
Mr. Morgan,

223
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,771
everything in this unit
is built to contain

not necessarily
the most hardened criminals,

225
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,076
but the high-risk prisoners...

Mafia, terrorists.

227
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,636
Those who can afford
a helicopter?

[Both laugh]

You may well laugh,
but it's close to the truth.

I'm not opening up.

Well, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do, you dickhead!

there would be no need for God.

For the world itself
would be God.

00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,552
estimate how many more months
we're gonna need.

474
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,291
Morning, Governor.

475
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,352
Got to be very diplomatic
about it, though.

476
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,929
That boy in training
for the marathon?

477
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,439
- What's going on?
- Miss Hewitt's orders.

478
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,873
He's the lad that absconded
from his dental appointment.

479
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,207
I wasn't informed about this.

480
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,007
Right, Walter, out.

481
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,548
Take a shower
and then eat your dinner.

482
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,049
No way.

483
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,746
Until I get my radio back,
I'm on hunger strike.

484
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,449
You tell that bitch governor
I'll starve to death

485
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,822
unless I get my radio!

486
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,588
I spoke to Mr. Malahide
this morning,

487
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,821
and he won't go the VP Wing,

488
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,420
so I've moved him
over to D Wing,

489
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,761
and you've got Jackson
as his replacement.

490
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,960
Um, tip-off, Mr. Lyons...

491
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,026
You'll probably be having
the area manager

492
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,096
and the operationals director
wanting to look over the wings.

493
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,766
Okay.

494
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,902
[Beeps]

495
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,571
Hello.

496
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,413
Mavis, since Mr. Andrews
and Mr. Bunny are here,

497
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,062
could you show them
into my office, please?

498
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,554
Yeah, sure.

499
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,465
Car insurance. Shocking prices.
Costs a fortune.

500
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,434
You wanted me to shop around.

501
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,336
Mavis, did you know
or have any prior warning

502
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,338
that they were coming?

503
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,533
No.

504
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,671
Show them in, Mavis.

505
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,413
Mr. Andrews and Mr. Bunny
from prison services HQ.

506
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,363
- Good afternoon, Miss Hewitt.
- Good afternoon.

507
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,662
We're not interrupting anything?

508
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,211
No, no, please, Take a seat.

509
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,449
- Thank you.
- Oh, uh, could he stay?

510
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,719
Of course.
Please.

511
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,129
ANDREWS: Miss Hewitt.

512
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,073
You at no time informed
the authorities that last month,

513
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,009
the same day that two men
escaped by helicopter,

514
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,875
there was also a third escapee.

515
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,382
Um, someone Webster?

516
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,850
He came back voluntarily.

517
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,216
He's now due for release.

518
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,720
He lost 21 days remission.

519
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:58,383
Both officers concerned
were placed on report,

520
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,457
as was Webster.

521
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,231
We're obviously aware
of how difficult it must be

522
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,425
to run Barfield
under these conditions,

523
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,365
which is the reason
that I'm here...

524
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:13,736
To consider if Barfield
should remain in operation

525
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,468
during the rebuilding.

526
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,271
It's now highly questionable.

527
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,743
Right, area manager's
in with the governor

528
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,218
and they might just do
an impromptu walkabout.

529
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,618
Shit!

530
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,555
You're not gonna believe this,
but that prat Walter Brinkley

531
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,852
is on a hunger strike,

532
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,451
till he gets his
frigging radio returned.

533
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,995
This is down to you, mate.

534
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,964
Six month at Pentonville
didn't teach you much, did it?

535
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,072
No, no, you told me to take
that radio off Brinkley.

536
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:45,468
- This isn't down to me.
- It's down to prison rules.

537
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,631
If they can't obey them,
they get what they get,

538
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,265
so anyone starts
even heavy breathing,

539
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,367
you come down on them.

540
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,241
We've got to look
tight as a nut,

541
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,612
'cause the word is they could be
closing this place down,

542
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,015
and I for one
don't fancy detached duties

543
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,518
Christ knows where.

544
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,385
Poor old Smedley's
stuck on the Isle of Wight.

545
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,821
- Come on.
- [Sighs]

546
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,417
Uh, second, Malahide.

547
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,238
If you've got any kit down here,
get it packed up.

548
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,423
You're going on D Wing.

549
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,729
- Why am I being moved?
- Governor's orders. Go on, son.

550
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,943
Oh!
This is beautiful.

551
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,273
Are you on for a game of pool?

552
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,405
No, got to
get this bitch sorted out.

553
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,849
[Coughs]

554
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,443
It's got a hell of a kick.
You get it off Snoopy again?

555
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,080
Here, Anthony.
Have a drag.

556
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,166
You smoking them French fags
again, Colin?

557
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,206
[Coughing]

558
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,870
[Laughter]

559
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,580
It's okay.
They ignore it.

560
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,176
They all know we use it.

561
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,051
Keeps us quiet.
Keeps us happy.

562
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,920
Keeps us.

563
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,119
My God.
I'm reeling.

564
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,626
Go on, have a drag.

565
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,225
âª Oh, hallelujah,
come on, get happy âª

566
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,202
âª Forget your troubles
and wear a smile âª

567
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,464
[Chuckles]

568
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,268
Take a good lungful.
It's good and it's cheap.

569
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,633
Are you going onto the landing?

570
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,770
Yeah.
You play pool, do you?

571
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,336
No.

572
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,645
- Chess?
- No.

573
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,776
Poker?
Rummy? Five-card stud?

574
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,851
No.

575
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,215
Well, I sincerely hope you wank,

576
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,848
or it's gonna be a very boring
18 months in here, sunshine.

577
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,358
Hey, come on.
Pass it on.

578
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,362
Bloody hell.
[Laughs]

579
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,703
Given the time,
I would like to tour the prison

580
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,995
before association ends.

581
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,344
Is there
a good local restaurant?

582
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,248
I'll arrange a table.
Mr. Marshall, would you...

583
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,601
Yes.

584
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,802
What's your reaction
to the new plan for Barfield?

585
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,606
More specifically,

586
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,772
the proposed
special secure unit.

587
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,509
Well, I think
if we have criminals

588
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,813
that require
a 24-hour surveillance,

589
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,512
we need a more
sophisticated method

590
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,248
of housing and controlling them.

591
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,586
Staff approved of the plan too?

592
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,388
Yes, without question.
Total approval.

593
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,190
Apart from Miss Hewitt.

594
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,322
She seemed to be
the only one against it.

595
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,729
Gentlemen.

596
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,606
You're, uh, you're being moved
to C Wing.

597
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:39,201
JACKSON: Why?

598
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,611
Don't ask me.
Governor's orders.

599
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,844
The area manager's doing
an impromptu walkabout.

600
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,544
- You mean on this landing?
- Yeah.

601
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,849
JACKSON: Well, you'd better
check out cell 29, mate.

602
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,219
They've got wacky baccy
lit up in there.

603
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,054
OFFICER: Christ.

604
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,030
Being shafted, are we?

605
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,225
Survive? It's a bit tough
on the other wing, is it?

606
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,098
Just lay off me, fellas.

607
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,662
[Indistinct shouting]

608
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,849
We'd better get that sorted.

609
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,350
The only time they don't
fight over the channels

610
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,138
is when "Baywatch" is on.

611
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,891
Back in, son.

612
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,443
You know what this is about,
don't you?

613
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,992
Nah.

614
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,334
You want to tell me,
you cocksucker.

615
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,337
You know you're bunking up
with a nonce?

616
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,706
You know that?
Oh, he's a nonce.

617
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,041
FOSTER:
No, I'm bloody not.

618
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:47,841
Come on!

619
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,142
Steven, you know me.

620
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,910
Tell this piece of crap
to push off.

621
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,951
I seen it on reports.

622
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,350
He was a VP, wasn't it?

623
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,082
Aye, he's a nonce.

624
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,714
What proof you got?

625
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,485
Look, I ain't no ruddy nonce.

626
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,224
Okay, let's prove it.

627
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,824
We'll hold
a kangaroo court right here.

628
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,596
Harry, you can be judge.

629

You, defense counsel.

00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,100
And you, what's your name?

632
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,040
Kelly.
[Clears throat] Anthony.

633
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,238
Right, Anthony.
You're his solicitor.

634
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,975
Hey!
Stay on your billet, shitface.

635
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,463
Sit down.
Sit down.

636
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,465
I'd say this court's
now in session.

637
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,697
What are you, Victor?

638
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,098
Oh, I'm the hangman.

639
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,037
Book a table would you?
Make sure it's the best.

640
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,413
If not the best, then at least
the most expensive.

641
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,416
Has Moira gone?

642
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,612
Period pains.
I said she could go.

643
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,289
Could you relay that
I've gone home early to change?

644
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,033
I'm sure Mr. Marshall will take
full advantage of my absence.

645
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,566
Just as I feel sure
that you will inform him of it.

646
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,317
Mavis...

647
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,687
You're privy to a lot of
very personal information

648
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,056
regarding myself
and some inmates.

649
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,526
I think
you need to make a decision

650
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,892
whose side you're on.

651
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,124
If you can't keep yourself
from gossiping,

652
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,530
for want of a better word,

653
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,329
then I shall consider you
a security risk.

654
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,097
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

655
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,865
So it's a table for three, then?

656
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,209
Exactly, Mavis.

657
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,403
MAVIS: Are you covered?

658
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,243
Yes. Mr. Marshall can take over
as night duty governor.

659
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,647
I meant your car insurance.

660
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,811
Oh, shit.
I didn't look.

661

[Sighs]

662
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,515
Do I need to take out
a bank loan?

663
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,686
Whatever, Mavis. Please just
keep it to yourself.

664
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,892
Moira's very competent.

665
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,107
Don't struggle, nonce.

666
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,615
You'd be cuffed in court, right?

667
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,583
Judge, am I right?

668

Some of them prefer
to remain in their cells

00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,796
during the association.

672
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,999
Get in, you...

673
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,332
But cell doors must remain open.

674
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,962
Miss Hewitt's orders.

675
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,974
She also withdrew
all prisoners' cell keys.

676
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,601
That almost caused another riot.

REYNOLDS: Good evening,
Mr. Marshall, sir.

678
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:10,047
Just give it a minute.
He's on the toilet.

Safer out here.
He stinks the place up.

on trial for, Colin?

I'd like to hear
what evidence you've got.

So far I am not satisfied.

696

700

And as such,
I sentence him to death.

701

But I need to know now
exactly where I stand.

I think that is a, um...

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,885
Correct assumption.

721
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,799
Well, if I've almost 18 months,

722
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,460
then I intend to use that time

723

to establish strong relations
with my staff.

724

And if you decide
to close it down,

you'll have 88 men to rehouse.

Anyway, we've got the cell
cordoned off.

are down the block.

Well, he wasn't raped or beaten.

the cause of death,

I'm very sorry.

I really am unable
to discuss the incident

any further details.

Anthony has been segregated,

795
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,717
and he will require
legal representation.

796
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:32,120
Tell him we love him
and we'll do anything we can.

797
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,455

We're still waiting
for Mr. Malahide.

We've still not be able to trace
the dead man's mother.

Is she his only relative?

No, no, I'm also trying
to contact her sister.

Oh, God, yes.

Mr. Brinkley, do you understand

810
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,646
that you've been put on report
and why?

00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,399
But as Barry
was needing it for his exam...

816
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:28,105
Do you plead guilty
or not guilty to the charge?

817
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,172
Guilty.
But with mitigations.

818
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,255
Would you explain your actions?

819
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,256
Well, yes, I've been
trying to explain.

820
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,916
You see, Barry Simpkins

821
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,393
is doing
his Open University exam,

822
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,293
and he wanted to record
a program,

823
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,855
so he asked if he could
borrow my radio.

that being put on report
245 times

Of course.
They had to be informed.

I won't believe it until I have
my own radio in my own hands!

I suppose
I'll have to tell Sandra.

I don't want her upset.
She's my girlfriend.

What's gonna happen to me?

900

That'll be for the courts
to decide.

901
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,223
But I didn't do anything.

nothing to worry about.

that's bad enough,

- Mm-hmm.

915
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,022
I'm so very sorry,
Mrs. Foster.

916
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,458
There will be a full-scale
inquiry into the tragedy,

917
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,002
which, sadly, makes it
very difficult for me

918
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,038
to give you any details.

919
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,571
I was at my sister's.

920
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,234
It's such a long way
to come each month,

921
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,743
so I break the journey.

922
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:36,940
That's why I wasn't at home.

923
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,852
Was it his asthma?

924
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:50,426
He's always suffered with it,
since he was a toddler.

925
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,232
No, um, Mrs. Foster,
it wasn't asthma.

926
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,727
I know you weren't on duty
at the time of the hanging,

927
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,575
and since both myself
and the operational director

928
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:09,944
were viewing the prison,

929
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:12,415
the responsibility
is equally shared.

930
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,351
But you do understand,
as governor in charge,

931
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,513
the overall responsibility
is yours.

932
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,057
Yes, I understand.

933
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,324
All four prisoners will remain

934
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,520
segregated at Barfield
until the trial,

935
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,358
which could be anything
up to six months.

936
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,727
So we remain open, then, do we?

937
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,252
OFFICER: Governor's here
to see you, Brinkley.

938
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,972
Well, I've eaten
my dinner last night.

939
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,605
I asked for kippers
for breakfast this morning.

940
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:44,979
Good.

941
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:45,982
You can return to C Wing,

942
