Ah. Governor Langham.

Right, gentlemen, I've asked
to see Winchwood's cell.

As you can see,
the prison services

383

have supplied a scale model
of Barfield,

showing the relationship
of the various wings.

that the governor in charge,

any disciplinary action?

and to the point.

Yes?

391
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,472
Well, I do think
there's some time discrepancy

392
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,269
in the statements
of several of the officers,

393

SIMMS: All these stated
that A Wing...

397

That is, the VP Wing...

398
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,591
Was, at the time
of the first fire, locked.

399
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,820
Yes, continue.

400
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:26,389
Well, if you take
into consideration

401
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,094
the victim's injuries,

402
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,864
he could have been attacked.

403
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,098
SIMMS: But it has not been
verified by the police

404
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,368
that Michael Winchwood
<i>was</i> attacked.

405
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,637
To the contrary, we must accept

406
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,440
that the wounds
were self-inflicted...

407
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,511
Yes, but, sir...

408
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,243
his right and left
wrist artery, throat frontal,

409
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,478
and two chest wounds.

410
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,489
Excessive, I'll agree.

411
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,323
Yes, well, Winchwood, according
to the medical reports,

412
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,953
also received
extensive bruising.

413
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,463
But these have not been proved

414
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,328
to be inflicted
on the night of the riot.

415
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,423
They were in fact...

416
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,611
Do you have the medical report
from his previous prison?

417
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,629
MAN: Winchwood arrived
at Barfield from Hull

418
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,073
two weeks prior to the riot,

419
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,874
with bruising to his abdomen,
back, and buttocks.

420
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:18,008
I think we must move on from the
Winchwood injuries, as I said,

421
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,575
until we have verification
that it was suicide,

422
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,679
and not, for want
of a better word, murder.

423
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,487
I am uppermost interested
in finding out

424
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,789
how and why this riot occurred,

425
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,887
and where the blame
is to be directed.

426
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,398
Miss Hewitt,
I would appreciate it

427
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,764
if you read the file
in your own time.

428
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,531
Please pay attention
to the discussion.

429
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,635
Is the judge going
in his own car or with us?

430
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,644
- Is my car here?
- Mm.

431
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,956
Could you get social services
to make a set of photographs

432
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,642
of Tina's baby?

433
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,308
Because I'm asking you to, Enid.

434
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,217
If necessary,
I'll pay for them myself!

435
00:25:54,286 --> 00:26:00,317
The known ringleaders have been
named and are being dispersed.

436
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,386
However, as there were more than
150 prisoners

437
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:07,194
all admitting to taking part
in the riot,

438
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,859
it would be a time-consuming

439
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,199
and financially punitive
undertaking

440
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,671
to review each man's sentence.

441
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,937
Now, that being said,
I think in time

442
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,945
the ringleaders
must be publicly named

443
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,481
and their sentences
adjusted accordingly.

444
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,647
Governor Langham has agreed
to take an early retirement,

445
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,415
and no disciplinary action
will be taken

446
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,255
against any of
Barfield's officers.

447
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,228
The Home Office pathology report
is being sent by courier.

448
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,788
It is determined
that Michael Winchwood

449
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,130
committed suicide.

450
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,407
HEWITT: Suicide.
It's now been made public.

451
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,306
It is a complete
bloody whitewash.

452
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,868
Not entirely.
Brian Langham's lost his job.

453
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:58,384
Only one record adds...
Here it is...

454
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,180
"Detectives conducting
the inquiry

455
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,663
had previously thought
it was impossible

456
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,349
for a man to sustain
such injuries."

457
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,822
If you had anything
to say about it,

458
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,222
you've missed your opportunity.

459
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,192
I took your advice.

460
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,855
I looked, I listened,
I said nothing.

461
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,761
But I wish I had.

462
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,231
If Michael Winchwood
killed himself,

463
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,360
he was a bloody contortionist.

464
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,199
A moment.

465
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,365
Mr. Bunny...
Barfield's area manager...

466
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,533
You've, uh, met him?

467
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,338
Yes.

468
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,868
He just called
to offer me Barfield Prison.

469
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,278
You gonna take it?

470

Uh, before the riots.

that night, should it?

959

I did the lockup checks
on B Wing about 7:30.

Then I checked all

A few threats?
Would you care to elaborate?

all prisoners on the VP Wing

Yeah, that's right.

On that night, Vernon Black
was in the VP Wing.

Yes, but he's subsequently
been transferred to C Wing.

So he's not
a vulnerable prisoner?

Not anymore.

I think he owed money.
They're not all sex offenders.

I do know that, Mr. Doughen.

I am simply making sure
that Vernon Black was,

Not in person, Murphy.

Come on. You've been in here
over your time.

1095
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,861
You having a problem with that?

1096
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,260
Or are you shitting yourself

1097

because Winchwood's parents
came here?

I'm a doctor.

1101
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,085
I don't know anything
about running a prison,

1102
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,304
and I don't take any sides.

1103
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,040
I just do my job
when I'm called out.

1104
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,914
And I intend to do my job

Well, I'll give you
every assistance I can.

1107
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,213
And you're gonna need it.

Um, listen...

- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1111
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,995
Maybe we could meet again
and discuss drug rehabilitation.

1112
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,144
Sure. You know where I am.
All you need to do is call.

Don, okay if I use the phone?

1114
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:14,869
I can arrange for you to meet

administrator.

Oh, brilliant.

1117

And perhaps we could

I'm on your side, Miss Hewitt.

So, what do you think
of the food here?

It's okay.

1125
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,678
But you work out,
though, don't you?

1126
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,219
Do you think you get
enough protein?

1127
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,812
Yeah, I get in extra.

You get in brought in?

Yeah.
We all do.

No.

Whose face did you sit on?

I didn't hear that.

What other perks do you get?

1139

On the night of the riot,
Mr. Murphy,

1140
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,100
could you tell me what happened?

The night of the riot,
Mr. Murphy.

01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,562
Answer the question.

1151
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,632
Banged up as usual.

1152
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,368
Then the fire started.

1153
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:36,106
They unlocked our spurs,
held us over in the quad.

1154
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:38,607
That's it.

1155
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,548
What time were taken
out of lockup?

1156
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,755
I don't know.
My watch stopped.

1157
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,258
"Prisoner 493, Anthony Murphy,
became violent and abusive."

1158
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,458
That was at 8:30.
Mr. Murphy, is that correct?

1159
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:59,970
I don't know.
My watch stopped.

1160
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,471
- Do you know Michael Winchwood?
- No.

1161
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,598
But you knew who he was?

1162
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,007
Yeah, we knew he was here.

1163
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,273
What did you think of him?

1164
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:13,784
He raped and tortured two little
girls aged nine and seven.

1165
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,787
He buggered an eight-year-old
boy, then buried him.

1166
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,222
So why don't you tell me
what you think about him?

1167
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,953
Did you ever threaten him?

1168
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,757
- Personally? No.
- You didn't?

1169
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,923
You must be the only man here
who didn't.

1170
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,234
Par for the course, isn't it?

1171
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,430
A perverted, twisted animal.

1172
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:37,474
All nonces should be castrated.

1173
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,008
So you did threaten him?

1174
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,010
You're putting words
into my mouth, love.

1175
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,673
I never said I did,
and I never said I didn't.

1176
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:47,240
He topped himself.

1177
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,047
Saves a lot of aggravation.

1178
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,782
Saves the government
a lot of cash.

1179
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:55,690
Costs a grand a week to keep
filth like him segregated.

1180
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,321
Costs almost as much
to keep you too, Mr. Murphy.

1181
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,127
You're new to this job,
aren't you?

1182
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,401
Otherwise you wouldn't bother
wasting your time

with shits like Winchwood.

What time's
this movie starting, then?

1185

Mr. Murphy,
I will treat you with respect

the same rules to me.

your cell and when I leave.

straightaway.

Choose a few number of officers
to do the strip searches.

all the officers for the cinema.

C Wing is priority, then D Wing.

We've got to keep them in
the cinema as long as possible.

We've got a good two hours
to do the strip search.

I don't think she has any idea

should have been allowed
such privileges.

1434
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,099
They could lock us out.

They could do
whatever they want in there.

he'll be needing a fix.

Winchwood's belongings.

Did you want me?

you told me
you were on the VP Wing.

01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:11,279
And when the fire started
you were locked in your cell.

Did you begin one of the fires
the night Winchwood was killed?

Officer Doughen,
would you wait over there!

1467
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,903
What's the matter
with you, Vernon? Are you sick?

1468

Are you running a temperature?

But I might.

1472

I want to go back closer
to where me mum can visit me.

- It's been over a month.

So you lied to me.

1478
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,395
You told me you were on the
VP Wing because you owed money,

which you were able to pay back
after your last visit.

on the night of the fire,

were you locked in your cell?

did you see anything?

Take him back to his cell.

1485
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,663
He shouldn't be in metalwork
in his condition.

1486
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,495
Michael Winchwood
had a radio/CD player,

inmates' possessions lists.

This is ridiculous.
You know the rules.

Every prisoner must list
his personal possessions.

could be a murder inquiry.

1555

1564

afraid of, Vernon?

Murphy and Jellings
or certain prison officers?

01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,946
I don't smoke.

1578
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:04,789
Well, Michael Winchwood
used to taunt us,

1579
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:07,488
taunt the other prisoners.

1580
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,394
He's been made out to be
some kind of victim,

1581
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,834
but in reality the man was
a perverted, twisted bastard!

1582
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:16,235
O'KEEFE: He wasn't like
the other segregated nonces.

1583
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,241
He was always sort of gloating,
like he was somehow superior,

1584
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,800
playing his classical music,
his opera.

1585
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,608
- Get to the point.
- Tom's got two kids.

1586
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:30,118
Winchwood used to keep on
about what he'd do to them.

1587
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:33,587
I was bathing my little boy,

1588
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,682
and I drew the curtains 'cause
I didn't want anyone to see me

1589
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:39,125
holding me own little boy.

1590
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:41,129
That's what Winchwood did to me.

1591
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:43,893
We just wanted to shut him up,
make him scared.

1592
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,332
We knew we couldn't do it.

1593
01:31:48,136 --> 01:31:50,469
So you used Murphy and Jellings.

1594
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,474
We wanted to talk to you,
to tell you, ask you if you'd...

1595
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,635
Look...

1596
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,475
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me, and the answer is no.

1597
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,745
There's been enough covering up.

1598
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:04,217
If Murphy and Jellings
killed Winchwood,

1599
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:07,619
then he has a right to justice.

1600

a lesson, nothing more.

Oh, but it was more, wasn't it?
It was a lot more.

for you, didn't he?

01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,875
No?

1606
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,779
