ï»¿1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,532
Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:08,269
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,401
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,810
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,281
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,012
Lockup!
Lockup!

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,762
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,847
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,289
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,692
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,286
Bastards.

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,231
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,828
Shoot! Shoot!

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,019
There you are.
I told you I knew him, didn't I?

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,069
He's my mate.
Tarzan!

16
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:49,674
Tarzan!
Tarzan! Tarzan!

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,187
I won't talk to anyone
but the frigging governor!

18
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,688
I want my mother!

19
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,281
I want a blow-up rubber doll!

20
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,485
He wants a blow-up rubber doll.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,190
Mm-hmm.
And to see you blowing it up.

22
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,661
He's out.
Is he out? Gary?

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,260
Can you stand?

24
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,741
I'm just a bit stiff.

27
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,456
Oh, good morning.

28
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,926
Sorry.

29
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,054
Hi.
How's Russell Morgan?

30
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,062
Oh, he's fine.

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,463
He insisted on returning to duty
after a few days.

32
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,365
After you.

33
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,629
Helen Hewitt.
Prison board.

34
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,038
These hostage situations,

35
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,018
they have a kind of
whiplash effect, do you know?

36
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,587
He's an old pro.
We just get on with it.

37
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,772
It's like falling off a bike.

38
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,677
Well, frankly, I don't think
it's that simple,

39
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,477
but I hope you prove me wrong.

40
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,303
- You cut me off, bastard!
- Piss off!

41
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,990
You want to look
where you're going, pal!

42
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,656
- Hey, do you hear me?
- Piss off!

43
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,633
You cut me off back there!

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,861
Piss off!

45
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,943
You stupid git.
What's your problem?

46
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,279
You think you can ride roughshod
over people, pal.

47
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,045
Well, you've picked
the wrong one.

48
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,609
Bastard!

49
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,019
- Bastard!
- Bugger off.

50
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,620
Bugger off.
Get out of here.

51
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,770
What's going on up there?

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,069
All right, mate?

53
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,237
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

54
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,304
Move your ruddy bike, then.

55
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,247
<i>I'm gonna start
messing with him!</i>

56
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,775
<i>I mean it!
I'm gonna start cutting him!</i>

57
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,588
- What happened to Mavis?
- Contract wasn't renewed.

58
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,789
Governor Keller brought in
a load of new staff.

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,092
Here you go.

60
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,834
Keller wasn't here, you know,
when it went down.

61
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,808
Oh, he says he was,
but he was playing golf.

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,037
His secretary, Mrs. Gill,
covered for him.

63
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,306
How do you know?

64
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,543
I know one of the stewards.
He told me.

65
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,413
- Miss Hewitt, good morning.
- Morning.

66
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,084
I'm to take you through
to the boardroom.

67
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,052
- Okay.
- Want me with you?

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,021
No, you'll be called
when you're required.

69
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,352
Miss Hewitt.

70
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,492
Yeah.

71
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,139
Mr. Marshall, could I have
a moment, please?

72
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,029
Sure, Miss Bullock.

73
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,123
That was Helen Hewitt.

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,396
She was overseeing Barfield
during the rebuilding.

75
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,461
Oh.
What's she here for?

76
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,063
HQ are here to discuss
the hostage situation

77
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,484
that went down
a couple of weeks ago.

78
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,286
I just want to run past you

79
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,620
the rehearsal schedule
for the musical.

80
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,577
Sorry.

81
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,843
Yeah, Marshall.
Yeah, hang on.

82
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,508
Yeah, he's supposed to be
on duty.

83
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,021
Okay, I'll get someone
to call his home.

84
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,255
Margaret, will you call
Russell Morgan's home,

85
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,364
see if he's on his way in?

86
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,121
Only they're expecting him
in the boardroom.

87
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,025
Oh, and get back to me
on it, yeah?

88
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,154
Thanks.

89
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,030
This is a list of the inmates
that want to be involved.

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,728
- It's a musical, isn't it?
- Yes.

91
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,431
And I need Kevin Watts,
prisoner 678, C Wing.

92
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,803
He said he can play the piano.

93
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,951
Okay, I'll get this lot
checked out with head office.

94
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,534
Thank you.

95
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,273
I instructed prison routine
to continue as normal,

96
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,076
staff to go about their duties,

97
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,344
except for
the known trained negotiators.

98
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,442
Doctor to be in attendance.

99
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,886
Clear all inmates
from around the hostage cell.

100
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,480
Screen the area,
set up surveillance equipment.

101
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,356
Works governor to be brought in
to advise if necessary...

102
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,689
Cell construction.

103
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,627
And door jack to be at hand.

104
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:01,999
And the C-and-R squad to deploy,
fully kitted but out of sight.

105
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,798
Under the circumstances,

106
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,149
I don't think there was anything
else I could have instigated.

107
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,268
Oh, Barfield's
head of psychology

108
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,972
was unfortunately at
Newgate House with Miss Hewitt.

109
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,515
Please, Gordon,
this is not an inquiry.

110
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,778
We just like all the facts.

111
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,614
Miss Hewitt.

112
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,244
Damn well feels like it.

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,482
My main observation

114
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,787
is that there were too many
people in silver command,

115
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,588
trying to be helpful

116
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,323
but nevertheless
an unnecessary presence.

117
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,092
Excuse me, Miss Hewitt.

118
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,293
S.O. Russell Morgan
hasn't turned up for work.

119
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,836
Phoned his home,
but there's no reply.

120
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,032
Check up where the hell he is.
We need him here.

121
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,132
It's the entire point
of the meeting.

122
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,304
Very confusing to
know exactly who was doing what.

123
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,279
I agree with Dr. Harris.

124
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,509
I mean, I was receiving
duplicate information

125
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,711
from two different officers
in the healthcare center.

126
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,014
So it would be helpful if...

127
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,490
Mr. Keller, are you aware of the
new procedures instigated by HQ?

128
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,585
Barfield is severely lacking
in trained negotiating officers.

129
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,654
In a prison of this size, that
should have been a priority.

130
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,222
I did what I could

131
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,098
as soon as I was informed
we had a hostage situation.

132
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:09,966
Now, that was not...

133
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,234
Mr. Keller, we are not here
to apportion any blame.

134
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,105
Miss Hewitt has kindly agreed
to join us again.

135
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,077
As you know,
she was instrumental

136
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,113
in releasing Mr. Morgan,

137
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,241
so she is obviously familiar
with siege and hostage training.

138
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,310
Miss Hewitt has a hidden agenda.

139
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,787
Ah, coffee.
Good.

140
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,589
Then I think we'll adjourn
to the healthcare center.

141
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,592
Shall I be mother?

142
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,189
Coffee?

143
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,375
I think he's drunk.

144
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,215
Ja-son.

145
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,946
- Ja-son.
- Cut that out. Sit down.

146
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,989
Go on, sit down.
Front row.

147
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,082
C Wing inmates.
For one hour.

148
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,663
Quiet.
Quiet, please.

149
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,289
Eric, Roddy.

150
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,561
Hand out these music sheets.

151
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,034
All I'll do this morning

152
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,039
is start auditioning
for named roles and chorus.

153
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,507
Let's settle down.
Come on.

154
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,306
Those chosen to be in the show
with leading roles will get...

155
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,643
Quiet! Quiet!

156
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,445
Special privileges of three
rehearsal periods a week

157
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,281
and will be excused workshop.

158
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,651
Miss Bollock, I'm going...

159
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,851
Miss Bullock.

160
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,053
Don't tell her anyway.

161
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,425
You've got two more weeks.

162
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,373
I'm going out. I won't be here
for the first night.

163
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,059
Yeah, but you're
getting out of workshop.

164
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,658
- Quiet! Quiet!
- You's right.

165
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,603
Sorry, we were just wondering
who was gonna go soprano.

166
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,316
Will you come up
on the stage, please, Brian?

167
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,935
I never did anything Miss Bull...
Miss Bollock... Bullock.

168
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,672
I want to hear you sing, Brian.

169
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,941
- Oooh!
- Oooh!

170
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,814
Play the first few bars
of the opening song, Kevin.

171
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,798
Why, yes, give me a C, boy!

172
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,477
Need to get some practice in,
Miss Bullock.

173
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,388
All right?

174
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,663
<i>I mean it!
I'm gonna start cutting him!</i>

175
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,799
Transferral of a prisoner,

176
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,774
was not available
to S.O. Russell Morgan.

177
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,241
The nominal index card,

178
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,820
the prisoner's
long-term allocation report,

179
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,039
OCA Birmingham,

180
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,047
his reallocation report,
OCA Wandsworth,

181
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,207
and his security sheet...

182
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,493
Apparently remained
at reception.

183
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,418
I wasn't given
any details whatsoever,

184
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,783
apart from his medical reports.

185
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,221
So at no time... Dr. Harris,
at no time were you made aware

186
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,952
or any of the staff on duty
that morning

187
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,221
that the inmate George Falla
was extremely dangerous?

188
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,905
Didn't take us long
to find out, Miss Hewitt.

189
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,862
I'm sure it didn't,

190
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,541
since he was threatening
to kill the hostage,

191
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,675
and according to this report,

192
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,744
there was a belief that
he would carry out that threat.

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,829
I'm sorry, but we're still
unable to contact S.O. Morgan.

194
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,396
Keep trying.
I want him here.

195
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,704
Dr. Harris.

196
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,609
When you examined Mr. Morgan,
was he in good shape?

197
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,840
Well, he had a bad nick
to the side of his neck,

198
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,246
and his neck was also bruised

199
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,284
from where the noose
had been tied 'round it.

200
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,377
Both wrists had signs
of burn-type bruising.

201
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,389
No, no, no.
I meant his mental state.

202
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,322
Fine.
Appeared absolutely fine.

203
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,257
Look, is this going to
go on much longer.

204
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,794
I've got my morning rounds
to do.

205
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,421
Right, I don't think there's any
need to delay you any longer.

206
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,430
Thanks.

207
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,399
Mr. Keller,
I meant Dr. Harris.

208
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,993
Do you mind if we just take up
another half hour or so?

209
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,130
I'm beginning to mind.

210
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:10,701
If I'm going to be subjected
to this kind of scrutiny,

211
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,508
then you will get
my resignation.

212
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,826
I do not know of anything more
I could have done!

213
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,957
Senior Officer Morgan
returned to work

214
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,468
three days after the incident
of his own volition,

215
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,468
so I don't think...

216
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,096
Did you set up
a care-bear support team?

217
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,332
Care bear.

218
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,840
HQ have
a post-incident support team

219
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,139
for counseling
within the service for staff.

220
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,769
Officer Morgan
returned to duties

221
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,371
and without any ill effects.

222
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,381
Now, I'm sorry,

223
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,317
but I've got three adjudications
this morning,

224
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,149
so if there is anything else,

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,712
could we leave it
to another time?

226
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,988
Most unfortunate that Mr. Morgan
wasn't present this morning.

227
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,393
Thank you very much for
your cooperation, Mr. Keller.

228
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,455
Just one more thing, Mr. Keller.

229
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,830
According to the logbook,

230
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,310
there was
almost over an hour's delay

231
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,735
before you actually instigated
the silver and bronze teams.

232
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,101
Now, was there
a reason for this?

233
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,908
Well, you were actually here
at Barfield, weren't you?

234
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,406
Yes, Miss Hewitt.

235
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,075
I was.

236
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,413
I have to report to HQ,

237
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,513
but I'd like to see the prison
chaplain before I leave.

238
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,296
No, no, Kevin!

239
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,100
Look, if you hum it again,
I can usually pick up anything.

240
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,903
Well, can't you sight-read
anything at all?

241
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:49,975
I'm sorry, Miss Bullock,

242
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,954
I'm gonna have to take Mr. Watts
back to the wing.

243
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,914
They're serving lunch
in 10 minutes.

244
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,109
We've got more tone-deaf inmates
on C Wing

245
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,277
than we have on D and E,
and I'm beginning to think

246
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,911
it could be the fault
of my pianist.

247
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,115
Miss Bullock,
have you met Helen Hewitt?

248
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,782
No.
I saw you earlier.

249
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,883
- How do you do?
- I'm a psychologist.

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,394
Ah, yes,
you work with Dr. Williams.

251
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,724
- Yes.
- Is he back here yet?

252
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,925
No, his wife's suffering
from postnatal depression.

253
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,661
Oh.

254
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,965
Well, nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.

255
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,406
Governor Keller did say
that he was here at Barfield

256
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,602
at the time the hostage incident
started, didn't he?

257
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,144
Yes, he did.

258
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,806
I think you'll find he was
not even in the building.

259
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,450
Mr. Fuller,
this is Helen Hewitt.

260
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,757
She'd like to talk to you.
She's from the Prison Service.

261
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,482
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

262
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,766
Would you escort Miss Hewitt
back to the office area, please?

263
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,088
I do know the way, Mr. Bunny.

264
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:43,357
I daresay you do.
It's security.

265
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,107
Could we go into your office,
do you think?

266
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,360
Oh, yes, yes.
It's this way.

267
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,512
I know.
I used to work here.

268
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,036
Oh, really?
Doing what exactly?

269
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,366
Governor.

270
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,841
I can see I'm gonna miss
this culinary expertise.

271
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,570
What is?
Fatty?

272
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,613
I don't know.
Spotted dick and custard.

273
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,307
If you don't want yours,
I'll have it.

274
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,925
Hey, Roddy, for a bloke
who ate his granny,

275
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,159
it's no wonder
you're not choosy.

276
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,812
Who told him?
Who told him about me?

277
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,253
I'll get him.

278
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,332
What are you doing serving

279
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,722
steak and kidney pie
on a Tuesday?

280
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,659
I'm gonna complain about this.

281
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,822
Come on, hurry up.
I've got a letter to write.

282
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,924
Brian, I said hum any tune...
Any tune...

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,468
And I can usually pick it up.

284
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,471
She never asked
if I could read music.

285
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,182
What have we got
steak and kidney on today for?

286
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,538
Jason!

287
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,304
Hey! Jason! Jason?

288
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,309
Jason!

289
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,074
Keeps on doing it,
all day, all night.

290
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,547
I don't know why.
Why does he do it?

291
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,106
Just to aggravate you, son.

292
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,618
- Any word on S.O. Morgan?
- Nope, not since I've been here.

293
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,951
- Come on, Eugene.
- All right, Bri!

294
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,287
Oswald Snooper!
Back to your cell, please.

295
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,452
Yo, gov.
I've got a complaint.

296
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,538
They're serving the wrong food
on the wrong day here.

297
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,030
You, you should be pleased,
mate.

298
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,622
You always complain
about the boredom.

299
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,739
This is keeping you happy.

300
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,029
Piss off.

301
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,433
Oh! Oh, oh.
That's funny.

302
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,232
Woof!

303
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,603
Oi, Eugene,
has he got it in for me?

304
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,574
Why does he keep on
calling out my name?

305
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,975
I don't know.
It's your name, innit? Jason.

306
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,044
Yeah, right.

307
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,890
Why does
he keep calling out my name?

308
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:12,716
So I stayed with Mrs. Morgan...
Uh, her name's Nora...

309
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,381
Until, well, very late.

310
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,049
Well, until her husband
was released.

311
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,615
And you haven't seen her again?

312
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,389
No, I-I said she should call me
if she needed me.

313
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,022
And you haven't spoken
to Senior Officer Morgan

314
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,430
since the incident?

315
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,627
No, no, I haven't, actually.

316
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,261
Um, well,
he's a very experienced officer

317
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,273
and I doubt if there's anything
to be unduly worried about.

318
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm sure there isn't.

319
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,470
But, you know, there should be
a hostage-support scheme.

320
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,014
Well, there isn't one, is there?

321
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,949
Well, no, uh, I don't think so.

322
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,883
Um, well, I do agree.

323
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,513
One should have been instigated
by Mr. Keller.

324
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,822
He hasn't exactly instilled, um,
too much confidence.

325
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,362
There was a lot of ill feeling
about his delaying

326
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,762
coming to grips
with this hostage situation.

327
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,391
Well, thanks for the coffee.

328
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,231
On the day
of the hostage incident,

329
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,033
Governor Keller
was at a management conference.

330
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,437
Really?

331
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,907
And they usually take place

332
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:13,106
on the ninth hole
of a golf course, do they?

333
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,239
According to all the reports
the doctor,

334
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,014
even without much experience,
proved to be an able negotiator.

335
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,086
The perpetrator,

336
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,488
according to the control room
log and the incident area log,

337
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,618
refused to speak to any of
the negotiators, full stop.

338
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,457
Said he didn't trust them.

339
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,054
Now, possibly
if I hadn't have arrived,

340
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,257
they would have provided him

341
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,976
with the blow-up rubber dolly
he requested.

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,060
I am only here to ensure

343
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,627
that should such an incident
occur again,

344
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,264
then any mistakes that were made
will be rectified.

345
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,070
If you've anything
further to add...

346
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,873
Yes, you could start by making
all prison staff more aware

347
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,675
of the hostage
and siege programs.

348
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,547
Perhaps you could even get
the acting governor

349
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,073
to take a refresher course, hmm?

350
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,086
Do you want to know
where S.O. Russell Morgan is?

351
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,247
He's in
the emergency psychiatric ward

352
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,553
of the local hospital.

353
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,990
Now, you'd better take

354
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,221
my accusations seriously,
Mr. Bunny,

355
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,424
or I'll have every governor,
officer, at Barfield Prison

356
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,433
to sign a petition
and vote him out.

357
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,093
Just calm down.

358
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,694
This isn't gonna be
brushed under the carpet.

359
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,640
If HQ try it,
you'll have a riot.

360
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,439
Only not from the inmates.

361
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,109
If there is to be a petition,
then I think my observations

362
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,846
should be
taken into consideration.

363
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,889
Perhaps you have
a personal motive, Miss Hewitt?

364
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,324
This isn't personal.
That is my professional opinion.

365
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Just as I presume
that you had no personal motive

366
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,392
when you felt
that I was too inexperienced

367
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,797
to continue running Barfield.

368
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,294
Well, I hope you don't retain

369
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,272
any personal motives against me,
Mr. Bunny.

370
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,036
Your own inexperience
in handling a siege situation

371
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,442
might possibly
come under scrutiny.

372
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,209
You'll get copies of my report.
Good morning.

373
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,305
Morning.

374
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,656
Full of herself, isn't she?

375
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,216
There's a vote of no confidence,
Gordon,

376
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,558
and I don't think I can stop it.

377
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,427
Or her.

378
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,162
Tarzan!

379
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,034
Tarzan!
Tarzan, it's me... Brian.

380
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,771
You remember me.
I was in the block with you.

381
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,484
We're doing a musical.
They've got... aah!

382
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,243
Aah! Eugene!
He's pulling me hair out!

383
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,580
Glasses!

384
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,586
No one's scared of you, Tarzan!

385
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,053
Oh!

386
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,454
- Oh, your glasses, Eugene!
- Jesus.

387
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,253
Broken.
Your new glasses.

388
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,055
Get a move on!
Show's over.

389
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,254
Bastards.

390
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,524
I'll be glad when I get out of
this shithole!

391
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,032
Be glad when you go as well.
Your moaning and your whingeing.

392
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,034
You'll be sick
when I'm gone, Eugene.

393
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,296
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

394
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,271
You'll be sick about me too,
because in two weeks, I gone.

395
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,365
Yeah, man, we'll meet up
and have a curry.

396
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,000
- Boom!
- Yes, boy!

397
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,675
Thank you.

398
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,946
Hello.

399
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,284
Been a long time.
Do sit down.

400
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,288
Thank you.

401
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,984
Can I offer you some coffee
or tea?

402
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,994
No.
Nothing, thank you.

403
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,360
Did you enjoy your time
in the United States?

404
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,693
Well, I don't whether "enjoy"

405
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,642
is quite the word I would've
used to describe it,

406
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,786
but it was very informative.

407
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,826
I've been back
almost six months.

408
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,596
You must be aware
of why you're here.

409
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,038
Mm-hmm.

410
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,908
Governor Keller implemented
a number of changes,

411
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,244
some of which were not
as successful as others,

412
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,307
and Barfield
could possibly be market tested.

413
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,447
Um, this is
not yet public knowledge,

414
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,458
but Governor Keller
has resigned,

415
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,120
and until
we have time to replace him,

416
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,255
the position
of governor of Barfield

417
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,664
would be a transitory posting.

418
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,465
Mr. Andrews,

419
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,337
I'm obviously very grateful
for the research opportunities,

420
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,807
and teaching
at the training college

421
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,036
has been very satisfactory,

422
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,012
but I am not interested
in any transitory posting.

423
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,012
No, no, no.

424
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,207
I-I think we're slightly

425
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,943
at cross purposes here,
Miss Hewitt.

426
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,486
I'm not offering you
a transitory post.

427
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,812
Oh.

428
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,687
With your experience
and interest

429
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,268
in the psychology
of serious offenders,

430
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,491
together with your training
in the U.S.,

431
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,361
I want to ask you to take over

432
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,833
the psychology department
of Barfield.

433
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,038
Um...

434
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,543
Uh, I misunderstood.

435
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,577
Uh, Mr. Andrews, I don't want to
head any psychology department.

436
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,087
I would have liked
to have returned to Barfield

437
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,454
as governor,
not on any transitory contract,

438
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,584
but with a guarantee
that I would be there

439
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,252
for a minimum of three years.

440
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,956
Well, there is a short list
being drawn up.

441
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,731
I'm sorry, Mr. Andrews.

442
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,464
But your offer clearly indicates

443
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,476
where you feel my experience
would be most advantageous,

444
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,603
and it is not what I envisage
for my future.

445
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,510
Therefore you leave me
no alternative

446
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,674
but to resign
from the Prison Service.

447
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,688
Bugger.

448
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,106
I'm sorry, but Mr. Morgan
is in the Edith Cavell room.

449
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,371
Thank you.

450
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,319
Nora!

451
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,821
They sent me to the wrong ward.

452
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,517
And I'm sorry
I couldn't get here before.

453
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,287
I was on duty.

454
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,021
How is he?

455
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,154
He wants to come home.

456
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,663
Oh, I don't know what to do.

457
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,866
I've already had to
take time off work.

458
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,272
I knew something
was gonna happen.

459
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,675
I just knew it.

460
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,303
What do the doctors say?

461
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,813
You know Russell.

462
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,350
They walk in,
and he puts on a big act.

463
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,614
The moment they walk out,
it's...

464
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,623
He doesn't seem to be able
to stop crying.

465
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,819
They've given him something
for depression today.

466
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,922
He's not been himself.

467
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,934
He won't talk to me and...

468
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,526
Why didn't you call me?

469
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,299
Because he didn't want
anyone to know.

470
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,341
Typical.

471
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,571
He's ashamed to admit there's
anything wrong with him.

472
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:57,540
He won't admit it, and when
he does talk to me, he's...

473
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,378
He can get really nasty.

474
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,849
As if it's all my fault.

475
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,724
I'm a bit scared of him, Gary.

476
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,331
I don't know what to do.

477
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,964
Hey. Come here.

478
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,466
I'll go and have a chat to him,

479
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,600
and you wait
down in the coffee bar for me.

480
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,338
- All right?
- Mm.

481
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,674
Good girl.

482
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,407
Go on.

483
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,943
Okay, time's up.

484
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,354
Right, you have a prisoner

485
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,414
sent to the hospital wing
on transferral,

486
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,322
and he takes an officer hostage
in his cell.

487
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,021
Let's start with you.
List two errors.

488
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,293
Well, uh, it shows the
importance of being aware

489
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,632
from the transferrals arrival,
that you have his prison record.

490
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,934
If it was known
he was a dangerous prisoner...

491
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,098
Excuse me.

492
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,369
Miss Stapleton.

493
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,434
Would you let us all
join in your conversation?

494
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,411
It was nothing important.

495
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,777
Really?

496
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,112
So what we're discussing here
is not important?

497
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,462
Well, let me tell you
that everything you learn here

498
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,455
is of utmost importance.

499
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,514
You will be taking care...
And believe me, it is care...

500
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,119
Of men and women whose lives
are your responsibility.

501
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,732
Okay, take 15.
No more.

502
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,043
Good morning.
Ah, good, you're here.

503
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,840
We have a session
after coffee break.

504
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,005
Yep.

505
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,138
How's Susan?

506
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,275
She cries if I look at her,
but the baby's fine.

507
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,945
So you're not going back
to Barfield?

508
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,283
Yeah, of course.

509
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,482
I'm only on a sort of
an extended maternity leave.

510
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,922
We get it now, you know,
as well.

511
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,064
Well, I think you'll find
it's more than extended.

512
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,566
I was just offered your job.

513
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,067
What?

514
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,660
It's all right.
I turned it down.

515
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,103
Well, no, it's not all right.

516
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,834
And I will not be made
the scapegoat

517
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,500
for Gordon Keller's cock-ups.

518
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,771
For goodness' sake,
this hostage wasn't the first.

519
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,312
What, did <i>he</i> offer you
my position?

520
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,904
No, Mr. Andrews at HQ.

521
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,325
Then do you mind
if I take this up with him?

522
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,783
Not at all.

523
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,682
And I were you,
I'd make him fully aware

524
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,119
of whatever else
is wrong at Barfield.

525
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,727
Just be delayed reaction,
that's all.

526
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,322
Well, they haven't found
anything serious, have they?

527
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,866
And you look well.

528
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,100
I'd better get a move on.
Is there anything you need?

529
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:39,509
I just need a good night's kip,
that's all.

530
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,343
I'm not sleeping, you see?
I can't sleep.

531
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,747
Well, then, lay back now.

532
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,286
Come on.
Get your head down.

533
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,912
Come on.
Lift up.

534
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,426
There you go.

535
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,259
Now, I'll come back again
tomorrow, yeah?

536
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,855
Put your grapes there,

537
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,901
and I'll get one of the nurses
to bring a vase in

538
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,230
to put the flowers in.

539
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,361
All right?

540
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:12,976
I haven't let them down once,
not in 15 years.

541
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,446
I'll be back on the wing
this afternoon.

542
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,983
You tell 'em.
You make sure they know.

543
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,076
Russell, Russell.

544
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,917
They already know that, son.

545
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,618
But why don't you grab
forty winks now, hmm?

546
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,921
Hmm?

547
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,154
Come on.

548
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,166
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

549
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,647
Miss Purvis.

550
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,817
âª A wand'ring minstrel I... âª

551
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,028
No, no, no.

552
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,258
- Are you in charge?
- Hey!

553
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,562
That's it. That's enough.
And again.

554
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,866
One, two, three, four

555
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,304
âª A wand'ring minstrel I... âª

556
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,433
âª A thing of shreds... âª

557
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,067
You go.

558
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,975
âª ...of ballads, songs... âª

559
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,876
Miss Bullock.

560
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,006
Have you cast
any of the staff yet?

561
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,243
Only I'd like to audition.

562
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,252
Oh, good, but can you wait till
after rehearsal, Curtis, okay?

563
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,254
All right, thanks.

564
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,290
You wait for my nod
before you turn the page.

565
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,791
You're doing very well. It's
just you're a little bit fast.

566
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,699
Gilbert and Sullivan
is quite tricky, you know?

567
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,992
Ohh.
I do apologize.

568
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,827
Okay, and again.

569
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,426
So go on now, boy, tell me...
How much you asking?

570
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,733
It's high grade.
This is Â£10 a crystal.

571
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,639
And I can
keep the supply coming.

572
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,438
Why, it was a joke, yes?

573
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,810
10 quid a crystal?
I was selling rocks for five.

574
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,348
Well, take it
or leave it, Snoopy.

575
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,008
But you ain't ever had gear
this good.

576
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,075
There's crack,
and there's <i>crack.</i>

577
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,063
You'll make some readies
with this before you get out.

578
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:06,252
No, no, no, no.
That stuff makes me go crazy.

579
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,988
And me no want no trouble, boy.

580
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,927
'Cause in ten days, I'm walking.

581
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,095
Brian.

582
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,691
Well, what's the matter
with you?

583
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,962
You're not singing anything.

584
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,971
It's a waste of time anyway.
He gets released next week.

585
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,700
He won't be here for the show.

586
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,503
- Is that true, Brian?
- Yeah.

587
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,753
Well, what are you wasting my
time and everybody's time for?

588
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,040
How many rocks you got?

589
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,156
Take Brian back to the wing.

590
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,446
- Nice one, Eugene.
- How many do you want?

591
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,248
Snoopy, come up here now.

592
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,879
Miss Purvis, please stand by.

593
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Where do you want me?

594
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,592
There.

595
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,663
And...

596
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,899
One, two, three, four.

597
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,597
âª A wand'ring minstrel I... âª

598
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,664
âª A thing of shreds
and patches âª

599
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,802
âª Of ballads, songs,
and snatches âª

600
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,870
âª And dreamy lullaby âª

601
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,678
You are talking bullshit!
How can you rape a tart?

602
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,981
How can you rape a woman
who trades sex for cash?

603
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,489
Mr. Jones, you were charged
with forcing your victim

604
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,754
into giving you
oral satisfaction.

605
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,488
The victim said she did not want
to get into your car.

606
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:20,363
You threatened her and then
forced her to give you oral sex.

607
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,661
You then became violent.

608
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,430
I admitted that.
I did pick the slag up.

609
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,597
She was on the game, right?

610
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:29,904
I've had enough of this.
I'm not wasting any more time.

611
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,238
Right.
Thank you.

612
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,505
Officer Henley, very good.

613
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,844
Not very impressive from you.

614
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,009
Miss Stapleton, did you read
the prisoner's case history?

615
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,849
Yeah. Three previous convictions
for rape.

616
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,288
So, he's committed the same
offense, not once, not twice,

617
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,791
but three times, correct?

618
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,987
Been sentenced three times,
rape of prostitutes,

619
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,031
in each rape
using excessive violence

620
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,259
when they refused
to give oral satisfaction

621
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,665
and have unprotected sex...

622
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,629
Okay.

623
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,572
So starting off
discussing oral sex

624
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,404
wasn't really advisable, was it?

625
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,034
You should have
tried to discover

626
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,204
why he doesn't see prostitutes
as women.

627
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,043
Could you take over
for a minute, Jim?

628
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,744
Hi.
Have you seen Mr. Andrews?

629
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,080
Yeah.
Can you cover for me here?

630
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,676
Sure, if you put in
a good word for me.

631
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,415
Hey, I'm trying to
hang onto my job here.

632
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,286
Anyway, I thought you said
you resigned.

633
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,223
I'm not after your job,
just Keller's.

634
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,732
Now, listen,
do you want some advice?

635
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,661
Threaten to go to the press.

636
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,358
Right now
they don't want that in any way.

637
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,797
Better get back
to Miss Stapleton.

638
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,097
She just blew the oral sex case.
Good luck.

639
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,363
Cheers.

640
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:41,707
âª On a tree by a river,
a little tom-tit âª

641
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,241
âª Sang "Willow, titwillow,
titwillow!" âª

642
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,015
âª And I said to him,
"Dicky-bird..." âª

643
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,921
Curtis, this is your copy,
if you'd like to look over it.

644
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,824
- Snoopy?
- Come on, now.

645
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,903
Is Mr. Oswald here?

646
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,905
Those not wanted
on the stage, please move out.

647
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,862
Snoopy?

648
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,799
- Come on.
- Oh.

649
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:03,908
We're a bit short of time,

650
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,801
and I'm sorry
you've been left hanging about.

651
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,466
Ohh, you've been
asking for this.

652
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,270
Aah!

653
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,935
Oh! Aah!

654
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,342
I can sing that!

655
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,677
Shut your mouth, bitch.

656
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:21,709
âª He slapped at his chest
as he sat on that bough âª

657
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:26,282
âª Singing, "Willow, titwillow,
titwillow!" âª

658
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:31,023
âª And a cold perspiration
bespangled his brow âª

659
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:35,295
âª Oh, willow, titwillow,
titwillow! âª

660
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:40,635
âª And he sobbed and he sighed,
and a gurgle he gave âª

661
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:45,838
âª Then he plunged himself
into that billowy wave âª

662
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:52,374
âª And an echo arose
from the suicide's grave âª

663
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:57,822
âª "Oh, willow, titwillow,
titwillow!" âª

664
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:05,889
âª Now, I feel just as sure
as I'm sure that my name âª

665
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,262
âª Isn't Willow... âª

666
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,766
Aah!

667
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,934
Come here, Snoopy.

668
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,835
- Pack it in.
- Big man now.

669
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,840
Get up here.
Get up here.

670
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,452
I'm warning you!

671
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,104
Aah!

672
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,848
Ah, he bit me!
Bastard!

673
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,611
Get him downstairs!

674
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,293
Better get a medic
up here quick.

675
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,421
Fast.

676
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,035
What's going on, Reg?

677
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,305
I've asked, we've all asked,
and he won't shut up.

678
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:57,076
He says he wants raw vegetables,
raw meat, and, uh, bananas,

679
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,811
but, then,
he was doing his ape man.

680
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,587
Victor?
Will you stop messing about?

681
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,386
You're getting
on everyone's nerves.

682
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,859
Victor!

683
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,860
Victor!

684
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,089
Me Tarzan!

685
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,826
Well, I'm not your bloody Jane,
so shut up!

686
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,802
If you don't like the food,
put in an official complaint.

687
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,505
He's crazy.
He should be in Broadmoor.

688
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,108
Victor.

689
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,142
You keep this up, son,

690
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,543
and you're going
to the isolation unit.

691
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,348
Tarzan. Tarzan.

692
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,680
Tarzan!

693
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,952
That's his new llama technique.

694
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,289
I've already tasted it.
He's playing around with us.

695
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,885
Hey, you, Marshall.

696
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,296
Dickhead.
I want to talk to you.

697
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,300
- You there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

698
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,929
Listen, I've got a visitor.

699
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,438
Who is it, Nelly the Elephant?

700
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,877
Not it's not Nelly, no.
It's me dad.

701
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,310
I want to see me dad.

702
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,415
Can you fix that for me,
Marshall?

703
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,455
Will you put your clothes on
for him?

704
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,319
Yeah.

705
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,391
Okay. Okay.

706
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,137
Keep it moving.

707
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,161
Keep it moving.

708
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,796
Get off!

709
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,267
Get that cell open now!

710
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,429
Easy, easy.

711
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,081
Take him 'round.
Take him 'round.

712
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,105
Keep him moving!

713
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,267
Search him!
Search that bastard!

714
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,141
Look at this.
That bastard bit me all over.

715
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,278
Snoopy!

716
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,925
I haven't seen him like this
in three years.

717
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,882
What the hell is he on?

718
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,545
Hey, whatever it is,
I'd love some of it!

719
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,851
It's Miss Bullock.
She's in a bad way.

720
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,289
Right, Governor Syons
is calling the local Bill.

721
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,328
We sealed off the cinema
as a crime area.

722
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,296
He raped her.
He raped her!

723
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,832
You'll have to go
and see Doc Harris.

724
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,959
- What?
- Found this. It's crack.

725
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,012
- Where did you find it?
- It was in his tracksuit.

726
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,097
- Get off and see Doc Harris.
- We got problems.

727
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,283
Dr. Williams has gone to HQ.

728
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,452
I said he wasn't here, and they
asked to be put through to you.

729
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,537
It's Barfield's HOC,
Gary Marshall.

730
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,248
Gary.

731
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,808
Miss Hewitt, we've had a rape.

732
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,118
Is it possible
for you to come to Barfield?

733
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,885
No. Sorry.

734
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,018
But you were called in
over the hostage situation.

735
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,618
That was different.

736
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:28,395
We've had a woman raped, and
we can't contact Dr. Williams.

737
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,526
Gary, do me a favor.

738
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,662
Phone HQ.
Put some pressure on them.

739
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,468
Tell them you need me.
Okay?

740
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,008
Mr. Marshall!

741
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,067
Gary, can you come over
to the lounge with me?

742
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,704
- Not right now.
- I'm afraid it's Mr. Morgan.

743
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,750
Yeah. He said he came back
for a clean shirt.

744
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,116
He said he had some appointment.

745
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,087
Where is he?

746
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,859
- Anyone in here with him?
- No, not yet.

747
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,830
Look, he's very angry.
He keeps punching the locker.

748
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,390
Can't get through to him.

749
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,960
You can't be rational with him.

750
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,336
It's really upset me I'm sorry.

751
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,257
What are you playing at,
you silly bastard?

752
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,884
You'll get them all worried sick
out there.

753
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,899
I needed a clean shirt.

754
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,400
Easy.

755
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,296
I have to have a clean shirt.

756
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,102
I went home.
I couldn't find one.

757
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,641
I had to get a clean shirt.

758
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,267
I've got the see
the area manager.

759
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,005
I've got to go over
the hostage situation.

760
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,276
I have got to pick myself up
and get on with it.

761
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,284
I needed a clean shirt.

762
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,287
Well, have you got one?

763
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,051
Yeah, I've got
a clean shirt now, Gary.

764
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,650
I always have one in my locker.

765
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,957
Good.

766
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,430
What is the matter with me?

767
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,662
I don't know what I'm doing.

768
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,363
I'd better go home now.

769
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,233
You going off duty soon?

770
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,452
Couldn't give me a lift,
could you?

771
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,654
I didn't come on the bike today.

772
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,306
Not on the bike.

773
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,241
- Hey, Gary?
- Yeah?

774
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,482
It's not like
falling off a bike.

775
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,491
I can't get back up.
Can't make it.

776
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,049
Sorry.

777
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,492
I am sorry.

778
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,120
It's okay, mate.

779
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,998
- Andrews.
- Mr. Andrews?

780
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,907
HOC Marshall at Barfield.

781
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,069
Have you heard yet
what went down today?

782
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,271
No, I haven't.

783
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,075
A member of the staff was raped.

784
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,345
- What?
- Yes, raped.

785
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,818
Give me the details.
Who was involved?

786
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,252
It was a Miss Bullock.

787
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,789
She's locked herself
in her office.

788
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,087
And she refused to give
a statement to the police.

789
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,627
So I suggest
you contact Miss Hewitt

790
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,754
and get her here
as a matter of priority.

791
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,303
All right, stand up.
The doctor wants to examine you.

792
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,643
- Has he been body searched?
- Of course he has.

793
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,289
All right, breathe in.

794
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,120
And out.

795
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,685
In.

796
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,991
Out.

797
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,496
Good.

798
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,528
Arms up, please.

799
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,130
Up.

800
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,208
All right.

801
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,973
Give him a hot milky drink,
lots of sugar.

802
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,604
What did I do?

803
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,850
Lock him up.

804
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,288
âª Oblivion âª

805
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,849
âª Oblivion âª

806
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:20,832
âª It's my oblivion âª

807
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,498
I know she's been having
a terrible time with him.

808
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,095
I feel sorry for her.

809
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,800
He leaves all the doors open.

810
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,811
Goes into a rage
if she shuts the front door.

811
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,245
She said he's taken knives,
God knows what, to bed with him.

812
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,873
Leaves them under the pillow.

813
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,508
He's like a stranger.

814
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,815
Well, you know how cheerful
he always was.

815
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,014
I mean, nothing affected him,
did it?

816
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:48,287
She said he's been diagnosed
as clinically depressed.

817
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,385
Anyway, I'd better
get back to work.

818
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,396
Obviously not a good time
to bother you.

819
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,522
That's all right.

820
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,191
Are you still liking it?

821
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,360
Is it the library, innit?
You still working there?

822
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,927
I just can't settle.

823
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,441
I was wondering with him,
Keller, going...

824
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,340
He is, isn't he, going,
Mr. Keller?

825
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,935
Yes, but keep it quiet.

826
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,011
Excuse me.

827
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,947
Mrs. Gill,
this is Mavis O'Connell.

828
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,245
- I used to work here.
- Really?

829
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,048
There's a list of the members
of the amateur dramatic society

830
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,212
that will need clearance.

831
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,052
Yeah, well, cancel them.
There's no bloody musical.

832
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,853
I'll show you out, Mavis.

833
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,019
Nice to meet you.

834
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,816
Doc Harris
has been trying to coax her out.

835
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,436
Seems like ages.
Don't know what else to do.

836
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,138
Annette...

837
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:47,008
Nobody's forcing you
to do anything.

838
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,317
We just want to do
what's best for you.

839
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,687
Leave me alone, please.

840
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,792
- What did she say then?
- She wants to be left alone.

841
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,076
She's refused to go to the local
hospital for an examination.

842
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,092
I mean, what else
am I supposed to do?

843
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,262
Ah, this is bloody ridiculous,
this is.

844
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,515
She's the one supposed to be
handling this kind of situation.

845
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,871
That's right.

846
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,467
Did he actually do it?

847
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,738
I don't know, do I?

848
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,679
Ruddy area manager's
about as helpful as a whippet.

849
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,182
So, what do we do now?

850
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,215
An omen,
or just wishful thinking?

851
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,526
Mr. Andrews said it was urgent.

852
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,929
He's worried about this rape
getting into the press.

853
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,057
So would I be.

854
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,125
Coming on the heels
of the hostage situation.

855
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,370
Not looking good for Barfield
or you, is it, Mr. Bunny?

856
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,674
Mrs. Gill, Miss Hewitt is here
to see Miss Bullock.

857
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,713
You can use
Governor Keller's office.

858
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,080
I've had no instructions
from Governor Keller,

859
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,585
so I thought,
for security purposes,

860
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,554
I should keep the office locked.

861
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,603
The report.

862
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,640
Mr. Andrews called you in, then,
did he?

863
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,403
- Yeah.
- She's still in her office.

864
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,137
Okay, just let me
look over the report,

865
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,611
and then ask Miss Bullock
if she'll see me.

866
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,171
- Just give me a minute.
- Yeah.

867
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,686
Just wishful thinking.

868
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,925
You obviously haven't spoken
to Mr. Andrews.

869
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,292
Well, I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

870
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,887
but as from 9:00 tomorrow,

871
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,523
I am the official governor
of Barfield Prison.

872
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,730
Now, it's up to you whether
you accept that posting or not.

873
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,135
Everyone's replaceable,

874
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,538
be they area manager
or governor, correct?

875
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:54,773
Well, I think there may have
been some misunderstanding.

876
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,044
I don't think so.

877
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,642
Still, whatever our
personal differences,

878
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,710
now is not the time
to discuss them.

879
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,058
Congratulations.

880
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,856
Is it a transitory posting?

881
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,486
No.

882
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:15,795
I'll have a three-year
guarantee, actually.

883
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:31,045
Uh, please, could you clear
everyone from the corridor?

884
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,048
This way.

885
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,585
Go on, there's tea and coffee
in the governor's office.

886
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,352
Come on, everyone,
this isn't a show.

887
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:46,521
Miss Bullock,
I'm unlocking your door.

888
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,938
Annette.

889
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,042
It's Helen Hewitt.

890
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,375
Hope you don't mind.

891
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,848
We've met.

892
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,812
Is the detective still waiting?

893
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,583
Yep.

894
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,124
Corridor was
a bit like Piccadilly.

895
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,058
Pitiful, really.

896
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,659
Still, you can also take it

897
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,198
that everyone is very concerned
about you.

898
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,362
Can I call you Annette?

899
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,630
Please don't talk down to me.
I do know the routine.

900
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,007
All I wanted
was to be left alone.

901
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,844
I'm sure you do know the
routine, but not as a victim.

902
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,975
You might not be able
to make the right decision.

903
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,616
Because I'm in shock?

904
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,624
Yes.
Of course you are.

905
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:03,769
This was my fault.

906
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,538
I should have been
more wary, watchful, whatever.

907
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:11,510
I allowed myself to be lulled
into a false sense of security.

908
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,448
He was drugged out.

909
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,257
His eyes, his speech.

910
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,695
His aggression,
his physical violence.

911
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,789
He didn't know
what he was doing.

912
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,564
Was he able to penetrate you?

913
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,266
Yes, briefly.

914
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,333
I'll have
all the necessary tests.

915
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,342
Obviously I want him punished,

916
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,111
but I don't want to
bring criminal charges

917
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,346
outside the prison itself.

918
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:55,883
I'd like this to be kept
as private as is possible.

919
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,293
It's finished, over, done with.

920
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,696
I just want to
get back to my work.

921
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,462
Which is what I've been doing.

922
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,432
Uh, it may not be possible
to keep it quiet.

923
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,241
You see,
there were no eyewitnesses.

924
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,911
And since you do not wish
to press charges,

925
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,888
Mr. Snooper therefore
cannot be charged with assault.

926
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:29,522
But you have admitted
that it took place.

927
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,586
Of course.
It did.

928
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,893
So, what could happen

929
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:37,697
is that Mr. Snooper
will get 28 days

930
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:42,035
for committing an illegal act
within the prison.

931
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,802
The illegal act
is having intercourse

932
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,898
with a member of staff.

933
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,706
You could also be fired,
Miss Bullock,

934
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,777
for the same offense.

935
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,009
Oh, for God's sake,
you can't be serious.

936
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,143
I'm afraid I am.

937
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,347
It means you are up against it
to press charges, Annette.

938
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,459
Is this what you've come in here
to tell me?

939
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,224
That I might be fired

940
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,096
for having intercourse
with a prisoner that raped me?

941
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,495
Hopefully we may be able to
charge Mr. Snooper

942
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:14,630
with dealing drugs.

943
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,833
I just don't want you
to make any decision

944
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,035
without giving it
due consideration.

945
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,846
I am not going to press charges.

946
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:35,823
I have no intention

947
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,691
of being forced into court
to give evidence.

948
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:44,564
Or of being coerced into giving
a statement to the police.

949
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,628
I was mistaken.

950
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:49,674
Nothing happened.

951
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,240
So you see, Miss Hewitt,
I've made my decision.

952
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,547
I am not hysterical
or, as you inferred,

953
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:04,020
suffering from shock.

954
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,420
Do you mind if I go home?

955
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,589
And if Miss Purvis
is still here.

956
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,660
Sorry?

957
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,889
Pianist.

958
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:23,966
"His vomit spluttered
on the thick, hairy rug."

959
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,304
Bloody hell.

960
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,409
"Sever... "Is that "severed"?

961
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,676
"Severed from its body,

962
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,617
the black, silky head
of the great hor..."

963
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,483
Bloody hell,
it's his horse, man.

964
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,250
He cut off
the head of his horse!

965
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,257
Oh, shut it, Bri.

966
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,294
Everybody knows he found
a horse's head in his bed.

967
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,522
Didn't you see the film?

968
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,757
Yeah, it was on telly,
but I missed it.

969
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,265
Reading is fantastic, isn't it?

970
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,430
Opened up a whole world for me.

971
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,770
I'll be able to write to you,
Eugene.

972
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:58,639
Be writing to Snoopy as well.

973
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:03,377
You won't be going out
for frigging curry.

974
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,813
Tell you,
he'll get about six years

975
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,162
for what he did to Miss Bullock.

976
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,451
Why did he do it, eh?

977
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,454
Why did he do it?

978
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:12,962
I mean, I won't be here
for the show,

979
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,501
but they'll cancel it now,
won't they?

980
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,255
Bastard.

981
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,887
Tell you, he'd better not
come back on this wing.

982
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,454
If he does, I'll kill him.

983
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,898
Oh, shut it, you tit head.

984
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:30,069
âª Titwillow, titwillow âª

985
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:34,237
Can I ask you something, Gary?
And I want a straight answer.

986
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,007
Mm-hmm.

987
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,242
It was you who started the vote
of no confidence

988
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,715
against Keller, right?

989
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,719
Yeah.

990
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,846
Why didn't you
put yourself forward?

991
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,481
Not the right rank.

992
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,822
Could have stood in.

993
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:51,419
Even just temporarily.

994
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,690
No.

995
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,597
You see, I can't distance meself
like you can.

996
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,033
I don't have
the education you have.

997
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,968
And I'm not a number one.

998
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,303
I know that now,
but I didn't before.

999
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,041
Did they move the kennels?

1000
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,607
Nope.
That's, uh, Tarzan.

1001
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,381
- Sorry?
- Victor Braithwaite, as was.

1002
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,683
Good night.

1003
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,584
I tipped the boys off
at the gate.

1004
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,594
Well, I'm touched.

1005
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,463
Uh, there is
just one thing, though.

1006
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,229
This isn't my Range Rover,

1007
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,999
so I hope that foam comes off
in a car wash.

1008
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,869
- Good night.
- Good night.

1009
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,046
Good night, Governor.
Welcome back.

1009
00:49:49,305 --> 00:50:49,320
