FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,684
It's your day off,
so take care of your own meals.

4
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,683
I'm coming home after eating dinner.

5
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,814
From Mom.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,640
I know we've been busy making a living,

7
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,821
but we should've said
these things in our lives.

8
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,740
I love you,

9
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,823
my son.

10
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,728
{\an8}I drank too much wine that day.

11
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,531
{\an8}You know that's not an excuse.

12
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,739
{\an8}I won't make excuses.

13
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,032
{\an8}Threatening those around you

14
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,446
{\an8}and giving them a hard time
just because you're hurt

15
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,905
{\an8}is a terrible thing to do.

16
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,919
{\an8}Do you know what I tried

17
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,168
{\an8}the hardest
after you came out of the closet?

18
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,470
I studied you.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,720
You don't have to try that hard.

20
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,758
Just forget me completely and start over.

21
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,978
I can start over
only when the end is good.

22
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,647
Even though I only studied a bit,

23
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,609
I could tell what kind of world

24
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,861
you were living in.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,113
But it's still wrong.

26
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,113
Since that day,

27
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,447
I never opened the door to that room.

28
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,825
You have to see it.

29
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,502
Look for yourself how unproductive
and violent that moment was.

30
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,174
And clean it up.

31
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,249
Don't even leave a shard of glass.

32
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,628
The green light is on.

33
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,248
You may cross the street.

34
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,959
Ms. Jin-sook.

35
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,511
It's not too late, is it?

36
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,762
You're smiling.

37
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,037
Can Iâ¦

38
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,172
love you again?

39
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,222
Mr. Sang-sik!

40
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,220
Somebody help!

41
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,268
Somebody help, please!

42
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,561
Please help!

43
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,225
Somebody help!

44
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,315
Do you need help?

45
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,072
Are you okay?

46
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,776
I felt a bit dizzy.

47
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,161
I'm okay.

48
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,387
Dad has a bad liver.

49
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,180
He shouldn't drink.

50
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,393
He's been to the ER
too many times this year.

51
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,774
Liquor bottles were everywhere
in his house.

52
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,021
The ER is a money-eating monster.

53
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,733
I told Mom to watch Dad.

54
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,864
Is she still going to dance classes?

55
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,198
Money doesn't grow on trees.

56
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,738
Whether it's health or money,

57
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,531
when you have troublemaker parents,

58
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,615
that means you are middle-aged.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,120
Both you and I are growing old
because of Mom and Dad.

60
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm going to part ways with your father.

61
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,603
He didn't take it.

62
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,272
Regardless, he did
carry the medicine with him.

63
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,693
Are you

64
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,611
saying it's my fault?

65
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,479
Dad.

66
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,686
-Dad.
-Dad.

67
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,186
Tell her I'm going to work!

68
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,027
You'd all feel comfortable without me.

69
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,203
You're Mom is anxious

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,870
because I may say something dumb!

71
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,909
Dad, don't do that on this joyful day--

72
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,122
Get out!

73
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,582
All of you, don't stop him!

74
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,622
Let him go!

75
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,584
Mom.

76
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,464
-Dad, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

77
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,593
We're all family.

78
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,723
I thought we should
at least know each other's faces.

79
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,181
Troublemaking parents?

80
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,731
Good grief.

81
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,373
Is your dizziness better?

82
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,622
Yes.

83
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,333
Ringing in the ear and feeling dizzy

84
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,964
are the symptoms of BPPV.

85
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,540
Recentlyâ¦

86
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,245
he lost his memories.

87
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,336
Shouldn't he have a thorough scan?

88
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,052
Yes, if you want a thorough scan,

89
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,472
please make an appointment
online or over the phone.

90
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,505
Okay.

91
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,362
Hello?

92
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,333
Hi.

93
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,123
Yes, I'm at my office now.

94
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,210
-Hi.
-Hi.

95
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,764
Thank you for doing this
when I asked so suddenly.

96
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,838
It's okay.

97
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,133
It's a new type of favor,
so I'm excited too.

98
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,718
-Please get in.
-Okay.

99
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,681
Lie down and rest.

100
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,731
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,903
You missed the show because of me.

102
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,572
You should've said
you wanted to rest if you were sick.

103
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,702
Missing a show won't kill us.
They do it all the time.

104
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,275
I never won against you in an argument.

105
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,953
How can I ever win against you
in an argument?

106
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,288
Right?

107
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,502
What's the point of winning
and losing about this?

108
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,553
No one's giving you prize money
for winning.

109
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,261
See? I lost again.

110
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,222
I threw the lunch box
because I couldn't win an argument.

111
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,152
Iâ¦

112
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,437
I only threw the lunch box, right?

113
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,315
I didn't smash a window
or anything, right?

114
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,367
The doctor said at the time

115
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,700
that the imagination and memories
would be mixed up.

116
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,213
It looks like you smashed
tons of them in your head.

117
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,671
If you ever did that in front of the kids,

118
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,841
I would've kicked you out
of the house already.

119
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,087
I may be narrow-minded and ignorant,
but I'm not that terrible.

120
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,312
I hope I'm not badly ill.

121
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,497
Youâ¦

122
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,503
So you do know how to come here.

123
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,337
I'm sorry about that day.
I will never do that again.

124
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,129
Okay.

125
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,296
Thank you.

126
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,144
I'm going to meet the attorney.

127
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,005
We'll settle things the way Eun-joo wants.

128
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,347
What's the point of seeing
the attorney then?

129
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,682
I don't want to calculate.

130
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,774
Eun-joo would've earned that much
if she kept working.

131
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,147
Andâ¦

132
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,356
I'm going to close my clinic,
but keep on working as a doctor.

133
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,279
Because I seem so pathetic,

134
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,031
I won't give up on everything.

135
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,868
Did you find a place to go?

136
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,245
I'm looking for it.

137
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,749
So don't make things worse.

138
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,546
I'll talk to Dad next time.

139
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,338
You hate that, right?

140
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,553
I'm leaving.

141
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,019
Eun-hee.

142
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,597
What?

143
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:15,282
Have you ever wondered why
Chan-hyuk doesn't have a driver's license?

144
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,030
He said he was going to get it.
He's getting a permit soon.

145
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,945
That's what I mean. He's been carrying
all that heavy camera equipment,

146
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,285
and he's getting a driver's license now?

147
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,924
Why are you suddenly curious?

148
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,627
Well, I didn't think much about it,

149
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,838
but Seo-young looked at him as a loser,
like she knows something.

150
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,801
Chan-hyuk knows everything
about our family story,

151
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,806
Don't you think you're too indifferent
to your friend's family story?

152
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,900
Sharing a family story
isn't a condition to be friends.

153
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,398
I'm the type to say everything,
and he's the type not to say anything.

154
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,074
Have you ever asked him?

155
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,196
Wow.

156
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,945
-It's great.
-Yes.

157
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,288
This is something I wanted
to experience in Korea.

158
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,537
I have no friends here, so I called you.

159
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,958
It's my first time here too.

160
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,756
I guess it is a new type of favor.

161
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,717
If it's your first time,
then I'm less burdened.

162
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,438
"My hometown birds

163
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,189
cry out 'peace.'"

164
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,610
This quote is by a cellist

165
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,018
who escaped the dictator.
He missed his hometown.

166
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,067
After I read that, I thoughtâ¦

167
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,241
I had to hear the birds singing in Korea.

168
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,782
I guess he missed peace so much,

169
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,985
so the birds' songs sounded like "peace."

170
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,036
We have scops owls.

171
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,790
"Scoop it."

172
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,121
That's their singing sound.

173
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,923
The birds sound so different
depending on where you liveâ¦

174
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,458
I guess I didn't know.

175
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,432
After I came here,
everything is difficult,

176
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,260
my comprehension dropped,
and I'm making lots of mistakes.

177
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,217
That's how it is.

178
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,311
When did you leave Korea?

179
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,904
When I was ten,
my parents decided on their own

180
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,151
to send me to the US alone,
where my aunt is.

181
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,073
If you were ten, it must've been hard.

182
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,952
I knew you would understand.

183
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,580
At school, English gave me a hard time,
and at homeâ¦

184
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,997
I walked on eggshells with my aunt.

185
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,539
Couldn't they have told me

186
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,462
about what would happen

187
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,041
if I study abroad?

188
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,424
I blamed my parents a bit.

189
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,549
I'm sure your parents didn't know, either.

190
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,390
We're grown-ups too, so I'm saying this.

191
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,470
Grown-ups are a bitâ¦

192
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,524
stupidâ¦

193
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,928
and immature.

194
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,581
Have you ever wondered why
Chan-hyuk doesn't have a driver's license?

195
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,640
EUN-HEE

196
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,220
Hey.

197
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,267
Where are you, Chan-pal?

198
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,814
I'm out to eat.

199
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,267
A blind date?

200
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,401
Sorry. I'll hang up.

201
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,753
Figuring out the situation
just by the tone of your voice

202
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,170
without explaining that
you're meeting someone

203
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,209
and hanging up so she won't bother you.

204
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,423
I guess only old friends can do it, right?

205
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,048
She always pretends to be sharp-witted.

206
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,057
CEO Park.

207
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,227
What does Eun-hee hate the most?

208
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,782
How would I know?

209
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,786
I'm not even sure about what I hate.

210
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,581
Hating someone.

211
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,877
She hates that the most
and feels pain from it.

212
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,429
It looks likeâ¦

213
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,808
I've been giving pain to Eun-hee.

214
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,760
Eat it.

215
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,332
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

216
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,752
You really didn't listen to me
your whole life.

217
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,086
You know that, right?

218
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,055
Start listening to me from now on.

219
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,523
Don't just worry about your illness,

220
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,944
just go to a big hospital
for a checkup and be relieved.

221
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,565
When you're old, you have to learn
to think of hospitals as your friend.

222
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,790
Don't tell the kids.

223
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,079
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

224
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,333
Would that be okay?

225
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,331
Don't you feel sad?

226
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,089
You heard it too.

227
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,630
When parents cause trouble,
the kids get old.

228
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,139
We didn't cause that much trouble.

229
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,389
I caused trouble.

230
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,931
Graduation from marriage,

231
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,434
failing to keep the secret,

232
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,847
becoming 22 years old again,
they're my fault.

233
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,112
You must think it's unfair.

234
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,704
A smart person like you becoming
a troublemaker because of me.

235
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,278
Our kids don't think
of me as a troublemaker.

236
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,537
I doubt that.

237
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,081
Have you ever read their minds?

238
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,922
Even if you graduate from marriage
and break up with me,

239
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,173
to our kids, we're always a pair.

240
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,722
You chose to be with a troublemaker,
which means you're also a troublemaker.

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,470
Here.

242
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,596
Troublemaker.

243
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,231
Have some.

244
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,811
Here.

245
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,163
It's about time for her to come.

246
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,311
Why am I hiding?

247
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,319
Go inside.

248
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,783
Don't think too much and go to bed.

249
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,742
Go on.

250
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,487
And drive safely.

251
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,452
Go on first.

252
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,998
Be careful.

253
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,536
Mom is having a fling with Dad,
who was 22 until recently.

254
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,758
EUN-HEE'S

255
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,400
I felt a bit dizzy.

256
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,323
I'm okay.

257
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,787
When did

258
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,553
time pass so quickly?

259
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,354
Just when?

260
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,901
Eun-joo, you were right.

261
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,609
I had no wits, and I was dumb.

262
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,334
They were like,
"Ms.Sook, you go in first."

263
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,792
"No, you go first, Mr. Sang-sik."

264
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,213
They just filmed a romance movie.

265
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,166
AND AFTER THAT

266
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,500
THE LIES OF MEMORIES

267
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,884
The new semester started
even before graduation.

268
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,804
My sisters.

269
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,760
say something, please.

270
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,209
I worked so hard this time.
I even put my soul into it.

271
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,304
Wait, I left my documents there.

272
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,593
I'm sorry.

273
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,756
Patent Attorney Kim.

274
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,348
Hi.

275
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,856
It's been so long.

276
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,438
How are you?

277
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,154
Can you wait for a momentâ¦

278
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,404
I don't think you will.

279
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,664
How about some coffee
from a vending machine?

280
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,368
I have an appointment after.

281
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,370
Okay. See you again.

282
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,582
How's your sister doing?

283
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,253
Your sister

284
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,461
has settled in my heart as my avatar.

285
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,132
Though I don't know her name or looks.

286
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,143
When we were trainees, you told me that

287
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,810
if your sister was born a man,
she would be just like me.

288
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,140
I thought you were thinking
of me as a family-like colleague,

289
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,266
but there was a twist.

290
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,362
Your sister is immature, nosy,

291
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,069
makes things messy,
can't be straightforward, andâ¦

292
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,565
her drinking habits are similar to mine.

293
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,323
I think I was scolded
for like five minutes.

294
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,995
That was when you were a trainee.

295
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,868
You're a CEO now.

296
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,165
I'm not a CEO. I'm a chief.

297
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,921
I don't remember dragging
my sister into it,

298
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,836
but I remember you didn't work hard,
saying trainees don't drop out,

299
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,387
so I worked hard on my own.

300
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,678
Oh.

301
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,217
I didn't remember that.

302
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:22,767
But I think I was lucky to have you
as my training partner.

303
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,322
Yes, I think this would be
a good way to finish it.

304
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,493
Okay.

305
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,348
Yes, you smelled a get-together, huh?

306
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,058
I'm having a martini
with the vice CEO tonight.

307
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,430
You should join us.

308
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,351
Just the two of you?

309
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,519
I, the incompetent one, have to work late.

310
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,238
There's always a spot for you.

311
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,294
Goodness.

312
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,171
-I approve of it.
-Want me to get you a taxi?

313
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,713
-Okay, see you tomorrow, bye.
-Have a safe trip home.

314
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,241
Kyung-okâ¦

315
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,605
knows about us.

316
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:56,986
Soâ¦

317
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,367
you shouldn't try too hard

318
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,786
to find out if she knows

319
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,501
or if she

320
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,751
spread rumors or not.

321
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,009
Rumors about me are fine.

322
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,473
But I don't want you to be in it.

323
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,175
I think I'd be too sorryâ¦

324
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,885
to you, Eun-hee.

325
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,322
You were so confident
about knowing people's personalities,

326
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,438
but you know nothing.

327
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,777
Kyung-ok wonât tell anyone.

328
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,161
The rumors about you were
spread before it, so it canât be helped,

329
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,369
but she will never mention me.

330
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,999
Kyung-ok is moderately timid and nice.

331
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,871
If she wants to spread rumors,

332
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,337
I'm sure she'll spread it
only when one of us

333
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,129
quits working.

334
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,301
And Iâ¦

335
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,223
don't care about the rumors.

336
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,892
It's not a made-up story.

337
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,140
I need to bear
that much of a rumor at least.

338
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,771
There were actually rumors about us
because I'm with her all the time.

339
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,651
I didn't meet her just to protect you.

340
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,409
Ms. Seo has lots of her own worries too.

341
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,736
I was wrong about people.

342
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,700
I need to start studying people
from the beginning.

343
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,666
Eun-hee.

344
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,799
Why aren't you asking me about
what Ha-ra told you last time?

345
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,684
You didn't think of asking,
since we're done?

346
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,429
Iâ¦

347
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,521
didn't believe what she said.

348
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,694
With a breakup coming up,
can you show your worst,

349
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,614
hurt each other
with words you shouldn't say,

350
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,244
get harmed and scarred,

351
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,363
and thenâ¦

352
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,291
suddenly become intimate and make love?

353
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,826
Can't you say it's because you trusted me?

354
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,714
I did trust you a bit too.

355
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,091
For a heartwarming ending.

356
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,715
On my day off, I met Chan-hyuk.

357
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,603
We sank our feet into the valley
and ate boiled chicken.

358
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,612
I'm trying to wrap it up
as a heartwarming ending in my way.

359
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,655
Goodbye. Drive safely.

360
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,789
Okay. Bye.

361
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,539
Over here.

362
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,212
-Hi.
-Yes, hi.

363
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,830
-I'll leave it to you.
-Okay.

364
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,724
When you come out of the closet,

365
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,683
the people around you react in two ways.

366
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,353
They drift apart feeling disgusted,

367
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,442
or they try to be nicer all of a sudden.

368
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,689
Why are you saying that
when we came all the way here?

369
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,197
That's how you behaved.

370
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,242
You acted like my friend, my sister,

371
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,036
and even like my mom at times.

372
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,293
It must've been tiring.

373
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,840
I just felt even more sorry.

374
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,388
If Mom didn't come home on that day,

375
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,928
I would've apologized

376
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,984
with courage while I was drunk.

377
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,265
And then I would've packed
and left quietly.

378
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,981
But when I saw Momâ¦

379
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,860
I didn't feel anything but anger.

380
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,669
I'm sorry.

381
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,628
I'm so sorry

382
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,142
that it's difficult to say sorry.

383
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,358
If you two are here together
what am I supposed to do?

384
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,433
Now. Stay alert.

385
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,312
Step on the brake when you begin,

386
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,310
start the car, turn on
the turn signal, and go straight!

387
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,563
You're distracting.

388
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,484
It's a hill.

389
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,524
Brake.

390
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,688
Stop.

391
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,695
Good. Turn your wheel more to the left.

392
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,832
No, to the left.

393
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,739
Slow down.

394
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,117
Hey, go straight.

395
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,254
-Go straight.
-Be quiet.

396
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,080
-Hey, like this.
-Okay, got it.

397
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,075
Now, here's the T-shaped road.

398
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,377
Go slightly slanted.

399
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,588
Turn the wheel to the left.

400
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,132
To the left.

401
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,295
Turn more.

402
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,594
Go in.

403
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,758
Slowly.

404
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,135
You failed.

405
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,847
Gosh.

406
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,399
Try it one more time.

407
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,404
Go away. You're making it worse.
Aren't you busy?

408
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,624
My friend is getting ready
for a very important license.

409
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,490
So I made time to come.

410
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,615
Ji-woo is so obvious.
He can't keep any secrets.

411
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,996
He even told you about this place?

412
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,344
To ask me why I didn't
get my driver's license until now?

413
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,302
I'm here to ask something else.

414
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,759
So many incidents were happening
at the same time that day.

415
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,386
So I suddenly recalled something I forgot.

416
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,393
During the period of coincidence,

417
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,808
when I met Jong-pal.

418
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,899
Right.

419
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,360
The wedding anniversary.

420
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,901
He asked me for your phone number.

421
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,776
Even when we cut ties,
I got your new phone number

422
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,736
via group message.

423
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,081
There's no need to be curious about that.

424
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,003
We blocked each other,
so he didnât get the group message either.

425
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,247
Exactly.

426
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,759
I'm curiousâ¦

427
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,051
about how things ended with you guys.

428
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
She came to my house and caused a ruckus.

429
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,016
How can I go to you in the middle of that?

430
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,771
Come on, Soo. I'm done with her.

431
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,110
Please believe me.

432
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,228
I can't go. I drank.

433
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,107
You're coming?

434
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,605
Yes, come and see.

435
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,156
We finished talking. We're done.

436
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,490
All right, see you in a bit.

437
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,950
Did you eat? Do you want a drink?

438
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,077
Hey.

439
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,833
I didn't eat, drink, or hang out with her.

440
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,246
I kept quiet
because I couldn't kick her out.

441
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,245
-That's the same thing.
-Call her, you jerk.

442
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,668
Meet her outside.

443
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,506
I don't ever want to see her again.

444
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,341
Are you loyal to Eun-hee now?

445
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,547
She wouldn't even know.

446
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,177
Don't ever think of seeing Eun-hee.

447
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,523
You damn punk.

448
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,685
Why are you being so grouchy?

449
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,068
You know it gets weird
if you two meet without me, right?

450
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,503
I heard you punched him.

451
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,116
Rumor spreads.

452
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,706
You thought I wouldn't know?

453
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,251
I also know that there was
a rumor about us because of that.

454
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,302
Why ask if you know everything?

455
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,301
To see how you'd answer me.

456
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,968
But again you won't be straight with me.

457
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,057
Do I not mean much to you?

458
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,494
I'd feel really bad then.

459
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,201
Give me a chance

460
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,737
to be your personal safe

461
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,541
for once.

462
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,349
Eun-joo.

463
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,564
What's the emergency?

464
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,404
I'm going to tell Mom
about my divorce today.

465
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,819
Okay.

466
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,279
Tell her.

467
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,321
Tell her about it.

468
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,485
You got this.

469
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,623
I cheered for you, so goodbye.

470
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,697
Stay next to me when I tell her.

471
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,042
You told me not to waste my energy
on mediating conflicts.

472
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,843
Do it. You're the best at doing it.

473
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,049
Okay.

474
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,697
Hi.

475
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,207
I was craving your food, Mom.

476
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,457
You should've told me beforehand.

477
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,384
I was too frazzled these days
to go get groceries.

478
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,174
I just need kimchi.'

479
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,342
Okay.

480
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,149
Did you tell her?

481
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,821
Mom, I'm here.

482
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,241
You're here too? What's going on?

483
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,780
-Are you cooking? Can I help?
-Sure.

484
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,576
First, put beer in the fridge.

485
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,879
Mom, you have some too.

486
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,924
No, thanks.

487
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,889
Mom.

488
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,180
Let's eat first.

489
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,892
Momâ¦

490
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,437
what were you planning to do
after graduating from marriage?

491
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,316
Me?

492
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,077
DIFFERENT LIVES MEETING ON THE ROAD

493
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,764
Olle Trail and Dulle Trail.

494
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,511
I wanted to walk
the beautiful trails all over Korea.

495
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,306
I liked

496
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,266
Simon and Garfunkle.

497
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,189
You did?

498
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,438
There was this movie
with the song "El Condor Pasa" in it.

499
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,276
It's about a woman
who went through a hard time.

500
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,163
And she walks an extremely rough trail.

501
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,655
I was watching that movie,

502
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,374
and I wanted to try

503
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,918
walking the trail

504
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,165
with a backpack.

505
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,456
It became my dream.

506
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,676
This is the line from the movie.

507
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,678
"How wild it was,

508
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,016
to just let time pass."

509
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,732
Something like that.

510
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,074
I just

511
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,151
love that line so much.

512
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,532
I've been struggling all my life,

513
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,448
and I don't think I had

514
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,622
the chance to slack off
as much as I wanted to.

515
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,922
Your father lived like that too.

516
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,554
Then he got old all of a sudden.

517
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,385
What's wrong with you?

518
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,515
Let's go, Mom. We can go
to the Olle Trail in Jeju,

519
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,812
the Dulre Trail in Jirisan,
and just walk across the entire country.

520
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,727
Youâ¦

521
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,573
Donât make any promises
you can't even keep.

522
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,690
Three women on a trip?
It can be dangerous.

523
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,737
Why can't I keep it?
What's dangerous about it?

524
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,662
You should stop party-pooping
about everything.

525
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,242
Let's go. Say you will go.

526
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,498
Yes.

527
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,619
Let's go, the three of us.

528
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,826
And we'll walk slowly
only on the safe trails.

529
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,923
Give me some of that too.

530
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,835
Okay.

531
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,473
Let me try drinking too.

532
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,300
Yes, you should drink some too.

533
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,694
Ms. Jin-sook, itâs been a while
since you drank.

534
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,356
Cheers!

535
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,269
A toast!

536
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,607
Hurry!

537
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,070
Cheers!

538
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,445
Let's go!

539
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,430
Hey, get in!

540
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,856
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

541
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,119
It's so fast!

542
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,499
Go, Dad!

543
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,619
Go!

544
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,434
What brings you here?

545
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,597
Did your mother send you?

546
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,729
I came because I wanted to see you.

547
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,321
That's not how you hold the guitar.

548
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,339
I taught myself.

549
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,845
Dad.

550
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,152
I behaved like a kid that day.

551
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,743
You're the youngest.
Of course, you have to behave like one.

552
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,740
And you're all grown up.

553
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,622
You save all the money,

554
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,869
don't waste it, and you know
how to take care of yourself.

555
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,630
Dad.

556
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,958
You need to work less and drive safely.

557
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:36,971
Andâ¦

558
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,550
Yes, the point.

559
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,805
You should come back home now.

560
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,520
That's just your wish.

561
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,152
No.

562
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,395
I leave the house often too.

563
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,072
I'm worried about Mom being alone
at home all the time,

564
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,611
and you're not well, soâ¦

565
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,115
That'sâ¦

566
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,330
for us to decide.

567
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,245
Okay.

568
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,464
You little brat.

569
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,131
Mom.

570
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,796
You need to be firm
if you made up your mind.

571
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,594
Don't worry too much about Dad.

572
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,850
If you keep on looking after him,
pampering him, and seeing him,

573
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,482
it'll be harder for him to move out.

574
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,363
You can look after him a bit.
He's still a beginner.

575
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,152
But if you go see him, you'll get weak,

576
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,695
so send Ji-woo or Eun-hee instead.

577
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,779
I disagree. He has to learn
how to do chores, so don't look after him.

578
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,117
Don't be his mom.

579
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,042
But you should meet him.

580
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,705
Ms. Sook. Mr. Sang-sik.

581
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,460
Call each other like that
and go on a date.

582
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,462
Be quiet.

583
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,005
Why do you care?

584
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,512
That's for us to decide.

585
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,970
"Us?"

586
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,850
-I'm going to go make money.
-Okay, cheer up!

587
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,100
Yes, have a safe trip home.

588
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,390
-Bye.
-Drive safely.

589
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,648
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

590
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,451
I likedâ¦

591
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,995
Alain Delon.

592
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,498
-Alain Delon?
-Yes.

593
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,620
Alain Delon?

594
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,706
I don't think I've ever seen an actor
more handsome than he is.

595
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,381
Wow, this is crazy.

596
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,713
You care about looks.

597
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,886
I knew already.

598
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,974
You knew?

599
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,393
So you two shared
your tastes and left me out?

600
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,774
He's so handsome.

601
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:09,204
LOVELY COUPLE

602
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,374
HOLDING HANDS

603
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,050
FAR AWAY THERE IS OUR PARADISE

604
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,719
I feel left out.

605
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,137
How old is that boring song?

606
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,269
Is it from the Joseon Dynasty?

607
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,596
Ji-woo.

608
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,860
-Why?
-My son, come here, okay?

609
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,361
I'm not done with this.

610
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,112
You brat, come here.

611
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,067
Ji-woo, you brat.
Come and sit when Mom calls you.

612
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,866
You're drunk again.

613
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,160
-All right.
-Stop drinking.

614
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,874
You're becoming an alcoholic.

615
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,164
Haveâ¦

616
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,497
Have a drink.

617
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,292
On this joyful day,

618
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,125
we need to have a drink.

619
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,420
Stop drinking.

620
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,217
-Have a drink.
-You drink for a whole week.

621
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,840
Hey, youâ¦

622
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:08,926
Cheers.

623
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,431
Hey, I have to drink alone
if you drink without me.

624
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,564
The problem is
every day is a joyful day for you.

625
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,733
I drink this beer with the money I make.

626
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,475
You call yourself a young brother
and won't even cooperate.

627
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,318
You're a brat at home.

628
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,783
And you always call me all drunk.

629
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,883
Weâ¦

630
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,047
could've lived like this.

631
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,844
Don't be nervous.

632
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,263
I, Kim Sang-sik, am a man

633
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,474
who's never nervous.

634
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,727
Let's make a confession to each other.

635
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,695
Why?

636
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,161
You called me Ms. Sook when you turned 22.

637
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,332
Now that you're memories are back,
you don't have anything to confess?

638
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,790
That's not it.

639
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,165
I'm not good with words.

640
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:13,928
Thenâ¦

641
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,175
you go first.

642
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,186
There were timesâ¦

643
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,107
when I felt that
you were like a big mountain.

644
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,661
Iâ¦

645
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,833
never thought of him who ran away
because he was afraid

646
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,246
to take responsibility for me.

647
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,456
You've been fighting

648
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,213
an illusion all your life.

649
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,310
When we were young,

650
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,984
when you asked nothing,

651
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,898
and said that we can overcome it together,

652
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,911
and announced that you will
be a good father,

653
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,413
you were wonderful.

654
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,961
Thank you for keeping your promise

655
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,210
to be

656
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,955
a good father

657
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,339
until now.

658
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,194
You only kept that promise

659
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,940
and caused all the ruckus, butâ¦

660
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,953
thank you.

661
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:20,048
When did so much time pass?

662
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,231
There isn't anything particular
according to the CT scan from last time.

663
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,025
The CT scan has its limitations.

664
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,406
So you need to get
a more thorough checkup.

665
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,792
I'll muster up the courage

666
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,246
and confess something too.

667
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,380
I don't think I've been
fighting an illusion.

668
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,843
I think I've been fighting
my pathetic self.

669
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:05,891
I felt like a coward who hid the fairy's
robe so she couldn't fly ever again.

670
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,269
I was afraid someone might
criticize me and call me a bastard.

671
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,278
I think I forgotâ¦

672
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,699
about that wonderful young man
of the past before you did.

673
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,599
Now. Stay alert.

674
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,809
Step on the brake when you begin,

675
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,310
start the car, turn on
the turn signal, and go straight!

676
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,232
CHARACTER OVER DRIVING EDUCATION

677
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,897
And stop at the hill.

678
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,937
I passed!

679
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,582
You failed.

680
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,475
Are you hurt?

681
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,397
I'm not.

682
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,192
-You aren't?
-Yes.

683
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,318
Let's check the accident.

684
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,613
An accident at the driving test area.
This rarely happens.

685
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,988
I'm going to take a photo
and make fun of you forever.

686
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,520
You called meâ¦

687
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,440
because you needed a private safe, right?

688
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,815
Want to go to the office?

689
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,700
Fine.

690
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,847
You're the first male human
who came into my house besides my family.

691
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,307
I'll believe you.

692
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,140
Don't believe people easily.

693
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,072
It's quiet.

694
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:50,775
It's quiet, so I was able to stay
hidden for years.

695
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,084
It seemed like
you were looking for a place like this.

696
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,682
I had an older brother.

697
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,518
During the summer break when I was tenâ¦

698
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,600
he passed away.

699
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,401
Donât make that face.
It was a long time ago.

700
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,413
I don't like talking about it
so seriously,

701
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,784
so I didn't say anything.

702
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,788
He was only two years older than me,

703
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,116
but he went on a retreat,

704
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,747
and I went to the driving academy

705
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,837
with my mom and my aunt.

706
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,005
Mom said she'll buy me
the newest game console if she passed,

707
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,182
so I was determined
to never let my brother use it.

708
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,064
My mom passed,

709
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,847
and I felt like I could fly.

710
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,978
But then, my aunt

711
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,775
checked her pager.

712
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,026
Then she looked
at the two of us in silence

713
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,453
and started crying.

714
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,462
My brother

715
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,549
had a car accident
on his way to the retreatâ¦

716
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,681
That situation

717
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,850
made no sense at all.

718
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:54,163
That was the day when my family couldn't
go back to the old days ever again.

719
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,867
My Momâ¦

720
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,004
No, my family

721
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:08,921
was never able to laugh
about small things anymore.

722
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,921
My family doesn't even argue.

723
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,434
Butâ¦

724
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,965
when I went to your house,

725
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,691
saying we have to babysit your brother,

726
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,687
I saw Ji-woo,

727
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,201
and I suddenly recalled

728
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,828
my late brother, so clearly.

729
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,667
I first saw Chan-hyuk when I was 12 too.

730
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,710
He bought me a digital camera
for my 12th birthday.

731
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,585
A digital camera?
The digital camera of the old days?

732
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,513
Yes.

733
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,928
You and Eun-joo bought me

734
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,010
a hamburger meal or toys
because I was young,

735
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,925
but Chan-hyuk gave me a gift
for grown-ups.

736
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,475
We went to take photos
during summer break.

737
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,519
That was when he started
to teach me how to take photos.

738
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,401
That was when I became a grown-up.

739
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,281
He's my true brother,
through middle school, high school,

740
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,279
and my military service.

741
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,325
So that's whyâ¦

742
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,658
you were nice to Ji-woo?

743
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,827
Yes.

744
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,287
When I saw Ji-woo,

745
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,387
I feltâ¦

746
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,510
confusedâ¦

747
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:51,522
A little brother at the same age
when my big brother passed away.

748
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,936
At that time, I finally realized

749
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,317
that my parents have been

750
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,908
enduring all this time.

751
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,500
Ever since then, I felt like
I got a little closer to my parents.

752
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,922
Including my mom,

753
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:20,589
those who know about it think
that I don't learn to drive

754
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,889
because I lost my brother
in a car accident.

755
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,314
Butâ¦

756
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,767
I think

757
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,112
I've been ignoring that place

758
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,653
where my mom collapsed completely,

759
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,111
where our misfortune

760
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,069
had begun.

761
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,406
As I saw Ji-woo growing upâ¦

762
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,332
I thought if my brother was aliveâ¦

763
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,473
he would've done all of these with me.

764
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,460
I'm sorryâ¦

765
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,419
I comforted the ten-year-old you

766
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,342
too late.

767
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,942
Goodbye.

768
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,793
I forgot to say something important.

769
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,548
About what I said earlier.

770
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,466
I promised myself to tell

771
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,046
the story to the person
that would be by my side forever.

772
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,017
But you saidâ¦

773
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,481
you will be with me forever

774
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,807
already.

775
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,980
I'm going to keep
seeing you, contacting you,

776
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,317
and be on good terms with you, my friend.

777
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,739
"My friend."

778
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,164
You forgot "My friend."

779
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,912
Isnât that too cowardly?

780
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,117
What's the point of being
friends forever at our age?

781
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,078
At that timeâ¦

782
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,786
I told you.

783
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,836
Everything about my relationshipâ¦

784
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,420
While you know nothing about mine?

785
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,506
I do.

786
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,431
So,

787
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,724
I don't care about that.

788
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,852
And the you I know
don't care about that, either.

789
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,309
You can be my friend then.

790
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,733
Well, we'll see each other forever anyway,

791
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,231
so I'm sure you'll change
when you get bored.

792
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,357
Drive safely.

793
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,321
Come in.

794
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,641
Sit comfortably.

795
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,727
Mother.

796
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,699
Weâ¦

797
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,074
decided to get divorced.

798
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,825
I'm sorry.

799
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,917
I'm not going to be
a troublemaking father.

800
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,424
I'll tell them proudly

801
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,586
after I fully recover.

802
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:38,295
He stood up for you
when people were bad-mouthing you.

803
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,097
We're not in that kind of relationship.

804
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,271
Eun-joo.

805
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,388
Try looking for your biological father.

806
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,400
He said he was dating someone.

807
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,320
He said she lives in Toronto,
but something feels off.

808
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,739
You know I love you very much, right?
