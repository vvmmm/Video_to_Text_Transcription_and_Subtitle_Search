I had some help. No question.

I mean, you're right here
with us, my friend.

42
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,774
I've been asking myself that
question for a very long time.

Did I really play
any part in it?

00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,041
You deserve everything
you've got.

49
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,293
And you shouldn't be made
to feel guilty about it.

You have no control.

And yet you're so assured
