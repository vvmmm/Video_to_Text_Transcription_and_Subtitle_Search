FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,822
The time when I was too patheticâ¦

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,821
WRITE 3 PAGES EVERYDAY

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,952
â¦and couldn't meet anyone.

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,457
{\an8}DON'T BE AFRAID.
DON'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE.

7
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,710
I used to plant a single seedâ¦

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,801
and waited forâ¦

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,883
the fruit to grow.

10
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,156
EUN-HEE'S

11
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,285
TRASH

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,790
EMPTY

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,796
DO YOU WANT TO EMPTY THE TRASH?

14
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,802
EMPTY TRASH

15
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,989
After ending my nine-year relationship,

16
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,752
the 30-year-old me,
had nothing to offer to the world.

17
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,535
To change my life, the first thing I did

18
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,133
was move out.

19
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,338
What do you think?

20
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,810
Isn't it spacious?

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,018
Yes.

22
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,562
It's nice.

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,412
I'm leaving.

24
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
Moving out from my family

25
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,203
was too simple,

26
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,957
and the fence keeping the family

27
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,419
was too loose,

28
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,875
so I felt even lonelier.

29
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,383
What is it all of a sudden?

30
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,431
I felt anxious all of a sudden

31
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,428
I couldn't stay home, so I came outside.

32
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,932
Ma'am, we will tell you inside the house.

33
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
EUN-JOO

34
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,113
ELDEST DAUGHTER

35
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,116
Yes.

36
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,278
Is Tae-hyung there?

37
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,834
Yes.

38
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,038
I'm almost near the house.

39
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,541
Tell him to wait.

40
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,219
I heard you're coming to my house,
so I called Eun-joo.

41
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,591
She's almost here.

42
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,719
Then you should go inside.

43
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,514
I'll go in with her when she comes.

44
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,314
Okay.

45
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,089
I didn't tell her yet.

46
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:23,338
Do you wish to end things here and there
on your own, like doing homework?

47
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,134
You said you'll tell her last time.

48
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,795
I thought it was rude for me

49
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,971
to not visit her once you told her.

50
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,847
I couldn't tell her on that day.

51
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,363
It turned into a somewhat
noisy family occasion.

52
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,482
I'm going to refrain
from being the party pooper from now on.

53
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,065
When I heard you were going with Eun-hee,

54
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,318
I did worry that would happen.

55
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,540
You really were a family.

56
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,205
You know too well.

57
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,799
We were family.

58
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,375
To my family,

59
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,425
you've always been a guest,

60
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,179
but to your familyâ¦

61
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,972
I was their family
the moment I stepped intoâ¦

62
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,272
that house.

63
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,672
Come in.

64
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,033
Sit comfortably.

65
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,660
Mother.

66
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,709
Weâ¦

67
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,884
decided to get divorced.

68
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,469
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,400
Why?

70
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,396
We can't be together anymore.

71
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,275
Our love for each other has disappeared.

72
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,698
You answer me.

73
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,495
What could be
a more certain reason than that?

74
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,669
We can't love each other
as a man and a woman anymore.

75
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,209
It's meaningless to be together.

76
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,172
Iâ¦

77
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,880
I know my daughter.

78
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,967
If you showed that much love,
considering your personality,

79
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,890
it means you liked him very much.

80
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,010
It's the same now.

81
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,557
Coming here as a couple and sitting there.

82
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,059
You can't do that to someone

83
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,767
who doesn't love you anymore.

84
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,736
You.

85
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,486
Is there another woman?

86
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,374
That's not what it is, Mom.

87
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,578
No.

88
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,079
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,786
If you're sorry, tell me the reason.

90
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,154
I found my family uncomfortable
and hated them,

91
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,073
so I got married to run away from them.

92
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,660
I got the wrong idea
that Eun-joo chose to marry me

93
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,778
for the same reason.

94
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,053
You got marriedâ¦

95
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,430
because you hated your family?

96
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,519
Is thatâ¦

97
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,771
what you mean?

98
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,900
Eun-joo.

99
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,649
Is that what he means?

100
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,987
I still find my family uncomfortable
and can't stand them.

101
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,622
But I learned that

102
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,379
Eun-joo loves and treasures her family.

103
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,841
I hardly knew anythingâ¦

104
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,799
about Eun-joo.

105
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,519
I thought we could live
together like friends.

106
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,481
I realized Eun-joo doesn't need a friend,

107
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,074
but someone to love instead.

108
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,778
I wasn't qualified
from the very beginning.

109
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,502
Everything is my fault.

110
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,963
I canât make Eun-joo
more miserable than she is now,

111
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,004
and I want her to start over,

112
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,258
so we decided to part ways.

113
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,446
I promised myself

114
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,738
that when I become a mother,

115
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,031
I will let my children live freely,

116
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,787
will not discriminate
against my daughters,

117
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,752
and let them do whatever they want to do.

118
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,789
But when it became a realityâ¦

119
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,424
it was hard to do so.

120
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,851
I'm sorry, Mom.

121
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,930
Iâ¦

122
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,226
I will try to live my life.

123
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,487
You are capable,

124
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,412
so it would've been easier
for you than for me,

125
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,655
but seeing you twoâ¦

126
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,584
parting ways so suddenly and vainly,

127
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,800
it seems like it was my fault

128
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,049
to mention graduation from marriageâ¦

129
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,382
How is it your fault?

130
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,141
Thanks to youâ¦

131
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,271
I'm enduring it so well.

132
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,982
The child whom everyone wanted aborted,

133
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,731
survived so well thanks to her brave mom.

134
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,476
Don't you thinkâ¦

135
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,859
it's a waste to see that daughter
being forced to live a fake life?

136
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,501
People might thinkâ¦

137
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,590
you're 20 years old when they see you.

138
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,220
My precious daughter.

139
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,339
No one sees me like that.

140
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,386
It's been a few years
since kids started calling me an old lady.

141
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,521
You don't look old at all.

142
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,864
Youâ¦

143
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,444
Want to live with me?

144
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,698
I'm thankful

145
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,737
that you accepted it
more easily than I thought,

146
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,698
but still, that's not right.

147
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,590
Eun-joo.

148
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,642
Your fatherâ¦

149
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,933
knows that you know.

150
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,060
I told him.

151
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,739
Good.

152
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,569
Would you like me

153
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,067
to tell him about this?

154
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,779
No.

155
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,374
I'll go see him with Eun-hee.

156
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,080
And see how he's doing too.

157
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,206
Momâ¦

158
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,182
just think about yourself now.

159
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,498
I hardly knew anything

160
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,076
about Eun-joo.

161
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,799
Yes.

162
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,132
We hardly knew anything

163
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,717
about each other.

164
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,169
Thisâ¦

165
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,503
Wash.

166
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,092
CEO.

167
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,428
There's something you don't
know about Ji-woo.

168
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,353
What?

169
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,601
I saw his social media
and something seemed weird.

170
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,648
You know how I get obsessive
when I'm curious.

171
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,189
I searched everything from social media
to game usernames and found her.

172
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,534
Who?

173
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,699
He said he was dating someone
and that she was a bit far away.

174
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,069
She's his first love
from school or something.

175
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,026
Isn't that a common story
for those who use social media?

176
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,754
Something feels off.

177
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,208
Someone's first love is always
a target to be attacked, right?

178
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,920
It's not like that.

179
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,710
I heard she lives in Toronto,
but nothing seems right.

180
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,915
She has more than 800 friends worldwide.

181
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,376
Is she the UN?

182
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,215
I don't like bad-mouthing people.

183
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,140
If you're curious, go ask Ji-woo yourself.

184
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,557
Why would I ask him?
It has nothing to do with me.

185
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,277
I could've crawled here faster.

186
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,914
The CEO there kept asking me questions,
so I answered them.

187
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,742
He says I'm the only friendly one.

188
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,458
He said you're exceptionally scary.

189
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,419
Then should I smile while I'm working?

190
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,040
You should smile more.

191
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,600
When is your driving test?

192
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,273
Why?

193
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,481
Eun-hee asked me.

194
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:13,534
She should just ask me if she's curious.
What's the point of asking through you?

195
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,400
I guess she wants to give youâ¦

196
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,449
Taffy to wish you success.

197
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,209
Ms. Kim. We don't need
to do a separate meeting, right?

198
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,090
Why not?

199
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,302
I said I wish to quit this year
during my salary negotiations last year.

200
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,007
And then you said you can't
work at a publishing company

201
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,807
that's obsessed with English study books.

202
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,310
I know I get paid every month
for selling study books.

203
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,476
I never said that. Not even in my dreams.

204
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,987
Do you have a plan?

205
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,319
Yes.

206
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,788
I should've focused on
working in the office!

207
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,044
Listen to your friend!

208
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,285
Learn your lesson!

209
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,803
How did it go?

210
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,061
Chan-hyuk's test is today.

211
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,859
Don't youâ¦

212
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,374
regret what you told me?

213
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,950
I thought about it all night long.

214
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,538
I'm not the type of guy
that says things I might regret.

215
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,959
You must be happy because you're great.

216
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,957
When I heardâ¦

217
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,635
that you took me out of your heart
to see me before you went to sleep,

218
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,256
my heart raced too much to sleep.

219
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,229
As you said,

220
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,101
I took you out to see you in bed.

221
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,267
and it reminded me of myself
when I had cut ties with you.

222
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,492
I went to alumni reunions
where I thought you might come

223
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,989
and went to that bookstore
in Gwanghwamun a lot as well.

224
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,081
But I never ran into you.

225
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,415
I recalled the time I couldn't contact you

226
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,263
but looked for you.

227
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,843
If we ran into each other back then,

228
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,216
we might be wearing a ring
to commemorate our 1000th day.

229
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,192
At that timeâ¦

230
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,647
I thought Jong-pal left me

231
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,491
because the 30-year-old me back then

232
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,285
was pathetic, incapable, and didn't
have a good family background.

233
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,831
I wanted to change my life.

234
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,205
Write three pages a day,
which is 100 pages in a month.

235
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,088
Read 100 pages of a book every day.

236
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,836
Only plans.

237
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,632
I only had plans.

238
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,257
You know that kids with bad grades

239
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,971
work hard on their schedules, right?

240
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,055
Well begun is half done.

241
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,900
Half?

242
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,069
I achieve everything in my mind.

243
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,161
I read it before I cleaned
the entire house,

244
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,325
and nothing was finished properly.

245
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,664
I always write the beginning only.

246
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,366
I have no talent.

247
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,998
When I'm at work, I laugh and chat,
worry about my bosses and co-workers,

248
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,129
and make mistakes.

249
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,930
Aren't you self-reflecting
a little too much in front of your friend

250
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,772
who's about to get a government license?

251
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,677
Yes.

252
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,772
I am self-reflecting.

253
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,275
I got to like the ordinary days

254
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,488
a little bit.

255
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,776
This ring has that meaning.

256
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,698
A gift for myself.

257
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,867
Loving myself, starting today.

258
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,591
Even so, my confidence is still low,

259
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,749
so I need to improve it first.

260
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,259
Then I can seriously think about

261
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,755
what you said to me.

262
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,215
Someone who truly has low confidence

263
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,727
canât say they have low confidence openly

264
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,100
like you just did.

265
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,310
Well, anyway,

266
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,108
I must date you, who decided
to love yourself,

267
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,200
starting today.

268
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,868
Should I get a ring for myself too?

269
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,081
Why are you so straightforward?
Going straight can only make you fail.

270
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,083
I can take it again.

271
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,750
Thanks to you

272
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,956
I think I can be cool about

273
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,469
this place as well.

274
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,604
I think it would hurt less too.

275
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,561
Yes.

276
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,606
Mr. Park Chan-hyuk?

277
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,939
Please get ready.

278
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,829
You must come
the day before the operation,

279
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,875
so we'll call you about the schedule.

280
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,788
If it's benign, then it's the best.

281
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,088
Even if it's malignant,

282
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,721
brain tumors these days
have a high recovery rate.

283
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,838
We will tell you the separate guidelines.

284
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,599
-Let's go.
-Doctor.

285
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:19,023
Does that mean
the reason my memories got mixed up

286
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,440
wasn't the accident?

287
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,979
The tumor moved a bit,

288
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,114
and it was pressing the part
in charge of memories.

289
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,322
I got my memories back now,

290
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,952
but can I lose them again
if I don't get the surgery?

291
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,951
If the tumor grows a bit bigger
and puts more pressure on the brain,

292
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,865
it can cause trouble with your memory.

293
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,875
Ms. Sook?

294
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,550
Were you shocked
thinking I turned back to 22 again?

295
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,810
I'm sorry.

296
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,848
Iâ¦

297
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,106
need to adjust my workload

298
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,189
and clean my truck too, soâ¦

299
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,073
Let's book the surgery after that.

300
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,203
Do what the hospital tells you to do.

301
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,083
They said the surgery isn't difficult.

302
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,697
You didn't drink or smoke.

303
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,497
You even climbed all the mountains
in Korea at least once.

304
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,251
so I'm sure you can overcome that.

305
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,793
I climbed all of them once?

306
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,424
I climbed them at least 12 times.

307
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,415
I didn't even touch alcohol or cigarettes.

308
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,297
I know I shouldn't say this,

309
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,255
but I'm as solid as a rock.

310
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,023
I'm proud of you.

311
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,231
Weâ¦

312
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,563
graduated from marriage.

313
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,527
I'll take care of things myself.

314
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,908
You've been chasing me around
with a flower in your hands,

315
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,580
and you say that now?

316
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,658
See? One flower wasn't enough for you.

317
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,956
I should've given you a bouquet.

318
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,879
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

319
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,250
Don't tell jokes to let it pass.

320
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,588
Think about it in my shoes.

321
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,133
If I'm sick, can you

322
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,966
tell me to take care of things myself?

323
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,773
If you don't want the kids to find out,
get surgery quickly.

324
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,979
Get well and live freely, okay?

325
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,994
Hi.

326
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,945
Hi.

327
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,351
I made my daughter join
such a horrible familyâ¦

328
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,186
Was there someone you know among them?

329
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,189
No.

330
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,308
There wasn't.

331
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,395
It was a stranger.

332
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,901
A total stranger.

333
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,985
Let's go.

334
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,702
No. 3, you passed.

335
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,325
Congratulations.

336
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,879
I promised, right?

337
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,669
I'll help you with practicing.

338
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:36,842
I will coach you strictly,
so prepare yourself.

339
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,173
Okay.

340
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,008
I saw on social media
that couples have quarrels

341
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,354
when coaching each other with driving.

342
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,770
I guess it's time for us
to start doing that, right?

343
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,281
Can I see that too, please?

344
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,448
Shall I take all of them
out for you, then?

345
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,170
I'm sorry, can you show me
the one on the frontâ¦

346
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,541
-This one?
-Yes.

347
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,600
When you're oldâ¦

348
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,096
even an appendectomy can be difficult.

349
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,446
Mom.

350
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,201
Why?

351
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,913
Mom.

352
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,333
Why?

353
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,581
Mom, you know how much I love you, right?

354
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,844
Mom.

355
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,843
Tell Dad to come back home.

356
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,425
Get your arms off me.

357
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,193
Did Dad say something?

358
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,566
No.

359
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,611
I need to move out too.

360
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,489
You said you'll never.

361
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,570
Wellâ¦

362
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,279
I even have some friends who are married.

363
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,656
I have to be on my own.

364
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,333
What is this?

365
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,049
Young-sik.

366
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,836
Go back to Ulsan.

367
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,553
She might come back
because she misses the kid.

368
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,313
If you don't want to go back,
then let's settle down here.

369
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,061
Please, no.

370
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,193
The sea of Incheon looks terrible.

371
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,105
I'm going to go back to Ulsan.

372
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,862
You show people how you feel

373
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,407
and smile all the time.

374
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,580
But why were you so harsh
to your wife, the mother of your child?

375
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,833
Wait.

376
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,422
How did you know, Dad?

377
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,884
It's because you're just like me.

378
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,048
Your leg.

379
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,973
You're ashamed about itâ¦

380
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,721
so you were afraid she might
run away because of it, right?

381
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,515
I wasn't happy doing that, either.

382
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,521
You must learn how precious your wife is,

383
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,153
so just wait.

384
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,074
I need toâ¦

385
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,493
go someplace now.

386
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,199
Where are you going?

387
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,165
Are you looking for a specific law firm?

388
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,627
There's a floor guide here,

389
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,847
and there's Yoo Min-woo
Patent Law Firm here.

390
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,969
And I'm Yoo Min-woo. Nice to meet you.

391
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,266
CHIEF YOO MIN-WOO

392
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,889
I'm not here for a patent.

393
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,646
-Oh, but still. Take it.
-Okay.

394
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,073
If you need patent counseling, call me.

395
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,978
If anyone looks like they need me,
then introduce them to me.

396
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,281
-Okay.
-Okay.

397
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,823
I heard there's a lounge here.
Which floor is it on?

398
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,116
I'm actually on my way there now.

399
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,292
-Let's go.
-Okay.

400
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,160
What made you want to go to the lounge?

401
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,996
-Wellâ¦
-To take a break?

402
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,002
No, that's not why.

403
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,375
Part-timers and employees
aren't too different.

404
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,172
Some things are different like

405
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,585
medical insurance and unemployment
benefits.

406
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,385
Do you not want to be
an official employee here?

407
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,049
That makes me sad.

408
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,097
Come on, that's not why.

409
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,102
I love you so much.

410
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,694
You're confessing your love
during career counseling?

411
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,729
Iâ¦

412
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,725
wish to live freely as a freelancer.

413
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,364
Is it because

414
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,735
you like me so much,
and you feel sorry to be paid?

415
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,865
Yes, that's right.

416
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,619
Ask him.

417
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,424
CEO, you don't have tons of money, do you?

418
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,960
Don't try to persuade the kid

419
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,963
-The kid?
-to be an official employee.

420
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,723
I guess he doesn't need
medical insurance and so on.

421
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,469
Maybe he wants to go abroad.

422
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,056
I'll think about it.

423
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,693
Ms. Kim is working again.

424
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,197
Which Ms. Kim?

425
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,029
Ms. Kim Eun-joo. She got divorced.

426
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,744
I'm sure that smart woman
made sure she got alimony.

427
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,155
If so, is she single now?

428
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,044
I guess I must comfort her.

429
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,911
Let's invite her for a drink.

430
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,458
If she's looking for work here and there,
it means she needs money, right?

431
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,963
There are tons of other places
that need true comforting.

432
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,917
Attorney Kim isn't looking for work.

433
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,377
All the firms are competing to hire her.

434
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,928
Yuna Kim and Kim Yeon-Koung,
the sports queens.

435
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,142
She's on the same level.

436
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,021
Yuna Kim retired a long time ago.

437
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,768
A legend never dies.

438
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,350
Patent Attorney Kim isn't really a legend.

439
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,306
-She isn't.
-Now,

440
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,265
the most important thing

441
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,315
is how to win a lawsuit against
a powerful and large conglomerate.

442
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,610
Let's talk about that.

443
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,204
but I think it won't be easy

444
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,109
like how it was last time.

445
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,528
Patent Attorney Kim Eun-joo!

446
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,578
Your sister is here.

447
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,872
-Let's go to the meeting room.
-Okay.

448
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,088
Did you wait long?

449
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,184
No.

450
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,926
Continue with your conversation.

451
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,227
You're Patent Attorney Kim's sister?

452
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,348
I've always wanted to meet you.

453
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,805
We'reâ¦

454
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,725
like avatars, you know.

455
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,478
Avatars.

456
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,026
If my sister was a traineeâ¦

457
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,780
It was around ten years ago.

458
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,821
You still remember
what she said back then?

459
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,115
Since then and until now,

460
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,988
all the words Patent Attorney Kim said

461
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,155
are like quotations, so once I hear them,
I can never forget them.

462
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,656
They're arrows, not words.

463
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,253
Anyway,

464
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,554
ten years ago was
when my youth was at its peak.

465
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,720
I was also enjoying my youth
for the joy of passing the exam,

466
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,640
so I wasnât hard-working
during my trainee days.

467
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,219
But I'm glad I had fun at that time.

468
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,476
Right now, my work controls my life.

469
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,519
If I see anyone
who wants to have this job,

470
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,362
I will stop them at all costs.

471
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,898
I miss that time.

472
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,322
At that timeâ¦

473
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,663
I could drink two bottles of soju
with some anchovy broth.

474
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:04,294
Back then, I could easily drink
three bottles of soju with some kkakdugi.

475
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,620
I could drink four with beef soup.

476
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,866
Five bottles with pickled radish.

477
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,537
Six bottles with red pepper paste.

478
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,705
Was it seven or eight?
I don't quite remember.

479
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,973
Right. My sister hates heavy drinkers.

480
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,470
Right. Your younger sister
is a heavy drinker.

481
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,513
I can't even drink half a bottle nowadays.

482
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,847
It's too much.

483
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,311
No, I don't drink anymore.
I can't drink anymore.

484
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,732
Patent Attorney Kim.

485
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,980
Hereâ¦

486
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,398
This realtor's office
is a trustworthy one.

487
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,282
I consulted them to downsize my office,

488
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,029
and I thought you'd be
looking for a new office.

489
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,992
Here, take a look.

490
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,321
I got one.

491
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,236
Right.

492
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,409
You're always on top of things.

493
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,748
Are you starting your own office?

494
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,999
-A chief.
-A chief.

495
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,795
She'll be chief just like me.

496
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,218
So you two were close enough

497
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,048
to talk behind my back
when you were trainees?

498
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,934
He stood up for you
when people were bad-mouthing you.

499
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,307
We're not in that kind of relationship.

500
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,404
His drinking habits reminded me
of you at get-togethers,

501
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,651
so I told him, "You're like my sister."

502
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,783
What was that drinking habit
that reminded you of me?

503
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,111
He made a mistake
and made things complicated.

504
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,278
But he asked me to criticize nicely.

505
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,657
He said he made more mistakes
because I scare him.

506
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,044
Right.

507
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,753
I totally understand how he feels.

508
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,461
He keeps repeating the same mistakes,
so he needs the pain to stop entirely.

509
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,803
I have to point it out.

510
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,759
Pointing things out is painful.
It can't be nice.

511
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,304
That's enough.

512
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,224
My sister, that's your problem.

513
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,722
No one makes mistakes
because they like to make them.

514
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,885
When they realize their mistakes,
it breaks their hearts.

515
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,976
But you pour salt on the wound

516
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,982
without any change
in your facial expression.

517
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,235
That hurts.

518
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,816
Okay, let's stop here.

519
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,244
I'll stop.

520
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,740
What's that ring?

521
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,044
It's notâ¦

522
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,580
from that man who was
in front of your house, is it?

523
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,455
What's with the question?

524
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,672
What's upsetting you this time?

525
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,422
You didn't even see him that much.

526
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,088
What's with the face?

527
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,175
Do as you wish.

528
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,678
-It's not from him. We broke up.
-That's good.

529
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,143
-Eun-joo.
-You broke up with him,

530
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,734
so what's that ring?

531
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,604
You said I'm cowardly.

532
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,018
I wanted to fix that,

533
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,318
so I bought it in order to love myself.

534
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,199
What now? What about it is pathetic?

535
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,991
From what I see

536
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,124
you love yourself enough already.

537
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,081
So why put on a ring
to love yourself more?

538
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,293
Don't say that to others.
They'll say you're immature.

539
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,961
I told someone already.

540
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,049
By the wayâ¦

541
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,974
do we have to go so suddenly like thisâ¦

542
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,548
We should. Yes.

543
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,060
We should go.

544
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,899
What is this?

545
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,647
What a lovely color.

546
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,127
Dad.

547
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,048
Yong-gyoo!

548
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,054
I came with Eun-joo.

549
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,479
I told Eun-hee not to tell you

550
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,395
because I was afraid you might
feel uncomfortable coming here.

551
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,613
I'm going to move soon.

552
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,448
Mom's heart will break
if she sees you living here.

553
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,616
I'm going to move soon.

554
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,963
They're going back to Ulsan,
and I'm going to move too.

555
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,790
I saw that there are houses equipped
with refrigerators,

556
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,997
washing machines, and air conditioners.

557
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,798
Use the money in the bankbook you took.

558
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,507
You should know
if you thought about it in my shoes.

559
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,177
If you calculate it in terms of
paying off debt to me,

560
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,814
then I must calculate it
starting from my birth.

561
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,038
Yes.

562
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,995
Okay.

563
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,328
I will use that money.

564
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,838
That's enough to get a place tomorrow.

565
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,631
Then get it tomorrow.

566
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,009
Eun-joo.

567
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,483
Try looking for your biological father.

568
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,194
I'm not doing that.

569
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,816
If you're saying that because of meâ¦

570
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,074
No.

571
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,369
I'm sure there's a reason why
Mom didn't look for him all her life.

572
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,038
I'm sure it was purely because of me.

573
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,626
At firstâ¦

574
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,218
I thought I couldn't ask for more

575
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,970
if your mother was with me.

576
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,720
But thenâ¦

577
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,266
I heard people whispering

578
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,153
that they couldn't understand
why your mother,

579
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,571
who lacks nothing,
married someone like me.

580
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,395
That was when I became a loser.

581
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,873
I suspected that she might
be curious about your father

582
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,003
and that she'd contact him.

583
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,576
That's an incurable disease.

584
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,966
I did something so shameful
I can't even hide from it.

585
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,272
Find your father if you want to.

586
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,781
You have to know everything
and make things clear.

587
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,991
I know your personality.

588
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,604
Is she eating well?

589
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,831
You said you'd leave after drinking water.
Why are you still here?

590
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,420
Did you tell Dad about the divorce?

591
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,665
He says everything's his fault

592
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,715
no matter what the subject is.

593
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,586
I'm afraid he would say
my divorce is his fault too,

594
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,217
so I'm going to tell him later.

595
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,351
Yes, well done.

596
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,396
Donât make that face. Go.

597
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,858
You know because you live alone too.

598
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,993
Being alone can be good at times.

599
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,161
All right.

600
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,912
By the way, about our Dad,

601
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,452
I never knew he liked
taking photos that much.

602
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,826
I thought he only took flower photos.

603
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,544
I guess we are flowers to him.

604
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,797
Eun-joo.

605
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,208
Don't do that.

606
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,126
A sudden change in a person means death.

607
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,297
Bye.

608
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,983
Hey, Chan-pal!

609
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,738
You should've waited inside.

610
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,373
Why are you standing here?

611
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,120
Did you miss me that much?

612
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,004
I didn't want to waste my money on tea.

613
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,961
That's too practical.

614
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,003
What?

615
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,224
By the wayâ¦

616
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,218
why did you come all the way here?

617
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,840
If we can't see each other often,

618
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,927
we should see each other
when there's time.

619
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,972
Wouldn't that make your decision easier?

620
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,022
Heyâ¦

621
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,020
Have you always been soâ¦

622
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,272
This is a bitâ¦

623
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,864
I'm still a bitâ¦

624
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,770
Actuallyâ¦

625
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,858
I'm here because of Ji-woo.

626
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,703
Oh.

627
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,833
So it's a matter of an employee.

628
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,328
What is it?

629
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,750
Ji-woo doesn't want to be
an official employee.

630
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,709
Why not? It looked like
he's been waiting so long.

631
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,170
Have you heard anything about
Ji-woo's girlfriend?

632
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,722
I only thought of him as the little kid,

633
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,220
but I guess he's old enough
to have a girlfriend.

634
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,473
Did he tell you?

635
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,854
How can he treat his sister like thisâ¦

636
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,851
He didn't tell me, either.

637
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,853
It looks like Seo-young knows a bit.

638
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,935
Is it because they're the same generation
and they can understand?

639
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,612
Thinking about it,

640
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,780
the families don't know much
about who's dating who, do they?

641
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,532
Is that so?

642
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,113
He's not a kid.

643
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,118
Let him do what he wants
to do in his life.

644
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,737
Right?

645
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,577
What do you want to eat?
Let's go have something delicious.

646
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,998
What should we eat?

647
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,382
Pyongyang naengmyeon?

648
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,050
Fast food.

649
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,128
Fast food?

650
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,598
What do you want?

651
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,354
How about tteokbokki?

652
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,555
-Fast food?
-Yes.

653
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,560
Kkakdugi.

654
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,357
Anchovies.

655
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,857
Soy sauce boiled beef.

656
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,200
The table isn't colossal.

657
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,910
It can't be too far to reach.

658
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,990
Just eat it as it's set.

659
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,287
-Let's eat.
-Yes.

660
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,329
Thank you for the food.

661
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,560
Here.

YOON TAE-HYUNG FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC

670
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,834
Hi.

671
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,138
If it's hard for you to take care of this,
give it to your mother.

672
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,020
That's so like you.

673
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,939
Finishing everything accurately.

674
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,914
Do you even know enough
about me to say that?

675
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,751
Put yourself in my shoes.

676
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,503
You'd understand that I can't forgive you.

677
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,036
Mistakes.

678
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,628
Bad lies.

679
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,763
Fraud.

680
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,508
I'm sick of suffering them
again and again,

681
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,302
so I'm going to focus on my life.

682
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,932
So what I did to youâ¦

683
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,649
was a mistake, a bad lie, and a fraud.

684
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,653
I now understand it clearly.

685
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,703
I'm sorry.

686
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,405
Don't ever

687
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,043
do that again to anyone else.

688
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,002
Don't ever do that again.

689
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,896
MOTHER-IN-LAW

690
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,681
Don't worry too much.

691
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,433
I feel like I can fly,
both physically and mentally.

692
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,104
Are you sure you don't
want to tell the kids?

693
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,977
I'm not going to be
a troublemaking father.

694
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,895
I'll tell them proudly

695
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,493
after I fully recover.

696
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,412
Iâ¦

697
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,582
I need to do something.

698
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,411
Okay.

699
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,826
You don't need to come today.

700
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,584
You don't have to
do anything for me today.

701
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,838
Go and do your thing.

702
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,474
I'll be back.

703
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,476
I heard

704
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,936
that you accepted
the attorney's opinion on the alimony.

705
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,607
I don't want to have a lengthy fight.

706
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,487
You wanted me to apologize to you?

707
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,124
Not anymore.

708
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,866
You lost your chance.

709
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,125
I know you're not the type to tell,

710
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,010
but I want you to keep the reason
for the divorce a secret.

711
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,143
You got everything you want,

712
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,014
so now you apologize
and even ask for a favor.

713
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,770
A divorced man.

714
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,610
That can serve as a barrier
to keeping the family from worrying.

715
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,532
To do that for his familyâ¦

716
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,865
Tae-hyung went to my parents' house

717
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,908
and kneeled like a sinner.

718
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,655
He said it's all his fault.

719
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,751
He couldn't even lift his head.

720
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,007
I believeâ¦

721
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,843
that you're even more heartbroken

722
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:42,972
than I am.

723
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,593
Sang-sik had to get a loan to buy it,

724
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,381
but he was extremely happy
after buying this truck.

725
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,626
It has a name too.

726
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,047
A name?

727
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,385
It's Lucky.

728
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,010
Whenever he drove it, he used to say,

729
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,718
"Go, Lucky!"

730
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,190
If we sell it without consulting himâ¦

731
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,561
he's going to kill me.

732
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,476
He looks soft,

733
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,404
but when he gets angry,
he's blinded by his anger.

734
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,944
You know it more than I do.

735
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,318
I'm scarier than him when I get angry.

736
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,449
I'm worried he might say he wants to
drive again when he sees the truck.

737
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,666
Dying on his own is okay,
but I'm afraid he might harm someone.

738
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,532
WEDDING INVITATION

739
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,418
Sang-sik.

740
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,171
That's enough.
The wedding hall is going to explode.

741
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,716
I'm going to write down everyone
who comes to my mind.

742
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,390
About 100 people.

743
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,799
What? Are you starting a political party?

744
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,428
Even if I invite 100 people,
some of them might not be able to come.

745
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,186
I have no relatives.
I need this many people to come.

746
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,158
Yes, Eun-joo.

747
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,818
Dad, you're on your break, right?

748
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,448
I just ate and I'm writing

749
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,120
a list of invitees for the wedding.

750
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,714
How many do you want?

751
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,999
Just 50.

752
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,042
Give me 100.

753
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,835
I need at least 100.

754
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,633
Dad.

755
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,133
The wedding hall is small.

756
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,642
And people these days
only invite closest friends.

757
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:30,854
Really?

758
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,759
I'll leave room for ten people.

759
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,981
And I'll give you ten invitations.

760
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,944
Okay.

761
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,149
Ten.

762
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,611
Okay.

763
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,951
What about breakfast?

764
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,319
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

765
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,284
Eun-joo's wedding invitations are out.

766
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,408
She left some for you.

767
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,500
I'm not inviting anyone.

768
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,759
You can use the ones left for me.

769
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,879
People these days don't invite
that many people to weddings.

770
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,637
Don't make Eun-joo worry.

771
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,853
Our eldest daughter
got skinny with her wedding coming up,

772
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,682
so why would I make her worry?

773
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,978
I can't invite just a few.

774
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,111
So I'm going to let it pass quietly.

775
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,358
But if you donât invite anyone,
Eun-joo won't feel comfortable.

776
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,572
I'm doing it to make
my daughter feel comfortable.

777
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,572
She won't know if I don't tell her.
So you stay quiet!

778
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,951
The bride is too busy to care
about her father's friends.

779
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,501
WEDDING INVITATION

780
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,594
HANSEONG NEUROPSYCHIATRY DEPARTMENT
MEDICAL NOTE

781
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,244
Happy occasion.

782
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,111
The stir-fried anchovies are delicious.

783
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,621
Sad occasion.

784
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,752
My kids aren't calling me.

785
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,791
Angry occasion.

786
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,833
Myself.

787
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,706
Happy occasion.

788
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,217
Bulgogi.

789
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,549
Sad occasion.

790
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,434
I can't sleep.

791
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,351
Angry occasion.

792
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,639
Myself.

793
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,980
I talked to my eldest daughter
on the phone.

794
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,605
She told me to give out
only ten wedding invitations.

795
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,865
Angry occasion.

796
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,174
Myself.

797
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,093
She hid fruits.

798
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,670
Do you even think it's a waste
for me to eat fruits?

799
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:53,667
Yes!

800
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,592
I do!

801
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,266
I've been driving all night long,

802
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,113
and you want me to go out
and make money right away?

803
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,043
I want to die.

804
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,379
WRITE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW

805
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,633
I WANT TO DIE

806
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,858
Youâ¦

807
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,072
You said you look up
to your father, right?

808
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,362
Because in this world,

809
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,816
social connections and diplomas
mean everything,

810
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,367
but he worked and provided
for his family on this own.

811
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,833
You were never intimidated
when you talked about him.

812
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,206
I saw

813
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,166
him at the hospital.

814
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,262
I didnât say hi.

815
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,722
We're not in-laws anymore.

816
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,176
But I thought I should tell you at least.

817
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,314
Please think of this as my apology.

818
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,403
If you work as a doctor for a long time,

819
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,267
I can tell if someone hasâ¦

820
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,817
a serious illness or not
just by looking at the face.

821
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,823
Were my parents there together?

822
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,743
Yes.

823
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,656
I must keep confidentiality,

824
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,124
so I won't tell you anymore.

825
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,168
It looks likeâ¦

826
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,329
they decided not to tell their children.

827
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,508
Parentsâ¦

828
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,974
sometimes make decisions like that.

829
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,857
Find out about it in any way possible.

830
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,860
Okay.

831
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,401
Right now.

832
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,997
We're here, so we need to take a photo.

833
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,541
Yes.

834
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,594
-Go stand.
-All right, stand together.

835
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,428
-Eun-hee.
-Yes.

836
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,219
Take one with Eun-joo and me.

837
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,386
Okay, here we go.

838
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,309
You need to smile.

839
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,345
Okay, smile!

840
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,228
One, two, three!

841
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,002
Oh.

842
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,168
What were you doing?

843
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,804
Isn't it obvious? I was at a bank.

844
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,208
I did bank things.

845
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,715
About that girlfriend of yours in Torontoâ¦

846
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,716
When did you start dating her?

847
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,138
She's from the same school.

848
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,191
Howâ¦

849
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,361
How did you know she's in Toronto?

850
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,154
I'm not stupid. I can look things up.

851
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,406
Have you been keeping in touch
with her since she went to Toronto?

852
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,080
No, it wasn't like that.

853
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,701
We chatted while gaming

854
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,706
and we really hit it off
so we messaged each other separately.

855
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,289
And it was her.

856
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,794
We were both shocked.

857
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,129
So you ran into her in a game?

858
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,550
Why did you send her money?

859
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,587
Money?

860
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,217
You were at the currency exchange.

861
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,639
Oh. That.

862
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,690
No more questions, please.

863
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,400
Let's respect each other's privacy.

864
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,584
Someone might think he quit working here.

865
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,872
Why is his desk so empty?

866
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,872
Chan-hyuk, I'm at the airport.

867
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,369
I'm sending you a message
before I board the plane.

868
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,955
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you

869
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,210
the biggest decision
in the 26 years of my life.

870
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,840
If you knew about it,

871
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,961
it would've grown into something big.

872
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,886
I think my family
will stop me if I tell them,

873
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,599
so I'm running away now.

874
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,767
I've been planning this for a long time,

875
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,059
but I'm not all that happy.

876
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,983
I thought it'd be freeing
to leave my family,

877
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,904
but if you explain it to my sisters
and comfort them,

878
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,993
I'm sure they will make
Mom and Dad understand.

879
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,566
I'm sorry, Chan-hyuk.

880
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,934
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a message after the tone.

881
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,469
When you're finished recordingâ¦

882
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,688
What the heck?

883
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,771
What is it?

884
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,788
EUN-HEE

885
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,262
I'M RUNNING AWAY

886
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,631
I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR A LONG TIME

887
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,769
Whatâ¦

888
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,729
does this mean?

889
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:08,816
Let's go to the airport.

890
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,989
He's already on the plane.

891
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,818
He probably went to Toronto.

892
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,783
Seo-young said she'll find a way
to reach him via social media.

893
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,626
Was Iâ¦

894
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,179
nothing to Ji-woo?

895
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,600
Am I just a family
he wants to escape from?

896
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,064
What's going to happen to my family?

897
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,733
We seriously knewâ¦

898
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,572
nothing about each other.

899
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,595
Ji-woo is a grown-up.

900
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,269
He can leave anywhere if he wants.

901
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,978
Even if it's family,

902
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,110
if he wants to leave, then he can.

903
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,710
DEPARTMENT: NEUROSURGERY
PATIENT'S NAME: KIM SANG-SIK

904
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,545
DURATION: 8 HOURS AND 41 MINUTES

905
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,550
OPERATING CENTER

906
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,107
The surgery went well.

907
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,649
The location of the tumor was unideal,
so it took a long time.

908
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,442
We tried the best we can.

909
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,568
Let's keep an eye on his recovery.

910
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,575
Now everything depends on the patient.

911
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,987
Thank you.

912
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,497
Thank you so much.

913
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,327
It went well.

914
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,376
It went well. That's a relief, right?

915
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,683
Mr. Sang-sik.

916
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:53,983
Mr. Sang-sik.

917
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,689
-Dad.
-Dad.

918
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,282
-Dad.
-Mr. Sang-sik.

919
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,972
Mr. Sang-sik!

920
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,010
Code Blue for Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

921
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,313
Mr. Sang-sik!

922
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:29,805
Dad!

923
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,437
Why didnât they tell us?

924
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,946
I'm sure he couldn't even if he wanted to.

925
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,782
Ji-woo's first love disappeared.

926
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,787
I'm careful with my words
even to my family,

927
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,621
but with you, I feel relaxed.

928
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,958
Do we have to know everything
because we're family?

929
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:25,054
Then will they not tell us if something
happens because it might burden us?

930
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,052
Ms. Sook

931
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,183
I'm afraid that I might not be able to

932
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,757
return this time.
