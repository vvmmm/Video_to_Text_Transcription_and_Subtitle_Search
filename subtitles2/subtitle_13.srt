There's no point
keeping us captive here, Naad.

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,680
You won't be able to find
Raga Sanjivani without me.

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,360
The people who are after the raga...

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,640
will not let you live.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,880
You don't have to worry about that.

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,240
You killed my mom and Salamat Uncle.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Saaz...

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
I've brought you guys here
to save you.

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
- I love you Saaz, trust me.
- I don't trust you.

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,840
A killer can never...

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
He can never love someone.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,880
Do you know me?

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,040
How well do you know me?

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
Do you know how we survive?

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Does anyone here know?

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
Give me a chance.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,120
Make me a part of your life.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,480
Naad.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,480
I can love too, Saaz.

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
I can love too.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm capable of love too, Saaz.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,040
Go away.

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,920
- Saaz...
- Stay away.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,520
Believe me, Saaz.

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
Get lost.

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,440
- Get away from me...
- Saaz...

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,720
Go away.

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
- Don't come near me...
- Saaz, I...

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,560
Just get lost!

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
Go away.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
Love, my foot!

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
You can never love anyone.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,640
You can only harass people.

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,240
You can only break a glass
with your songs.

36
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,439
Can you win over people with your music
like Alap can?

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
Hey!

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
Shut up!

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Challenge?

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
You up for it?

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,560
Yes, I am.

42
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you ready?

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,840
Take me to the Shiva Temple.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,040
Let's see who finds Raga Sanjivani.

45
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Bring them to the temple.

46
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
Come.

47
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
Welcome.

48
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,080
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2

50
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
Come in.

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,800
Welcome to the Shiva Temple
of Rudrapur.

52
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,600
What's going on?

53
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,880
You're here as well?

54
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes.

55
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
It's me.

56
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm like the tanpura.

57
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,000
I guide the musician
from the background.

58
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,920
But then,
I'm not the director of this act.

59
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,160
In Amanat Khan's treasure of ragas

60
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,240
I'm one of the seven notes
like the rest of you.

61
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's gather everyone
and begin the musical game.

62
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Naad.

63
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
Shruti!

64
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Where are you taking me?

65
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Alap.

66
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Rudrabhairav, it'll be a grave sin.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,639
The holy temple of Rudrapur
contaminated by a whore.

68
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Hey!

69
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,040
I'll bury you alive
if you insult my mom again.

70
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Is this what you have taught your son?

71
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
Shame on you!

72
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It is an unforgivable sin, Rudrabhairav.

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,640
You can't create an idol of Goddess Durga
without soil from a brothel.

74
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,400
We must tolerate this sin
for some more time.

75
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
Maestro Sasikanta, you here?

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
Yes, me.

77
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm the director.

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,960
The master.

79
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
The master of Rudrapur.

80
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Your master Kedar Mishra...

81
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,640
was once the Naad of Rudrapur.

82
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,440
I was the Rudrabhairav then.

83
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,200
Please release me now.

84
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
But you are...

85
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,440
you're associated
with Gandhargarh School of Music.

86
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I deceived you.

87
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Besides my music...

88
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,320
I got involved in a murder
in my youth.

89
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,640
I had also vexed
an influential person.

90
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,160
He had provided the police
with evidence against me.

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,000
If they caught me,
they wouldn't just have buried me.

92
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,040
They would've hanged me to death.

93
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,240
So he ran away from Rudrapur

94
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,960
and took refuge in Gandhargarh.

95
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
Then I took on a new name...

96
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,560
Sasikanta Bharadwaj.

97
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Soon, I had fame, glory, respect.

98
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,040
But Master always maintained ties
with Rudrapur.

99
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
When Hemanta was in police custody...

100
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,640
one of our followers saw the symbol
of the rudrabina on his back.

101
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,080
He had informed us about it.

102
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,440
I've told you the secrets
of your master.

103
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,640
I know that your peers
are defaming you.

104
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,560
You were meant to receive
the national music award this year.

105
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,760
But Ranjan Ghosh got it instead of you.

106
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
Don't you want revenge?

107
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes, I do.

108
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
Then?

109
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
This is your golden opportunity.

110
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Join us.

111
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,920
What do I have to do?

112
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
First of all, tell us...

113
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,760
who else among your peers
has this symbol on their body?

114
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Um...

115
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Yes...

116
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,920
An old servant of the house
called Anadi.

117
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
So you forced Anadi...

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,280
to reveal all the names
and had them murdered.

119
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,800
You also verified the names
with a DNA test, right?

120
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Wow!

121
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,200
You know this as well?

122
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,920
I've never seen a detective who sings.

123
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Yes I did it.

124
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,000
I did it because unnecessary bloodshed
goes against our morality.

125
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
My goodness!

126
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
Morality!

127
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,680
Isn't lying against your morality?

128
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,000
You knew nothing about the notation.
You lied.

129
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,200
I admit it...

130
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
I admit I lied to you.

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,600
Amanat Khan used his brains
to compose it.

132
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,920
You used your brains to find it.

133
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,120
And I used my brains to copy it.

134
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
What a brilliant composition!

135
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,440
You're...

136
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
You're such a renowned musician.

137
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
You're our country's pride.

138
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
But you're so greedy.

139
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Greedy?

140
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,000
No.

141
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm not that greedy.

142
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,240
Believe me.

143
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
It's just that...

144
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,440
I'm greedy for my life.

145
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:07,480
The fame, glory and wealth
which I've earned throughout my life...

146
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,320
I want it all forever.

147
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm scared of death.

148
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,640
I can't share my glory with anyone.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
I can't share it.

150
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm the absolute authority of Rudrapur.

151
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Huge as the Himalayas.

152
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,640
Vast as the seas.

153
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,400
That's why I want
Tansen's Raga Sanjivani.

154
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I'll...

155
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,280
I'll be immortal.

156
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,200
I'll be immortal.

157
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,000
I know that it's not possible.

158
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,720
But I crave it.

159
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,240
It's the only thing I want.

160
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,840
I want to be immortal.

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,360
An artist becomes immortal
through his creations.

162
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,000
A greedy person like you
can never create something.

163
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
I know that!

164
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,360
I know everything.

165
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,040
I've seen the world
long before you.

166
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,440
I know that an artist becomes
immortal through his creations.

167
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,400
You can't create something
with a greedy mind.

168
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,880
But this coming from a foolish guy
like you is funny.

169
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,120
It's funny.

170
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,760
This is the Shiva lake.

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,080
Let's see you if you can find
Raga Sanjivani here.

172
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
Look for it.

173
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,280
"In the heart of Rudrapur
lies a Shiva lake.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760
When the discs are aligned

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,760
And the notes are played
at twice the pace of time

176
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,680
Raga Sanjivani you shall find."

177
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,520
I know all that.

178
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,200
We've followed the notation
but nothing happened.

179
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,360
You people play it now.

180
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,440
The discs are already in place.

181
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,760
Start playing.

182
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,840
What's this, Bahadur?

183
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,120
This was designed
by Madhubanti's grandfather.

184
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,760
Came to know about it
from the map of the temple.

185
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Basically, if the instruments are played
according to this notation...

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,080
then we'll find Raga Sanjivani.

187
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,440
"And the notes are played
at twice the pace of time

188
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,920
Raga Sanjivani you shall find."

189
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Hmm.

190
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
But why "at twice the pace of time"?

191
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,160
Look, Shruti.

192
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
The normal tempo of time
is 60 beats per minute.

193
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,880
So, "twice the pace of time" would be...

194
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Sixty into two.

195
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,040
- As in, 120 beats per minute.
- Right!

196
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,160
So, basically...

197
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,880
if the notation is played
at 120 beats per minute on every instrument

198
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
then we'll find Raga Sanjivani.

199
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Sarod.

200
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
Sitar.

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
Flute.

202
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,840
Santoor.

203
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
Shehnai.

204
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,680
Sarangi, rudrabina.

205
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
I get it.

206
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,760
But who will play the rudrabina?

207
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,960
A whore will play the rudrabina?

208
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,440
Is there any other way?

209
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,680
But...

210
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
But...

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,440
H-How did Rohini learn
to play the rudrabina?

212
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,160
Pandit Kedar Mishra secretly taught you
to play the rudrabina.

213
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
Isn't it, Mom?

214
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Hmmph!

215
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,600
Rohini...

216
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,720
the rudrabina is the king
of all instruments.

217
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,760
Earlier...

218
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,000
maestros taught the rudrabina
only to their sons or sons-in-law.

219
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,120
At my first music school...

220
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,160
girls were forbidden to touch
the rudrabina.

221
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,520
But I don't obey these rules now.

222
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
Among my students...

223
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,280
you're the only one who is worthy
of learning the rudrabina.

224
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
But...

225
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,360
you need a pure mind
to play the rudrabina.

226
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,240
If you play it with an impure mind...

227
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
a curse will befall you.

228
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,720
Nobody can escape the curse.

229
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,960
Nobody.

230
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,440
- What happened, Master?
- Hmm?

231
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,640
My master Amanat Khan...

232
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
gave me special instructions
while teaching the rudrabina.

233
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,400
He asked me to teach you
the rudrabina.

234
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,080
But don't tell anybody about it.

235
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,640
Got it?

236
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
No one lives in this house now.

237
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,720
Come secretly and take lessons
in the rudrabina from me.

238
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Okay?

239
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
There'll be some magic today.

240
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
Record everything.

241
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,040
Come on, get started.

242
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
(vocalising)

243
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,680
THIS SECRET BANDISH

244
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,160
IF YOU SING

245
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,360
FROM THE HEART

246
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,440
YOU SHALL PACIFY SHIVA'S "TANDAV"

247
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,920
THE BEATS OF "DADRA"

248
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
SHALL NULLIFY THE POISON

249
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,120
THEN RAGA SANJIVANI YOU SHALL FIND

250
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,639
THIS SECRET BANDISH
IF YOU SING FROM THE HEART

251
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,896
YOU SHALL PACIFY SHIVA's "TANDAV"

252
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,256
THE BEATS OF "DADRA"

THEN RAGA SANJIVANI
YOU SHALL FIND

254
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,400
Hey, what's this?

255
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Where is Raga Sanjivani?

256
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,680
Huh?

257
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,880
This secret "bandish"
if you sing from the heart

258
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,840
You pacify Shiva's "tandav".

259
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,640
The beats of "Dadra"
Shall nullify the poison.

260
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,040
Then you shall find Raga Sanjivani."
