SPECIAL JOINT INVESTIGATION MEETING

14
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:57,302
Hey, here they come!

15
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,727
Chief! What was
the meeting about?

16
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:03,766
- What are you investigating?
- Is Tatsumura involved?

17
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,849
There are rumors that Sanritsu
Industries is behind all this.

18
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,474
Isn't its president Tatsumura
the mastermind behind this incident?

19
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:12,499
Aren't you flooded with complaints about
police ineffectiveness in the case?

20
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,278
They say the authorities are too
cautious, or worse, weak-kneed.

21
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,363
I'll ask you the same question:
What do you guys think?

22
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:20,886
It's easy to criticize others.

23
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,417
But are you trying to bring back
the old, heavy-handed police power?

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,903
It's not as if cautious
investigation is bad.

25
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,155
And that's part of the
difficulty of this job.

26
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:34,160
It's not you who's been getting your
men killed at every turn, it's me.

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,830
Oh, hi.

28
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:46,871
The press?

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,254
Yeah. I got a little excited.

30
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,225
I went to the farewell ceremony
for Detective Sugiyama.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,248
I see. Well.

32
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,815
That's three in a row.

33
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,389
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

34
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:04,300
And...the meeting?

35
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,267
It's like we've hit a dead end.

36
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,455
We don't have a concrete plan.

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,235
All the violent incidents
in this neighborhood

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,120
are connected to
Sanritsu Industries.

39
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,937
I'm sure I'm on
the right track,

40
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:22,555
but I don't know where to start
to catch them by the tailâ¦

41
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,400
We don't have a single clue.

42
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,499
We're helpless. It's our own fault
that the city is calling us weak-kneed.

43
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,730
The three men who died
would turn in their graves.

BUSINESS INFORMATION

45
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,023
CHAIRMAN SAICHI SAKURA
PRESIDENT JÅªGO TATSUMURA

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,132
I just had an idea.

47
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,389
I heard a rumor on the street.

48
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:51,139
Tatsumura has recently taken
complete control of the organization.

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,303
They say things are getting
awkward with his uncle, Sakura.

50
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,408
Mmm-hmm... So?

51
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,162
If we can crack the organization by
successfully exploiting this opportunity,

52
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:04,458
we might be able to get some
clues for the investigation.

53
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:05,984
I see.

54
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,460
But that would require--

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,825
Of course.
We can't do it alone.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,001
We really need the help of a man
knowledgeable about the organization.

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,575
A kind of guerrilla operation.

59
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
Interesting idea,

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,150
but I don't know if there's anybody
who could be that useful.

61
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:26,090
I actually have a little
bit of an idea about that.

62
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,169
Oh? Who is it?

63
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,401
TOJIMA BROTHERS

64
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,930
Hello!

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Hello!

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,780
Coming!

67
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,817
Oh! Old man!

68
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:53,730
Hi.

69
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,270
Hi.

70
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,144
Welcome.

71
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:03,000
- Are you two working together?
- No.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,320
She wouldn't stop asking
me to show her how to fix it.

73
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,440
Boy, you look terrible!

74
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:07,786
Oh!

75
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,355
Did you have the ceremony yet?

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,716
No, not yet.

77
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,081
It seems rather silly
to call it a wedding now, butâ¦

78
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,150
- We'll invite you when we do, Mr. Ogata.
- Sure.

79
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,430
- Please come in.
- Okay.

80
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,849
It looks like two more cars have been
added after not coming here for a while.

81
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,490
But the two drivers are unavailable,
so they're just like decorations now.

82
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,202
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

83
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,440
Hard-working, kind-heartedâ¦

84
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,124
She'll make a good wife.

85
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:38,394
Yeah...

86
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,730
I suppose so.

87
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,500
So, what brought
you here today?

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,690
Wellâ¦

89
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,555
It's kind of hard to say
what I'm asking you to do.

90
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:51,446
Actually, I just wanted to ask
you to go back to the old you.

91
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,275
- The old me?
- Yes.

92
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,095
A yakuza.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,882
Old man, don't joke
around with me.

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,907
I wouldn't joke about
asking you to do this.

95
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
Please...

96
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,503
I really need your help!

97
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,494
What's the story?

98
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,525
You want me to be a G-man.

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,511
You're no stranger
to Tatsumura.

100
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,183
I would like to ask you to do this.

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,250
And let me assure you,

102
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:35,157
this isn't about saving the
face of the police or anything.

103
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,079
We have to crush that germ-like
organization as soon as possible.

104
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,040
Old man, if you want to talk about that,
please take it up with someone else.

105
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,052
I'm asking because I know
I can count on you.

106
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,879
It's not a job that
just anybody can do.

107
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,168
Don't give me too much credit.

108
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,598
I'm not that respectable.

109
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
But--

110
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,540
First of all, I don't want to do
anything that'll open old wounds.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

112
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,343
Maybe I shouldn't have
asked you to do it.

113
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,666
Why don't you get out
of this business?

114
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,210
I'd be happy to
help you find a job.

115
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,275
It would be my pleasure.

116
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,470
But I'm a man with no education at all

117
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,907
living only for this job
since I was a simple police officer.

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,627
The grime sticks and
doesn't seem to come off.

119
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,926
I might have to die to get it clean.

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,988
I'm sorry I can't help you.

121
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,875
It's okay.

122
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,653
I'll definitely
attend your wedding.

123
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:28,653
Yeah.

124
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
Bye.

125
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,025
Oh? Is Mr. Ogata
going home already?

126
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,980
- Yes.
- Oh.

127
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,010
What was that about?

128
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,525
It has nothing to do with us.

129
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:48,030
Yes, this is Tojima
Transport Co.

130
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,290
Huh?

131
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,170
What's up?

132
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:53,635
It's the usualâ¦

133
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,559
- Hello.
- How's it going?

134
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,973
Are you ready to
accept our protection?

135
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,700
I refuse. I don't want
to be under your care.

136
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,258
Think carefully about it.

137
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,731
Without a driver there wouldn't
be any business, you know.

138
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,770
What?

139
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,250
What did he say this time?

140
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,587
Don't worry about it.

141
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,847
Huh? The car's back.

142
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,188
Oof!

143
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:38,571
Brother!

144
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,133
- Osamu!
- Osamu!

145
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,930
What's wrong?

146
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,199
He said he got
jumped by thugs.

147
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:44,242
- Thugs?
- Yeah.

148
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,810
- Let's go inside to treat the wound.
- Yes.

149
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,655
So when did you get out?

150
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:52,677
Today.

151
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,798
I was on my way here.

152
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,850
I was surprised to see that the
truck was marked "Tojima Transport"!

153
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,278
Boss, I'm quitting.

154
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,855
No matter how many lives
I have, it won't be enough.

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
What are you saying?

156
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,729
The two guys taking a break must
have gone through the same thing I did.

157
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,570
You can't tell us
to fight the yakuza.

158
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,151
Let's do it, bro!
I can help you!

159
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,560
To be honest, I'm disappointed
that you quit the business.

160
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Osamu...

161
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,083
What have you learned
from four years in juvie?

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm not going to fight.

163
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,950
I'm going now because they're
probably waiting for me.

164
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:29,915
You're free to quit.

165
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:31,433
You can take your
salary up to today.

166
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,034
Bro!

167
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:35,213
Bro!

168
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,123
I'm disappointed in you, bro.

169
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
Where's the brother
that I used to know?

170
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,286
I'm sure he wouldn't just sit back
and let this happen to him!

171
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,700
Idiot! Damn it!

172
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,547
You're not my brother!

173
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:49,752
Osamu!

174
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:52,758
Don't talk to your
brother like that.

175
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,614
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,257
But, you know, don't you
think it's frustrating?

177
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,596
When you're
provoked like that--

178
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:05,476
It's frustrating, but we'll be out of
business if we take on every fight.

179
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,850
We're not selling fights.

180
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,770
But you were the boss's daughter.
You should understand how I feel.

181
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,330
I've forgotten, you know, the old days.

182
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,490
Both your brother and I.

183
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,060
Suit yourself.

184
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,963
No wonder my brother
became a coward.

185
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,550
His wife's too beautiful
and too decent.

186
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:23,677
Sassy little thing,
aren't you?

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,150
You should look before
you say something weird.

188
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:32,601
TOJIMA BROTHERS

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
You see?

190
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,240
This business belongs
to you and your brother.

191
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Damn it.

192
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
My brother, heâ¦

193
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:44,550
Your brother was really looking
forward to you getting out.

194
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:46,273
You have to understand.

195
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,982
We're half-brothers.

196
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,246
We're not meant to be like
other brothers in the world.

197
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,326
What are you talking about?

198
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,090
I'll throw you a welcome
home party tonight.

199
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,930
What's your favorite thing?

200
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
What do you want to eat?

201
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,091
Osamu? Osamu!
Where are you going?

202
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,350
Who was it?

203
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,690
Who was it?

204
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Who did this?

205
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,501
- Mr. Jo.
- Boss!

206
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,510
- This is my car.
- What?

207
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,767
I parked it on the corner
over there, and it'sâ¦

208
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,069
That's right.

209
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,370
Why is this happening again?

210
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,520
Shall I take care of this?

211
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,533
Mind your own business.
Leave me alone.

212
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,050
Don't say that.

213
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,126
You need our protection in case
things like this happen. Right?

214
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,767
- That means you guys are--
- Boss!

215
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,550
Anyway, let's go in.

216
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,053
I seeâ¦They've even come to
your business for protection money?

217
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:04,139
If they know the old you, they wouldn't
be able to do something stupid like that.

218
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,470
Well, go ahead.

219
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,496
Sorry. Because of my mess,
even your store is--

220
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:15,080
No, actually, my business
is being blackmailed, too.

221
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,730
You too, Jo?

222
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,030
Yeah.

223
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,930
In the beginning
they called me to invite me.

224
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,970
When I refused, the thugs came.

225
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,329
I told 'em to look people in the eye
when talking and threw 'em out.

226
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,662
And here we are today.

227
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,482
You didn't report it
to the police, did you?

228
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,050
Yeah, I thought about that.

229
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:38,233
But if the cops are there all
day long, no customers will come.

230
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,000
They predicted
that much, all right.

231
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,086
Do you know which group
the thugs belonged to?

232
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,250
They belong to the Takeda
family down the street.

233
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,357
I think Sanritsu Industries is the
mastermind behind the protection racket.

234
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,575
I heard that the
Takeda family's boss

235
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:58,180
became a shareholder of
Sanritsu Industries the other day.

236
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,533
I think that's fishy.

237
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I didn't know that.

238
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,557
A champion, huh?

239
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,940
Well, I'm past my prime if
I'm remembering the old days.

240
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
Welcome back!

241
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,630
Oh...

242
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,489
- What happened to your car?
- Uhâ¦

243
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,320
What happened to the drivers?

244
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,310
Wellâ¦

245
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
Did they all quit?

246
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Yes.

247
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,480
But that's okay.
Hire someone new again.

248
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,070
Maybe I should learn to drive.

249
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,600
What about tomorrow's work?

250
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,194
I turned it down earlier.

251
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,131
I'm sure it's not a good time.

252
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,950
Come on! Tonight is Osamu's
welcome home party.

253
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,790
It's going to be
at my apartment.

254
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,530
- Osamu?
- What's wrong?

255
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,308
I showed those guys from the Takeda
family how strong I got in juvie.

256
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,738
Idiot! What would you do if
something happened to you?

257
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,458
Worry more about yourself
than you do about me!

258
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:34,578
- Osamu, what happened?
- Ouch!

259
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Captain Fujikawa was
happy that you agreed.

260
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,640
We'll help as much as we can.

261
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:51,500
But this work is informal.

262
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Yes.

263
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,840
So it's strange when I'm the
one asking you to do this, but

264
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,760
- you take good care of yourself and--
- Old man.

265
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,930
You needn't worry about that.

266
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:03,062
I'm willing to do it even
if no one asks me to do it.

267
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,591
Well, I feel better now
that you put it that way.

268
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:07,413
And what about your subordinates?

269
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,977
I want to work in my own way,

270
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,781
so I'm going to get five or six
guys who are used to fighting.

271
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,330
What I'd really like from you
is a car that starts fast.

272
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,060
I've already got it for you.

273
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:18,830
I've got a good driver too.

274
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,503
- Come with me now.
- Okay.

275
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,330
Why did we stop here?

276
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,140
Well, wait and see.
He'll appear any moment.

277
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Huh?

278
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,950
Matsushima!

279
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:09,440
Hey, you're caught red-handed.

280
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I haven't done it yet.

281
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:13,665
You should be glad you haven't.

282
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,360
If you had, you'd be back
eating stinky food in jail.

283
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Sorry.

284
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:21,215
I'll tell you what, instead, I'm
going to have a little chat with you.

285
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,603
Please, no more lectures--

286
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,867
That's not what I meant.

287
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,950
- I want to show you something.
- Huh?

288
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,858
Whoa!

289
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,890
This engine--
It's like a sports car!

290
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,969
What do you think?
Would you like to drive it?

291
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,096
Oh? You don't mind?

292
00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:37,008
- I'll leave it with you.
- Yeah!

293
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,650
Oh, it's a police motorcycle.

294
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,730
- Should we make a run for it?
- Idiot!

295
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,847
You should stop
for the poor guy.

296
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,430
Are you sure?

297
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,330
Do you know how fast
you were going just now?

298
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,310
Thank you for your work,
but there's a reason for that.

299
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
Are you on a case?

300
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,175
Yes, well, something like that.

301
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,815
Sorry about that.
Thank you for your work.

302
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,380
This is great!
Shall we try a little more?

303
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,260
I've had enough of this.
I'll turn it down this time.

304
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,167
I'll introduce you to
a guy you might like. Go!

305
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,497
You damned fool!

306
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,610
What the hell are you doing?
Fuck you, motherfucker!

307
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:36,787
Come here!

308
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,330
Get the fuck off me!

309
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,390
You son of a bitch!
You ruined a girl's life!

310
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,520
Get the fuck off me!
Get off of me!

311
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,164
- What's going on?
- Oh...

312
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,855
He tricked a runaway
girl and sold her.

313
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:47,855
Oh.

314
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,496
Well, that's the guy.

315
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,199
He's so hot-blooded that he
sometimes forgets his duties.

316
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,370
But he's a great shot.
I'll introduce you.

317
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,122
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

318
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
What are you doing?

319
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,489
- I see, he's fast--
- Drop the gun!

320
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,035
Oh, excuse me.

321
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,560
Mr. Ogata asked me
to test your skills.

322
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,180
Sorry, sorry.
This man is right.

323
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,196
Never trust a person
who has a gun.

324
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,365
By the time you get mad
at their trick, it's too late.

325
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,792
Okay. Old man,
you should explain.

326
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:25,792
- I have some other ideas.
- Okay.

327
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,350
Ron.

328
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,413
There you go.

329
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:50,764
Ron.

330
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,655
- Here, reach!
- Ron!

331
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,070
Little three dragons. Half flash.

332
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,165
You bastard!

333
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,355
You son of a bitch!

334
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,290
Bro!

335
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,311
I don't know what all this is about,
but give him a break.

336
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,570
I'm telling you--

337
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,653
Let's go. Come on.

338
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:33,170
Man! Thanks for saving me. I guess
it's different when you're a pro.

339
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,570
Don't you have any shame,
cheating a bunch of thugs?

340
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,650
Well, it's like they say,
"Poverty dulls the spirit."

341
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
What's up?

342
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,629
I need to borrow your help.

343
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
It's work, isn't it?

344
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,250
Is it a safe or is it a--

345
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:47,580
Neither. Anyway, come
to my house tonight.

346
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,820
If you want the manager,
he ain't here!

347
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,876
The owner changed today.

348
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,060
Go there to collect the debt!

349
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:03,034
Looks like things are
pretty rough for you.

350
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,174
Boss. You've come
at a good time.

351
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,206
I'm not sure I'd enjoy a
farewell party by myself.

352
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,456
What farewell party?

353
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,690
They're all gone.

354
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
How did that happen?

355
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,230
Well...

356
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,550
A series of disturbances
the other night, you know,

357
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,913
bartenders running away,
waitresses being takenâ¦

358
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,140
Even the debt was taken
over by Sanritsu Industries.

359
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,627
The former champion
is no longer in shape!

360
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,868
I'll give them all to that
bastard Tatsumura!

361
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:42,282
I'll explain later, but I want
you to come to my place tonight.

362
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,340
Hey, sis! My brother's back!

363
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,425
Honey, those people have
come to pick up the truck.

364
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Did you really sell it?

365
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,079
Yeah, we've already
made the deal.

366
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,400
Please take it!

367
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,210
Hey, why are you doing this?
What are we going to do now?

368
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,236
I'm sorry to break it to you,

369
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:04,544
but I've decided to
go back to my old life.

370
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
What?

371
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,210
You'll have to live in the
apartment for a while.

372
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,900
That's the brother I know!

373
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:13,199
Sorry, but there's a world of men that
women don't understand. Right, bro?

374
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:16,316
You go live with her.
And get a job.

375
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,763
That's stupid!

376
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,870
Please, please don't do it.

377
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,750
Did you forget what
happened four years ago?

378
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:24,174
Didn't you almost die trying
to crawl out of the muck?

379
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,120
Don't get desperate just because
things aren't working here.

380
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,500
We can go somewhere
where there are no yakuza.

381
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,393
Please, please don't do it.

382
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,294
I'm sorry, but I've
made up my mind.

383
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,590
This time I'm going
to do it my way.

384
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,215
That's right!
That's right, brother!

385
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,127
But you can't do it alone, bro.
Hey, please, let me do it.

386
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,550
I'll bring my friends
if you want.

387
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,919
Idiot!

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,360
I said no, you can't do it.

389
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:50,890
Pack your bags with her.

390
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,443
I've now given you
the gist of it.

391
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,213
I'd really like some
help from you all.

392
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,455
I just want to assure you that
we're subcontracting for the police.

393
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,970
It's low-pay despite the risk.

394
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,050
I'd like to know if you're
still willing to take it on.

395
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,370
Please don't
hesitate to tell me.

396
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,624
When you say subcontracting for
the police, how will you start?

397
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,260
First I'll pretend to make
a comeback to the yakuza.

398
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,392
Then I'll infiltrate their organization
under the guise of a turf war.

399
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,193
That would mean
we're the Tojima family.

400
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,938
Gentlemen, this is the
perfect role for you.

401
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,660
If you look in the mirror
I think you'll see what I mean.

402
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,770
I don't want to flatter you, but
I'd hardly call you all good citizens.

403
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:37,761
But it takes a hell of a lot of
guts and horsepower to hit them.

404
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,670
You're all perfect team
members in that regard.

405
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,716
Hey, bro, even though it's police work,
we're putting our lives on the line.

406
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,490
There will be a little
reward, won't there?

407
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,812
I can't guarantee that.

408
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,210
I'm sure you'll
manage it just fine.

409
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,534
But don't forget there's
a policeman next to you.

410
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,214
So let's hear your answer.

411
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,816
Can you guys give me a hand?

412
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,590
Let's show them what we can do!

413
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,095
I'll get Tatsumura back
for his protection racket.

414
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,360
How about you, Matsushima?

415
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,820
Well, I'm being asked
to take care of the car.

416
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,040
I don't see anyone
else qualified.

417
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,130
Goro?

418
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,972
I'll do my best to
save the extra money.

419
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,107
Mr. policeman?

420
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,722
It's my duty so
I'll do whatever--

421
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,339
You scared me!

422
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:29,642
- Osamu!
- Brother...

423
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:30,907
Don't treat me like a stranger!

424
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,495
Everyone, I'm his
brother, Osamu Kaji.

425
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:35,072
We're actually half-siblings.

426
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,647
How many times
have I told you?

427
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,229
I'm not gonna
make you one of us.

428
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,870
Again with that.
I wish you'd trust me.

429
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,990
But a goofball like you
would be the first to get hit.

430
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:45,975
I can't take care
of a guy like that.

431
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,770
Well, then, brother.
You mean you can't--

432
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,400
You'd be slowing me down.
Give it up.

433
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:52,131
Fine, then!
I'll do my own thing!

434
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:53,835
Osamu... Osamu!

435
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,750
He's just like you the way he won't
back out of something once he's said it.

436
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:00,657
He's a real pain in the ass.

437
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,400
So everything is
okay then, right?

438
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,203
Okay, now let's get to work.

439
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,660
First you'll go out and spread word
that I'm making a comeback.

440
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,506
TOJIMA BROTHERS

441
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:31,809
<i>âª That manâ¦ âª</i>

442
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:33,885

<i>âª That manâ¦ âª</i>

444
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,367

<i>âª That manâ¦ âª</i>

446
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>By dynamite.</i>

<i>âª Everybody, everybody

448
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,570

451
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,743
<i>âª That rhythm âª</i>

452

453
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:28,590
<i>âª Dance all you want! âª</i>

454
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:32,650
<i>âª Jam session on an
enchanting night âª</i>

455
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:42,123
<i>âª I'm drunk and I'm all alone âª</i>

456
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,110
May I sit here?

457
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,873
If you don't mind
me sitting with you.

458
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,172
Would you like to
buy me a drink?

459
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,490
In return, you tell me
whose territory this is.

460
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:06,660
You sure aren't
tight-lipped, are you?

461
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:09,558
I'll have what he's having.

462
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:14,815
I hear a retired yakuza named
Tojima is making a comeback.

463
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,055
Well.

464
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,797
I'm sure there will
be an uproar now.

465
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,455
I don't think
Tatsumura will allow it.

466
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,530
But Tojima and Tatsumura
must have been like brothers.

467
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,820
People only think that's true.

468
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,296
They don't get along
with each other very well.

469
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

470
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,500
If you want to make a living as a
yakuza, it's smarter to join Tatsumura.

471
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,894
Thanks for the advice.

472
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:38,215
If you want, I can ask
the higher-ups for you.

473
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,860
Did Tatsumura ask you
to scout for the yakuza?

474
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:42,974
Huh?

475
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,453
You'll have to ask Tatsumura

476
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:46,914
if you can hire
a guy named Tojima.

477
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Then you'reâ¦

478
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,317
Next time you see me,
call me Tojima.

479
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:40,540
RECREATION CENTER CONSTRUCTION

480
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Who are you?

481
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,253
You almost got yourself killed.

482
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,047
Do you know what's
going on here?

483
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,000
I do, but thanks anyway.

484
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
Don't get me wrong.

485
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,928
I'm here to kill you.
Don't move!

486
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:04,928
Do you recognize this face?

487
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Five years agoâ¦

488
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Five years ago?

489
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:11,600
In a turf war on the beach,
you shot a guy named Kuroki.

490
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,880
Then you're Kuroki's--

491
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm his younger brother.

492
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,300
Now that you remember,
I'm going to kill you.

493
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Wait!

494
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,740
That wasn't supposed
to be a fatal injury.

495
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,700
No respectable doctor
would've treated that wound.

496
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,730
It's no wonder it was fatal.

497
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:27,774
I made a vow then.

498
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,235
I swore I'd kill you
if I ever saw you!

499
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:36,094
Are you hurt?

500
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,365
You think you saved me?

501
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,602
That doesn't make up
for my brother!

502
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Wait a minute!

503
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,380
I get how you feel, but
I've got a job I've got to do.

504
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,990
I won't let you stop me.

505
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,660
- Boss, are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

506
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,025
The advertisement worked 100%.

507
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:00,385
I've already got
a lot of sponsors.

508
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,750
That's the guy.

509
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Him?

510
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,350
A debt is a debt.

511
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,260
I'll wait until
your job is done.

512
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,824
In exchange, I'm not leaving
your side for a while.

513
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,603
I won't let you die
until it's by my hand.

514
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,443
So you're a bodyguard. Well, okay.

515
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,953
He's an old friend of mine.
Try to get along.

516
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,950
Starting tomorrow
we're going to be busy.

517
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:39,397
SANRITSU INDUSTRIES

518
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,679
Boss, Tojima is here.

519
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,010
What do you want to do?

520
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,939
I thought they'd
be here by now.

521
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:01,251
Hey.

522
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,050
To what do we owe
this surprise?

523
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,050
It's been a while.

524
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:07,462
How's your shipping
company doing?

525
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,900
I heard you were happy together
with the previous boss's daughter.

526
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:12,962
I don't think I can make
a living as an honest man.

527
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,939
I'm going back
to the old Tojima.

528
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,150
I see. That's why you came all
the way out here to say hello.

529
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,890
Shimadzu. Let's celebrate
Tojima's comeback.

530
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,316
Book a welcome home party--

531
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,066
You already threw me
a welcome home party.

532
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,161
A fancy one with lead bullets.

533
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,790
I know it was supposed
to be a fireworks show,

534
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,838
but it was very much your style.

535
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Tojima....

536
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:40,229
You've become nastier
living as an honest man.

537
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm not as bad as you.

538
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:45,001
You took over this building
in less than four years?

539
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,383
I was hoping you'd tell me
how to make money.

540
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:50,575
That's the kind of advice one can
only get from a professional.

541
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,035
I wish you'd stop
with the innuendos.

542
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,543
Sanritsu Industries
is a legitimate company.

543
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,060
And we pay our taxes.

544
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,405
If you want, you can
go ask the tax office.

545
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,140
But I hear there's a lot of money to be
made without the tax office knowing.

546
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
What do you mean?

547
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,710
For example...
protection rackets.

548
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:10,843
That sort of work
fits these guys.

549
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:13,202
Don't move!

550
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
What's this?

551
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,470
A raccoon dog's tail?

552
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,015
I'm the one who built all this.

553
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,940
I have some allies,
but also many enemies.

554
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,436
You can never be too careful.

555
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Everyone, leave us.

556
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,883
I think it's time to
cut to the chase.

557
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,562
I'm being extorted, it seems.

558
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:46,405
No, I just need a little help.

559
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,577
It's a lot of work to make up
for four years of absence.

560
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,150
I'd like to borrow your territory
for a while, for old time's sake.

561
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,800
Sorry, I don't have anything
like that right now.

562
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,944
I have enough to eat running a
theater and a recreation center.

563
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,686
Oh yeah? That's a relief.

564
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,250
Then I'll make my own
territory without reservation.

565
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,484
That's all well and good,
but be careful.

566
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,444
They say once a boxer retires,
he never makes a comeback again.

567
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,160
Jinxes can be broken
someday, you know.

568
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,461
Well, look forward to it.

569
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,190
I see.

570
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:25,802
Tojima has shown up

571
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,970
so now Tatsumura has
more things to worry about.

572
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,600
That's why he tried to
get rid of him last night.

573
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,660
That was a screw-up,
out of character for Tatsumura.

574
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,210
I'm getting lucky.

575
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,870
It's good to live a long time.

576
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,710
You've pit the two against each
other for your own advantage?

577
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:44,176
I'm the one who originally created
Sanritsu Industries, after all.

578
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,930
I didn't want to keep it in
Tatsumura's care forever.

579
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
So...

580
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:51,905
Shall we propose the election of a new
president at the next general meeting?

581
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,040
No, I think we'll wait
and see what Tojima does.

582
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,214
- Chairman!
- Hmm?

583
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,580
Mr. Tojima has come
to say hello to you.

584
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Good thing he came now.

585
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,390
Have him come over here.

586
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,740
Mr. Chairman,
it's been a while.

587
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,176
Yeah, a while. I hear you
made a comeback the other day.

588
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,450
Yeah. I'll need
your help again.

589
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,565
Yeah, sure.

590
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,450
But now I'm
practically retired.

591
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,810
Butâ¦

592
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:29,340
I heard a rumor that you'll be returning
as president of Sanritsu once again.

593
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,873
There are too many
irresponsible rumors out there.

594
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:33,898
I agree.

595
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,700
I was even gossiping
with Tatsumura just now.

596
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:40,990
With Tatsumura? They say
you had a dispute last night.

597
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,310
That's just another
irresponsible rumor.

598
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,090
But you better be careful.

599
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,282
It's weird saying this
to your face,

600
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,188
I've always preferred you
to Tatsumura.

601
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,327
If you ever need help,
I'm always here for you.

602
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,851
Oh. I'll see you, then.

603
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:01,920
Well, I'll leave you
alone for today.

604
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,810
This is a fine house
for an old fox's nest.

605
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:10,031
And they're even planning
to expand the place.

606
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:30,483
SANRITSU INDUSTRIES

607
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,400
I see. That old man
and Tojima, huh?

608
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,813
I think we can still do
something about it now.

609
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,020
You're something yourself too.

610
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
What are you after?

611
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:45,570
The Sakura family's territory?

612
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,150
Well, if that's on the table.

613
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,410
Okay.

614
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,790
I'll grant you that.

615
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,720
In exchange, get to work.

616
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,910
Eliminate the old man.

617
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Boss.

618
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,740
He's your blood relative.

619
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,625
I don't remember having
an uncle like that.

620
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Murakami.

621
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,980
Take the Kijima brothers.

622
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Mr. Chairman.

623
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,050
These men say that they
came from Tatsumura.

624
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
What do they want?

625
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,981
Can't you handle it yourself?

626
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:26,371
No, I definitely can't.

627
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,787
What are you doing?
Stop it, you!

628
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:52,815
CHAIRMAN OF SANRITSU
INDUSTRIES MURDERED

629
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,246
Killing anyone who
gets in the way?

630
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:56,964
But this is too much!

631
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,870
This is exactly how
Tatsumura works.

632
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,266
Now their organization
is strengthened again.

633
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,000
We have to find a
new way to get inside.

634
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:16,102
Welcome. Can I
get you a drink?

635
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,360
I don't have any money.
Here, let me pay with this.

636
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,657
We're supposed to ask for cash.

637
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,400
Don't be so uptight.

638
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,930
I heard whose
restaurant this is.

639
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Welcome.

640
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,150
Eh?

641
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:38,858
Are you the one
I need to talk to?

642
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Maybe. We'll see.

643
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,130
Boy, where are you from?

644
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,206
Check the family register.
No comment.

645
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:46,593
Well?! I want a clear answer!

646
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Come this way.

647
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,670
Here.

648
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:57,722
The pistol.

649
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,100
Wait here.

650
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:03,897
MANAGER'S OFFICE

651
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,004
I have someone
we could use.

652
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
We heard your story.

653
00:37:14,987 --> 00:37:16,814
- Go home for today.
- What?

654
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,310
We have to check if the gun
has been used in a crime.

655
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:22,360
If you can't tell by holding it,
then you're an amateur.

656
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
What?

657
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,033
That gun isn't loaded.

658
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,944
You're not qualified
to be a bouncer. Move!

659
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Are you the boss?

660
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,630
If you really want to work
here, do as you're told.

661
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,502
Waving that thing around
won't get you anywhere.

662
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:43,143
Got it?

663
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,980
Got it.

664
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,160
Nice to meet you.

665
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,462
The Takeda family controls
the bar area here.

666
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:52,303
The bars and cabarets in this area
are the Yoshi family's territory.

667
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,778
Both are backed by
Sanritsu Industries, I'm sure.

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Just as I thought.

669
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,659
So what's the connection between
Tatsumura and the owners?

670
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,980
It doesn't seem to be
just protection rackets.

671
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,902
I bet they're into something
more profitable than that.

672
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:09,801
Okay. This is
their turf, anyway.

673
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:12,060
Let's provoke them one by one.

674
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,083
Tojima's taking over this bar.
Get lost, goons!

675
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,350
Motherfucker!

676
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,070
Get him!

677
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,424
What the hell, you guys?

678
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:22,183
The Tojima family's taking
over this place now.

679
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,025
If you want protection
money, we refuse!

680
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,110
What?!

681
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,747
- How did you do?
- Good.

682
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,740
Ah. Now the Takeda
family's stronghold.

683
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
Let's all go together.

684
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,142
- What's that?
- I got it from the bar earlier,

685
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:52,536
but there are some weird
symbols in the purchase column.

686
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:53,834
Let's check the
next place too.

687
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,846
Go back and tell your boss.

688
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,846
Tojima is taking over
this business for a while.

689
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,387
It'd be interesting to
find a similar ledger.

690
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,778
- Let's check around.
- Yeah.

691
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Somewhere like in here?

692
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,290
This is why amateurs
are no good.

693
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,523
Leave these things
to the professionals.

694
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,398
It's just been
high school so far.

695
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,656
Now comes the college class.

696
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:05,826
Find anything?

697
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,764
Nothing of value.

698
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,070
It's written the
same way as this.

699
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,324
What could this mean?

700
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,870
I'm sure it has something
to do with their organization.

701
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:31,294
Six people.

702
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:35,860
Just six people and they're
raiding turf all over the place.

703
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,540
And what do you want me to do?

704
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,280
I'm truly ashamed.

705
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:42,882
Actually, I'm going to
take care of this right now.

706
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:44,042
I just wanted
to let you know.

707
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:46,202
In that case,
leave him be.

708
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,352
Let him do his
thing for a while.

709
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,170
But that's--

710
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,430
Don't you get it?

711
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,360
What's a couple of
cabarets and bars?

712
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:57,491
The point is to keep our
organization unnoticed.

713
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,820
Wait and see what they uncover.

714
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,578
SANRITSU INDUSTRIES

715
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,553
- Hey.
- Huh?

716
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,260
So what are they doing?

717
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:22,570
They're not moving at all.
The car's crying.

718
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,991
We'll let it rest while it can.

719
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,190
What the hell is going on?

720
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,890
He's wearing a Sanritsu badge!

721
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Who are you calling?

722
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,940
Oh, it's you, bro!

723
00:42:58,347 --> 00:42:59,347
Don't scare me!

724
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,315
- I was just about to call you--
- Come here.

725
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,690
What the hell is going on here?

726
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,201
I used my brain a little.

727
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,880
Not many people know that
you and I are brothers, right?

728
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,790
Because we have
different last names.

729
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:18,100
So I figured it was up to me to
sneak into Tatsumura's place.

730
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,347
I told you that you can't.

731
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,144
It's too late. I'm in.

732
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,360
So you don't want
to hear what I got?

733
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,080
You got something?

734
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,590
Actually, I'm just
about to get it.

735
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,850
Idiot.

736
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,410
You've got me beat.

737
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:33,265
Well then, brother!

738
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,066
But be careful, you're
talking with the enemy.

739
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,210
If you're as careless as you
were just now, you're dead.

740
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:41,776
They're totally systematic.

741
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:42,930
In that organization,

742
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:45,465
unless you're a real old-timer,
you canât figure out anything.

743
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
It seems so.

744
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,000
I tried to step on his income
streams, but it didn't work so well.

745
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,119
I'm sure he's got some
big source of money.

746
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,858
I'll find it eventually.

747
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,030
See you later, brother.

748
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:07,703
All right, place your bets!

749
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,352
But think carefully
before betting.

750
00:44:09,377 --> 00:44:10,590
Watch closely!

751
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,190
Here we go.

752
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,810
That one.

753
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
You choose this one?

754
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,276
Are you sure this is the one?

755
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:22,561
Too bad!

756
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:24,790
I feel bad about
taking from a cop.

757
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,122
Okay, one more time!

758
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:27,638
We have a visitor.

759
00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:58,030
Hey, stop.

760
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,320
They've been going to bars
and cabarets for a while.

761
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,109
They don't seem to be
collecting laundry.

762
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,630
What are they doing?

763
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,390
Okay, I'll find out.

764
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,860
Give me a hand.

765
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,410
Hey, can I get a light?

766
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,340
Thanks.

767
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:53,660
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

768
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:56,410
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

769
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,290
Hey, what do we do?

770
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,770
What do we do?

771
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:33,432
Good! It's a red light!

772
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:47,918
You stupid bastard,
you had me worried.

773
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,371
I see.

774
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,901
So the dry cleaner
was a collector.

775
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:54,950
Yeah.

776
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,180
But where is that
money coming from?

777
00:46:58,212 --> 00:46:59,977
A bag this big with
a bunch of bills in it.

778
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,280
And instead of laundry,
there's a load of whiskey.

779
00:47:03,507 --> 00:47:05,655
A Daihatsu Midget,
whiskey, and wads of cashâ¦

780
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:07,572
What kind of mystery is this?

781
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,635
Weâll have to poke around more.

782
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,583
Come on.

783
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:21,106
Come on.

784
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,330
I went to see Mr. Ogata.

785
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,060
I was hoping to ask
Mr. Ogata to stop you.

786
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,140
And he told me the truth.

787
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,910
You should have just told me.

788
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,025
Am I such an unreliable woman?

789
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:54,327
No.

790
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,757
This is my problem.

791
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,050
I thought I'd washed my hands of the
business, but they don't respect that.

792
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:02,251
I had to do it.

793
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,587
To break free.

794
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,180
I understand.

795
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,110
But this is not just about you.

796
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,650
Good luck.

797
00:48:12,096 --> 00:48:13,998
You're doing a good
thing for the world.

798
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,140
Butâ¦

799
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:17,805
Don't overdo it.

800
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:28,204
<i>âª When I lie in bed, there's a man âª</i>

801
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:33,030
<i>âª When I drink wine, there are two men âª</i>

802
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:37,920
<i>âª When I walk down the street,
there are three men âª</i>

803
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:48,643
<i>âª They all stare at me, dead âª</i>

804
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,010
Boss, Tojima is here.

805
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,330
What?

806
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,747
Okay. I'll check it out.

807
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,520
<i>âª The people who loved me âª</i>

808
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:06,442
<i>âª They all disappear âª</i>

809
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:24,923
<i>âª Little red flowers in the heart
are hickeys made of lead bullets âª</i>

810
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
What's up?

811
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:36,307
Are you still
scouting for recruits?

812
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:37,332
Not anymore.

813
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:39,432
I found a really good warrior.

814
00:49:40,182 --> 00:49:41,586
I think you're in
the wrong place.

815
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:42,679
Is that so?

816
00:49:42,765 --> 00:49:44,742
I think I read the sign
properly and I came in.

817
00:49:44,843 --> 00:49:46,323
I think the woman
made a mistake too.

818
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,723
Aren't you just a kid?
Don't smoke.

819
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:49,919
What?

820
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,820
I've got a lead.
I'm counting on it.

821
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,157
Punch me once.

822
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:55,298
You son of a bitch!

823
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:07,551
What should we do?

824
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,964
What's he up to?

825
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:11,742
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

826
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:13,699
Wait a little longer.

827
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,636
- Check the moonshine.
- Got it.

828
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:21,449
I'll leave that to you.

829
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,173
Oh, hello! Metropolitan Police?

830
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,290
Listen, I'm at the
"Night Castle" cabaret!

831
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,477
There are drunks rampaging!

832
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:34,610
Yes! Please come!

833
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,157
- You're saved by the bell.
- It's a draw.

834
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Something extra.

835
00:50:55,064 --> 00:50:56,423
I wonder if it's
just a turf war.

836
00:50:56,994 --> 00:50:59,090
No, it can't be.

837
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,257
Moonshine.

838
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:05,604
This was the key to
their secret organization.

839
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,901
So, through the bosses of
the amusement quarters

840
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:11,834
they would get this moonshine
into bars, cabarets, and clubs,

841
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,630
then they paid profit
dividends to the shareholders.

842
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:18,567
Then this ledger is likely a
record of moonshine sales.

843
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,114
I wonder how much money
they can make on this.

844
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,464
If they put import prices
on such cheap liquor,

845
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,110
they'll make twenty
times as much.

846
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,159
- Twenty times?
- And it's not taxed.

847
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,899
Compared to that, protection
rackets are nothing.

848
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:30,924
In any case,

849
00:51:30,928 --> 00:51:33,088
we're going to find out where
the moonshine factory is.

850
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,916
Then we can have
them by the throat.

851
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:37,814
First, let's do all we can
to find the couriers.

852
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:16,731
Wait a second.

853
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,160
What's that?

854
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:25,419
They're collecting
empty bottles.

855
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:27,651
So they finally have a
job that looks like a job.

856
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:56,676
That's kind of weird.

857
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,356
- What?
- Those two cars behind us.

858
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:01,808
They've been following
us for a while now.

859
00:53:05,618 --> 00:53:06,618
Here they come!

860
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:29,530
Hey! That's one gone!

861
00:53:30,371 --> 00:53:31,411
Hey! Here they come again!

862
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:47,379
Damn it!

863
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:02,880
That was close. Good job.

864
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,510
Hey, Matsushima, what's wrong?

865
00:54:12,221 --> 00:54:14,018
Oh! Stupid son of a bitch!

866
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,680
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

867
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:19,567
This car was entrusted to me.
I can't leave it with anyone.

868
00:54:20,085 --> 00:54:21,085
You're stubborn!

869
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:23,649
What's wrong?

870
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:25,889
We got shot at while tailing
the bottle collection truck!

871
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:26,889
Call a doctor!

872
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,444
If it gets in the papers,
they're gonna find out.

873
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,007
It's no time for
talk like that!

874
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,290
Wait. Lay him down over there.

875
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:38,131
Stay sitting.

876
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:40,612
Don't just stand there.
Run hot water.

877
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,192
Will it work?

878
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,111
It didn't work out
for my brother.

879
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:02,716
Because it was close
to his vital organs.

880
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:05,272
But it's going to
be okay this time.

881
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:13,852
Come on, bite down!

882
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:15,755
Harder!

883
00:55:39,861 --> 00:55:40,861
Hey!

884
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:45,490
He only fainted.

885
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:54,566
It's done.

886
00:56:01,016 --> 00:56:02,837
So their focus is now
on the organization.

887
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,673
By the looks of it, they're
doing a lot of research.

888
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,550
Maybe he's a rat for the cops.

889
00:56:11,142 --> 00:56:12,142
No way.

890
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:14,558
No way would the
cops trust a yakuza.

891
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,010
But this needs a
thorough investigation.

892
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,860
If he's willing to go so far,

893
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:22,580
I have an idea too.

894
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,292
I came here today to talk to
you on behalf of Tatsumura.

895
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:41,768
So now you're going to join
me and take down Tatsumura?

896
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:48,040
Tatsumura wants to have
a peaceful talk with you.

897
00:56:48,602 --> 00:56:49,842
I'm gonna use
this for a moment.

898
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:01,031
Hello.

899
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:03,678
Hey, it's me. Yeah, I'm
giving him the phone now.

900
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:05,566
It's Tatsumura.

901
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:09,651
Hello.

902
00:57:09,855 --> 00:57:11,584
Tojiima? It's me.

903
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:13,948
I don't have anything to
talk to you about now.

904
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,740
You might not, but I do.

905
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,770
Say, would you like to
hear a pretty woman's voice?

906
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,860
What?

907
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:23,865
Would you like
to say something?

908
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:28,459
She doesn't seem to
have anything to say.

909
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,810
But you're not an idiot.

910
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,598
So I'm sure you'll
back off quietly.

911
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:33,947
Don't give in!

912
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:35,350
All you've done
will be for nothing!

913
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,710
Akiko!

914
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,883
Don't worry about me!

915
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,175
Don't back off for a second!

916
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
Akiko!

917
00:58:05,508 --> 00:58:06,508
Stop!

918
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:09,752
Got it now?

919
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:11,115
Back off.

920
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:14,353
Hello?!

921
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,088
Hello?! Hell--

922
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,799
Damn it!

923
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,160
Looks like we're done here.

924
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,596
Well, I'll leave you to it.

925
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:30,601
Wait, you son of a bitch!

926
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:44,515
Boss...

927
00:58:49,712 --> 00:58:51,774
SANRITSU INDUSTRIES

928
00:59:10,002 --> 00:59:11,385
I'm here to see Tatsumura.

929
00:59:11,502 --> 00:59:12,502
Stay out of this, thugs.

930
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:17,297
Mr. Tojima.
He's waiting for you.

931
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,040
Excuse me, but I'll
hold your things for you.

932
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:26,409
What's up?

933
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:27,409
Heh-heh. Wellâ¦

934
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,228
- Sis!
- Don't move!

935
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:36,676
Sorry about last night.

936
00:59:37,986 --> 00:59:40,180
I didn't mean to
make things worse.

937
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,374
I just thought our discussion might
go better with a woman involved.

938
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:45,969
Well, have a seat.

939
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:48,370
We're not supposed to sit
down and talk to each other.

940
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:51,910
I see.

941
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:55,528
Well, let's hear your
answer right away.

942
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:00,018
You'll back off,
of course, right?

943
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,010
I'm not backing off yet.

944
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,510
Oh...

945
01:00:04,843 --> 01:00:06,840
I guess we had it all wrong.

946
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,260
We thought you had
a thing for that woman.

947
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,130
So you don't care
what happens to her?

948
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,790
I'd like to ask you
something first.

949
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,270
Do you have the guts to
make a suicide pact with me?

950
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,620
A suicide pact?

951
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:22,755
Yeah.

952
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:24,600
You wouldn't have the guts.

953
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,940
Because you have
too many things.

954
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,930
You ruined my business.

955
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,110
And you even kidnapped Akiko.

956
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,440
Thanks to you, I'm really
naked. I have nothing to lose.

957
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:38,739
Not even my life.

958
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,196
If anything happens to Akiko,
you can be sure I'll kill you.

959
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,600
If you think being surrounded by
guns will stop me, you're wrong.

960
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,440
I swear I'll get it done.

961
01:00:49,268 --> 01:00:50,268
How about it?

962
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,930
Shall I try it right now?

963
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:55,591
If you don't have the guts,
return Akiko immediately.

964
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,010
Then you can fight me.

965
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,800
Are you so rotten that
you can't even do that?

966
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,880
Boss, I know who the spy is.

967
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:11,909
Who is it?

968
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,582
It's that bastard Kaji.

969
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:18,674
He didn't see me and I caught
him trying to save the girl.

970
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,530
I tied him up and threw
him in the basement.

971
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:23,746
I seeâ¦

972
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:26,260
So he was the cop's dog.

973
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:29,992
Or was he your dog?

974
01:01:35,172 --> 01:01:36,812
I guess that was a
stupid question to ask.

975
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,190
Let's ask Kaji himself.

976
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,250
Show our guest the way.

977
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,370
So you're a dirty rat and
you had me fooled, too.

978
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,190
I'd like to know
who asked you to do it.

979
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,527
I just felt sorry for the girl,
so I decided to let her go.

980
01:02:03,772 --> 01:02:05,412
I'll make you wish
that you'd talked.

981
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:12,731
- Idiot!
- Bastard!

982
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:13,828
Idiot!

983
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,788
It's useless to beat me up.

984
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:18,789
Useless, huh?

985
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:21,605
Wait.

986
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,118
That's some nerve you got.
Give me the pistol.

987
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:27,123
Tatsumura, I have a request.

988
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:29,480
You're finally
starting to understand.

989
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,030
He was trying to save my girl.
I'm responsible for that.

990
01:02:33,139 --> 01:02:34,779
If you're doing this
for me, don't bother!

991
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,912
I have no connection
whatsoever to you.

992
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:41,795
Besides, he's not someone
you can negotiate with.

993
01:02:42,018 --> 01:02:43,018
I see.

994
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,298
Sit him up.

995
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
Wait.

996
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,708
If you're worried about me,
mind your own business.

997
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:05,203
I've admired men like you
since I was a kid.

998
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,500
You've been my dream.

999
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,240
Please.

1000
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:11,873
Please don't destroy my dream.

1001
01:03:18,874 --> 01:03:19,874
Stop!

1002
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,430
Wait.

1003
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,076
Wait.

1004
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:26,915
Finally you're ready
to come clean.

1005
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,160
I don't want to die by
the hand of this beast.

1006
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:34,366
Mr. Tojima.

1007
01:03:34,999 --> 01:03:37,740
Shoot me with your hand.

1008
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:40,412
Please.

1009
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:43,822
Give me the gun!

1010
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:46,100
This is one hell of a show.

1011
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:47,924
Let me enjoy the spectacle.

1012
01:03:50,682 --> 01:03:52,886
Come on! Come on!

1013
01:04:08,129 --> 01:04:09,129
He's dead.

1014
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,520
That takes care of one of them.

1015
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:25,997
Think the next one
through carefully.

1016
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:27,648
Our guests are leaving.

1017
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:29,366
Politely see them out.

1018
01:04:34,928 --> 01:04:37,799
TOJIMA BROTHERS

1019
01:04:58,539 --> 01:04:59,539
Damn.

1020
01:05:00,382 --> 01:05:01,580
They're all over the place.

1021
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:06,420
Everyone, just hang in there.

1022
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,060
But Boss--

1023
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,700
If we back off, Osamu
won't rest in peace.

1024
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:13,608
Akiko won't be pleased either.

1025
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,080
But with such surveillance!

1026
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
There's still a way!

1027
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,110
We're disbanding today!

1028
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:21,619
What?

1029
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:23,029
The Tojima family
has disbanded?

1030
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,380
Yes, I'm sure.

1031
01:05:24,492 --> 01:05:25,533
I saw it with my own eyes.

1032
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,294
With him still around,
we can't be too careful.

1033
01:05:29,649 --> 01:05:33,110
Why don't you get rid of all
the moonshine we have on hand?

1034
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:35,383
Mmm. You'd better get prepared.

1035
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:38,450
I'll have the factory
moved to the Kansai region.

1036
01:05:58,068 --> 01:05:59,148
- Shochu with cider.
- Sure.

1037
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:06,974
Hey! How's it going?

1038
01:06:10,657 --> 01:06:11,657
What's wrong?

1039
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:13,434
- That's weird.
- What is?

1040
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,394
Look. A milk truck
at this hour?

1041
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:18,915
If it's a courier,
it should have an escort.

1042
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:23,987
That's it. I'm sure of it.

1043
01:06:23,987 --> 01:06:25,241
But how do we follow it?

1044
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,160
Got it! I'll handle it!

1045
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:37,632
Hey! What are you doing?

1046
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:39,010
I'm borrowing it for a while.

1047
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,755
Idiot! I'm a cop!

1048
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:42,435
We're gonna lose 'em
if you talk like that!

1049
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,443
I'll return it later!

1050
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:49,523
There it goes!
Are you coming or not?

1051
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:51,459
Looks like I have no choice.
I'm with you.

1052
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:02,962
They're slowing down.

1053
01:07:04,171 --> 01:07:05,411
It's to see if we're following!

1054
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:07,513
They're changing lanes.
I'm gonna pass!

1055
01:07:38,531 --> 01:07:39,750
Okay. Here we go.

1056
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,370
Let the boss know right away.

1057
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:43,249
I'll take a good look
at the surroundings.

1058
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,400
- Hello?
- Boss!

1059
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,161
- Yeah.
- We located the moonshine factory!

1060
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:50,507
What?

1061
01:07:50,507 --> 01:07:52,267
It's in the warehouse
district at the harbor!

1062
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,420
Come soon!

1063
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,070
Everyone is supposed
to meet here!

1064
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,248
Okay! I'll be right there!

1065
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:38,467
You.

1066
01:08:40,077 --> 01:08:41,921
I told you I'd never
leave your side.

1067
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:44,490
Now you owe me one.

1068
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,130
Make sure the debt
won't be irrecoverable.

1069
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:08,830
Great work.

1070
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,780
Here's a map of the
area around the factory.

1071
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,590
There are entrances and exits
at the front and the back.

1072
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,070
Okay, I got it.

1073
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,269
Let's split up and go in.

1074
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:19,802
Everybody drop your pistols!

1075
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:29,975
Tojima.

1076
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,348
I see you were the cops' dog.

1077
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,780
Who stabbed us in the back?

1078
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,180
You were too careless.

1079
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,610
I'm just trying to learn how to
organize the G-men next time.

1080
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:46,200
Look, here comes the
one you want now.

1081
01:10:54,687 --> 01:10:55,687
Goro!

1082
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,539
Next time pick someone who's
not greedy for money or women.

1083
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:02,933
So...

1084
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,231
Take our guests
to the basement.

1085
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,400
This factory is
closed because of you.

1086
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:16,118
If you're going to die, it might as
well be in a place with memories.

1087
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:18,900
In one hour this place
will be nothing but ashes.

1088
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,870
Along with all
of you, of course.

1089
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:22,972
Boss. The explosives are ready.

1090
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,180
Get ready to leave.

1091
01:11:26,718 --> 01:11:27,718
Tojima.

1092
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:30,118
I told you a comeback
was impossible.

1093
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:34,579
Never underestimate
the power of a jinx.

1094
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,950
Damn it! You son of a bitch!

1095
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:41,313
Stop pulling!

1096
01:11:41,313 --> 01:11:42,553
The debt will be irrecoverable!

1097
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:45,671
Boss.

1098
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,940
We have to do somethingâ¦

1099
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,380
You can have your traitor back!

1100
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:52,043
Damn you!

1101
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,458
Damn it!

1102
01:12:02,033 --> 01:12:03,127
They tricked me!

1103
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:07,250
Brother, I'm sorry!

1104
01:12:07,766 --> 01:12:11,573
They bribed me!
I couldn't resist!

1105
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:15,585
I'm sorry!

1106
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,442
Forgive me, everyone!

1107
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,220
Goro!

1108
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:55,965
Brother!

1109
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:05,652
Hey, everyone hurry up!

1110
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,470
Goro!

1111
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:20,096
Damn it!

1112
01:13:21,212 --> 01:13:22,420
Let me do it.

1113
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:56,805
I told you...

1114
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:59,729
I told you I'm a pro.

1115
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:04,471
Goro, hey!

1116
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:05,612
Goro!

1117
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:35,446
Shoot it open!

1118
01:14:39,157 --> 01:14:40,890
Damn it, we need weapons!

1119
01:14:40,969 --> 01:14:41,969
Here.

1120
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:45,918
- What about Tojima?
- Yes, sir!

1121
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:47,779
- Get it done quickly.
- Hey! Come on!

1122
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,709
- Where are they?
- Inside! Go!

1123
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,740
Go!

1124
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,411
Hello? Hello?!

1125
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:13,473
Damn it!

1126
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:17,625
Damn it!

1127
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,890
Motherfuckers!

1128
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,090
- Are you ready?
- I finally got two cars.

1129
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,699
Okay. Let's go!

1130
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,636
That way! Huh?

1131
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,114
- Hey! The back?
- We're surrounded.

1132
01:17:37,114 --> 01:17:38,114
Okay! Head for the gate!

1133
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:00,658
Over there!

1134
01:19:02,103 --> 01:19:03,700
Good, good. Where's Tojima?

1135
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:11,099
Go!

1136
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,050
Hey! Hold on!

1137
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,780
As I thought.

1138
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,748
The debt was irrecoverable.

1139
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:35,039
Kuroki!

1140
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:37,161
Damn!

1141
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,416
Tatsumura...

1142
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:45,187
Get up!

1143
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:48,929
Get up and move!

1144
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:05,395
Tojima!

1145
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:07,762
Tojima! You did a great job!

1146
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:09,348
- Because of you we--
- Old man...

1147
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:12,230
Three men are dead.

1148
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,691
Don't say anything now.

1149
01:21:39,463 --> 01:21:41,114
What have we accomplished?

1150
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:48,029
I feel like we've lost
more than we've gained.

1151
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,280
I don't think so.

1152
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,370
We did the right thing
for the first time.

1153
01:21:54,139 --> 01:21:56,860
Yeah. Even the dead
must be happy about that.

1154
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,660
Let's send them on their way.

1155
01:22:18,645 --> 01:22:25,546
THE END

1156
01:22:26,305 --> 01:23:26,623
