ï»¿1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,640
You know
that Naads have less patience.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,520
Who smuggled the children
out of Rudrapur?

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,040
Me.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,960
It was me.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Oh!

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Naad.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,520
This child has been brought
from the Domor village

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,040
for working in the temple.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
This is Janak's son.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
Janak is a good singer...

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
so they've already marked his body.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,360
I heard that four more children
have been selected.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,120
Will they be Domor village too?

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,240
Yes.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
But...

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
there's no symbol
on their bodies.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,840
There's a girl among them.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,480
Karal's daughter.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll take them with me.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,040
I won't let their futures go
to waste, Kirat.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,560
That's best.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's visit the all the houses.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
And you can take the kids with you.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,240
Keep them away from all this
and raise them to be musicians.

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,080
Kedar took five children with him

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
and left for Anandagarh.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,080
When everyone found out
what we had done...

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,440
I left Rudrapur for two years.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,960
After that, I came to Anandagarh
to meet Naad.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,680
By then, he was known as...

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,480
Kedar Mishra.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,280
I started working as a servant
in his house.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
And I changed my name...

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,080
to Anadi.

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,320
- Anadi.
- Yes.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
We have all the information.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,840
The descendants of Madanti's son Abdul...

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,360
are still alive.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,960
Who are they?
I'm sure you know.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,000
Decide who you'll save.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Your grandson...

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
or the descendants of Madanti?

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,160
Who are the descendants of Abdul?

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,760
Kedar Mishra's wife Mumtaz.

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
And Bahadur.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,320
We know that Bahadur
had a son and a daughter.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,280
He had sent them away
when they were babies.

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
Who are they?

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,120
The famous santoor player
Salamat Khan.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,960
And the renowned shehnai player
Noorjahan Sen.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Hey...

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
Hey!

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
No...

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
No!

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
Hey...

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,360
just because Anandi Uncle is no more
doesn't mean you won't keep in touch.

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,680
Couldn't you tell us?

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,400
But Grandpa Bahadur and Ramnidhi Uncle
had called after Grandpa's death.

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,159
Dad asked them to give you the news.

60
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,280
Didn't they tell you anything?

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,280
Ramnidhi Uncle?

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
What's going on?

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Let's go, Shruti.

64
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,279
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,040
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Shruti.

67
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,160
That means Amanat Khan
knew everything.

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,680
And he revealed it all
in his riddle.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,280
"All who possess the discs are 'udara'."

70
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,520
What?

71
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
See.

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,360
There are three octaves
in Indian classical music, right?

73
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Yes.

74
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,800
- High octave, mid octave, low octave.
- Hmm.

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,280
"Tara", "mudara", "udara".

76
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
High octave is called "tara".

77
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,960
Mid octave is "mudara".

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,040
And the low octave is called "udara".

79
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Think about it.

80
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,760
In the cursed caste system of Rudrapur...

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,880
the Domors are considered
to be the lower caste.

82
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
Now consider something else.

83
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,360
Think about those who received the discs
from amanat Khan.

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,920
Their parents belong
to the lower-caste Domor community.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,640
Oh! I get it.

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,640
That's why he wrote,
"All who possess the discs are 'udara' ".

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Now I understand

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
why there was an oblique mark
at the bottom of the rudrabina.

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Because the lower octave

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,280
is signified by an oblique mark
in musical notation.

91
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Correct.

92
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Hmm.

93
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,720
Why did he have to give the disc
to my mom?

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,840
There'd been no trouble
if he'd given it to your mom.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,640
Besides, why did he call my mom
"bibadi"?

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,960
That is the question!

97
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Let's see...

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,840
if Ramnidhi Uncle has an answer.

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over.

100
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,240
Isn't this the flute player?

101
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,560
Why did he come out
of Ramnidhi Uncle's house?

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,640
What are you afraid of, Ramnidhi Uncle?

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,560
Shruti

104
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Master has been terrified
ever since he met that man.

105
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,160
This is the third time
he's come here.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,519
Every time he speaks
in hushed tones

107
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,559
and leaves Master terrified.

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
Didn't I tell you
to never talk about this?

109
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,160
Leave my house right now!

110
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,040
I... I will if you ask me to.

111
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
But...

112
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,840
I can't see you
in this condition, Master.

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,160
Master's health is deteriorating.
He has stopped eating.

114
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
Who else do I have
other than you, Master?

115
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,080
I have no one.

116
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
No one...

117
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,040
No one.

118
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Who's that guy, Ramnidhi Uncle?

119
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
What does he want?

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,560
I've seen him in Anandagarh many times.
He's been trying to caution me.

121
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,880
What does he want to say?
What's he cautioning me against?

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Don't ask me these questions.

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,160
Ramnidhi Uncle, my...

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,520
my mom has been kidnapped.

125
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,520
The people of Rudrapur have...

126
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
Hmm.

127
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,840
I know that.

128
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
You...

129
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
You know this too?

130
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
Listen, Ramnidhi Uncle...

131
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,640
if something happens to Mom,
you too will be responsible.

132
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,360
I won't spare any of you.

133
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,560
Alap.

134
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
Who was that guy?

135
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,519
Tell me his name, Ramnidhi Uncle.

136
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,160
What does he want?

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
His name is Gopal.

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,640
I was one of the musicians
at Najafgarh's nautch parties.

139
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I met him there.

140
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
Gopal was a fan of Rohini's music.

141
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,440
He often came
to listen to her songs.

142
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,560
For years, I had no contact with him.

143
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
Suddenly...

144
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,880
he came to me a month ago.

145
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,760
And told me about our connection
to Rudrapur.

146
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,120
Did Anadi tell you all this?

147
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,360
Yes.

148
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,880
Ramnidhi...

149
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,240
We were good friends
back in Najafgarh.

150
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,360
And that's why I risked my life...

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
to give you this information.

152
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,600
How did you get to know
these secrets?

153
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,560
I work for the Rudrapur royal family.

154
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you know what a DNA test is?

155
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,680
A strand of hair or a single fingernail
can reveal your bloodline.

156
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,880
The royal family assigned me...

157
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
to collect all your DNA samples.

158
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,120
After a lot of effort I've finally managed
to collect them.

159
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,160
All of them can be traced back
to your real families in Rudrapur.

160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,640
They tried to match the samples
with the present members of those families.

161
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,480
And the DNA matched.

162
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,360
The DNA matched?

163
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
What do they want, Gopal?

164
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
I don't know, brother.

165
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,360
But let me tell you something.

166
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,200
The people of Rudrapur are dangerous.

167
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,960
Your life is at risk.

168
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Please be careful.

169
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,360
And don't step out of the house.

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,760
Keep this information to yourself.

171
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,840
Or else you'll be in more trouble.

172
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,840
Goodbye, my friend.

173
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,520
Buddhu.

174
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,360
Shut the door!

175
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't let anyone enter.

176
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,440
I called up Anadi
to verify this information.

177
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,280
But they told me...

178
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,080
that he has been murdered.

179
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,720
Then one by one, Salamat...

180
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Noorjahan...

181
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,760
And they had the same symbol
on their bodies.

182
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,080
I don't know who's next.

183
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,880
I am very scared, Alap.

184
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,840
I think they'll kill everyone.

185
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,640
You have nothing to worry about.

186
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,320
They're only targeting the descendents
of Madanti.

187
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,680
At least, that's what we think.

188
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,400
But you're not one of her descendents.

189
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,880
They'll...

190
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,760
not harm Rohini, right?

191
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,560
I will rescue Mom, Ramnidhi Uncle.

192
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,640
For that, I have to find
Raga Sanjivani.

193
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
I need your help, Ramnidhi Uncle.

194
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,120
And you're hiding in your room
like this?

195
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Is this the way to avert danger?

196
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,360
- Why don't you come with us?
- Yes.

197
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,480
You'll stay in Anandagarh.
We all are there.

198
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,040
Huh?

199
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
Are you sure?

200
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I had guessed...

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
that something like this would happen.

202
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
After Salamat's death...

203
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,080
I called up Ramnidhi.

204
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,280
That means you knew...

205
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,240
that we belong to the Domor community
of Rudrapur?

206
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, I knew.

207
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,760
Master Kedar never told me.

208
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,280
I got to know about it from Anadi
much later.

209
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,480
I'm really scared for Rohini, Alap.

210
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Alap, you shouldn't have kept it
from us.

211
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
You know what, Alap?

212
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Mom should use her contacts
to put more pressure on the police.

213
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,879
The more we fear them,
the more they'll take us for...

214
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,960
I...

215
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,480
- I told you, I can't do this.
- But...

216
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,240
I have only one way to find Mom.

217
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,560
I have to find Raga Sanjivani
at any cost.

218
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Lolit.

219
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,760
Take your daughter and go away.

220
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,840
Yes, but...

221
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
she's a stubborn girl.

222
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,040
She won't agree to leave in this situation.

223
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,160
Convince her.

224
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
I couldn't save any of my relatives.

225
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,440
Lolit Uncle.

226
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,800
I'll convince Saaz.

227
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,400
And I give you my word.

228
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,240
I'll find and punish
the murderers of Noor Aunty.

229
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
But before that...

230
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,240
I have to crack this notation.

231
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,440
Lolit Uncle.

232
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,040
I need the contacts
of all the senior musicians you know.

233
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,800
I want to talk to them
in case they can give me a hint.

234
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
Hail, Rudrabhairav.

235
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Hmm.

236
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,080
Naad is not good enough.

237
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,520
You have to finish the rest of the work.

238
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
Can you do it?

239
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, Rudrabhairav.

240
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Hmm.

241
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm really worried for Alap, Moti.

242
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't worry.

243
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,720
Gopal is keeping an eye on him.

244
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,360
He won't let anyone harm your son.
