ï»¿1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,270
Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,775
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,366
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,504
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,071
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,583
Lockup! Lockup!

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,586
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,521
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,057
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,253
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,886
Bastards.

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,796
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,126
Ja-a-a-son!

14
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,136
Ja-a-a-son!

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,542
You committed rape.

16
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,312
I don't remember.
I was stoned.

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,286
Oswald Snooper has asked
to see you.

18
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,117
No. I'm sorry.
I don't want to see him.

19
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,657
And I don't think is the time
or the place even to discuss it.

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,216
Your mother's name
is Barbara, age 43.

21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,956
Sister called Diana, age 6.

22
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,624
Address...
44 Elmsworth Crescent.

23
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,299
Officer Brent.

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,575
Yes!

26
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,040
Right!

27
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,641
Wing governors will split you
into groups,

28
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,517
so you can keep moving
along the corridor.

29
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,489
If you've not got a file...

30
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,785
Mavis!

31
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,316
We've allocated the boardroom
for A and B Wings,

32
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,454
the staff room to C and D Wings,

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,524
and E and F Wings
to the recreation room!

34
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,536
Mavis, have you got
any more files?

35
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,696
Oh, I've run out.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,671
- I'll have to xerox some more.
- I think so.

37
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,335
I have to call my solicitor.
It is an emergency.

38
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,071
I have my trial coming up!

39
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,211
Oi!

40
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,444
I know my rights,

41
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,612
and I have every right
to make a phone call!

42
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,849
I am a remand prisoner!

43
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,789
Take it up
with the wing governor.

44
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,224
Take it up with you, mate.

45
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,455
You want to take it up with me,
eh?

46
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,327
Well, come on, Jason.

47
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,500
If you want to make
a phone call,

48
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,468
you put your name down
on the list.

49
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,339
Oh.

50
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,442
Sorry.

51
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,436
Sorry.

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,573
Don't push your luck,
you bastard.

53
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,015
I just want to make
a phone call.

54
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,848
I'm all for making one wing
drug free,

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,821
but as we are short
of cell space at the moment,

56
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,255
to reshuffle the inmates

57
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,623
and also to arrange a detox unit
is...

58
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,854
Oh, I don't know.

59
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,986
Well, it won't work.

60
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,691
She wants them to be put on
the wing at their own request.

61
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,175
It could mean it'd end up
half empty.

62
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,430
"Any prisoner found
in possession of narcotics

63
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,664
or under the influence
of narcotics

64
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,797
will have an alternative
to punishment."

65
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,138
Like a skiing holiday
in Colorado?

66
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,208
Very funny.

67
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,405
"One... agree to the detox unit.
Two... lose all privileges."

68
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,847
"Ministerial requested
all phone cards to be withdrawn.

69
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,078
Eh?
She's got to be joking!

70
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,192
They'll never agree to that.
It's bloody ridiculous.

71
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,215
Oi!
Will you shut up?!

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,285
What page are you on?

73
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,690
Morning, Rose.

74
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,901
What's the problem?

75
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,426
I've run out of files.

76
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,369
- The Xerox machine's acting up.
- Morning.

77
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,463
Morning.

78
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,305
I've called the engineer.
He'll be two hours.

79
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,641
That lawyer, Mr. Turnbull,
is due at 2:00.

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,011
And Simon Lennox called twice.

81
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,014
But medical.

82
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,108
He's not been eating.
He's not sleeping.

83
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,277
Look.

84
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,480
I examined him, and he told me
he wanted a sex change,

85
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,990
which is why I referred him back
to you.

86
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,057
Morning.

87
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,459
Could I see you a moment?

88
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,790
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

89
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,330
Could you have a word
with Mavis?

90
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,866
Could you see what she wants
and fit her in between meetings?

91
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,528
Look. I just need five minutes
of her time this morning.

92
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,040
This is his brother coming now.

93
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,877
- It's Colin Watts, right?
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,747
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Look. Sorry about that.

95
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,548
You all right, Mum?
I'm sorry. I got...

96
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,081
There's his mother.

97
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,853
- Take the back. All right.
- Sister.

98
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,429
And girlfriend.

99
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,488
Ah. She looks about ready
to drop.

100
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,030
The police are here
about the escapee.

101
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,298
I've still not got it working.

102
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,964
Uh, Simon Lennox, please.

103
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,769
- Have they found him?
- What?

104
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,242
The police.
Have they picked up Kevin Watts?

105
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,869
Oh, I don't know.

106
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,923
Ms. Bullock said she needed
to talk to you about Ms. Purvis,

107
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,813
but she wouldn't say
what it was about.

108
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,112
The pianist.

109
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,847
Simon?
It's me.

110
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,321
Um...
Two minutes.

111
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,517
Welcome home.

112
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,322
Yeah.

113
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,454
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah.

114
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,829
No. I'll pick up anything
we need on the way home.

115
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,267
Yeah, yeah.
I'll cook.

116
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,231
Okay.

117
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,036
All I'm saying is if you remove
prisoners' privileges

118
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,599
on a snakes-and-ladders basis,

119
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,020
it's gonna make our lives
difficult.

120
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,740
All right.
All right.

121
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,442
The withdrawal
of all prison phone cards.

122
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,393
Anybody been listening
to the recordings lately?

123
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,852
The bastard Keith Smith
has been making threats

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,853
to a prosecution witness.

125
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,321
What about this suggestion?

126
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,349
Extra enforced exercise periods.

127
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,866
You start making some of those
old lags do a couple press-ups,

128
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,864
and they're gonna bloody riot.

129
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,595
The exercise program is directed
mostly at younger offenders.

130
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,660
Paragraph 3.

131
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,900
More confrontational therapy
programs.

132
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,000
Now, this lot costs,
and we've got cutbacks as it is.

133
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,102
That's exactly
what I was trying to say.

134
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,290
And she doesn't mention if we're
getting extra funding.

135
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,909
It all boils down
to extra hard work for us.

136
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,508
I haven't got one.

137
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,585
A file.

138
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,864
We're already doing
long hours at the same wage.

139
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,914
Everything here is aggravation
for us.

140
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,653
They've got three psychologists
working for the inmates,

141
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,354
bugger-all for us.

142
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,329
You got any extra report files?

143
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,523
Only we've only got two.

144
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,827
- Aw!
- Aw!

145
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,469
Yeah.

146
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,233
Kev? She's in hospital.

147
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,466
Is she okay?

148
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,339
She's fine.
She's all right.

149
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,378
You gonna make a video
of the birth.

150
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,437
I'm hiring a camera.
Sixty quid.

151
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,446
What?

152
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,380
Deposit you've got to put down.

153
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,918
Colin?

154
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,613
- Hello?
- Kev?

155
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,623
Kev?
You there, Kev?

156
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,353
Tell her I love her.

157
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,792
Yeah.
All right.

158
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,036
All right, all right.

159
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,143
Let's stick to what we're
supposed to be discussing.

160
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,230
What, the penalty?

161
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,950
Where in this
is what she intends doing

162
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,772
- to make our life easier?
- Right.

163
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,709
Where in all this is...
Is there more security,

164
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,112
more protection when we get
a shortage of staff, eh?

165
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,460
It's down to our good will that
this place still ticks over.

166
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,009
I agree.
I agree with Curtis.

167
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,644
Barfield is only running

168
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,632
because of our good relationship
with the inmates.

169
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,216
It's like every nick,
you start up a tough new regime.

170
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,194
No, no.
Dave, j-just hang on a second.

171
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,598
So consensus is Ms. Hewitt
wants to get tough,

172
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,330
but we'll be the ones
taking the brunt of it all.

173
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,497
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

174
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,332
Well, I'm bloody for it, mate.

175
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,933
- Oh, come on!
- Oh, come on!

176
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,841
- Come on!
- No!

177
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,471
Thanks, Mavis.

178
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,288
Kevin Watts' cellmate,
prisoner Barry Jones,

179
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,257
was released two weeks
after the escape occurred.

180
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,418
Do you have an address?

181
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,460
He did an extra two weeks
for assisting Kevin Watts,

182
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,659
but he denied
playing any part in it.

183
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,966
Now, you did interview him,
and I'm not allowed to disclose

184
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,648
any personal information
regarding the prisoner.

185
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,039
I was just wondering if there
was any further information

186
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,508
he could give us.

187
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,776
The escapee Kevin Watts'
girlfriend has gone into labor,

188
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,043
but family says Kevin
hasn't made any contact.

189
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,779
Do you think he'll turn up
at the hospital?

190
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,785
Yes.

191
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,185
According to his cellmate,

192
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,916
Kevin only wanted to get out
of Barfield

193
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,618
to be present at the birth
of his child.

194
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,216
We're waiting for him
if he shows.

195
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,237
So we'd appreciate
any further information...

196
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,093
- Excuse me.
- This afternoon.

197
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,266
Ms. Bullock.

198
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,599
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's with regard

199
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,468
to Ms. Purvis
and prisoner Wilfred Samuels.

200
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,665
Just a moment.
Ms. Purvis?

201
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,571
Pianist.

202
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,474
She's been playing the piano
for the "Mikado" rehearsals,

203
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,670
and I have reason to believe

204
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,976
that she is now visiting
a prisoner.

205
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,208
It's Wilfred Samuels.

206
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,078
Samuels.

207
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,260
I just think it should be
checked out... or he should.

208
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,445
- Morning.
- Morning.

209
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,852
All she knows is that he's
a lifer,

210
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,220
- and she became very upset...
- Is he in the files yet?

211
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,002
I'm still trying to bring up
some more copies.

212
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,552
The art department are using
the Xerox.

213
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,223
Just a minute.
Uh, thank you.

214
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,789
Mavis, can you contact
Barry Jones' probation officer?

215
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,277
He was in the same cell
as Kevin Watts.

216
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,167
But she's my responsibility.

217
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,281
If I have to find someone else
to play the piano, I will.

218
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,983
We're getting very close
to dress rehearsals.

219
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,169
I shall have a word
with Mr. Samuels on my rounds.

220
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,337
She's very naÃ¯ve,
and I'm worried.

221
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,938
Ms. Bullock,
I said I will look into it

222
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,058
and then I will get back to you.

223
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,244
Now, excuse me, please.

224
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,749
Have they done
the security checks

225
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,557
on all the members of
the amateur dramatic society?

226
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,927
I don't know.

227
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,398
I've got a bit of a problem.
Could I use your Xerox?

228
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,593
I have enough to do

229
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,034
without chasing up
every single request I make!

230
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,291
It's the grandmother's house.

231
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,162
She's housebound.
Uses a Zimmer frame.

232
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,365
This is car Oscar 010.

233
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,425
We're in position outside
85 Orpington Avenue.

234
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,502
Over.

235
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,300
Gran?
It's Colin.

236
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,846
- All right, Gran. It's just me.
- Ah.

237
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,916
Yep.

238
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,687
Ms. Hewitt?
Ms. Hewitt?

239
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,651
The, uh, area manager
just missed you.

240
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,889
He's, um,
he's a bit incapacitated.

241
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,591
So can you hang on for him?

242
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,259
He said he wanted to talk
to you about him.

243
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,802
What do you mean,
he's incapacitated?

244
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,804
He's late.

245
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,306
What happened?

246
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,318
You're not gonna
believe me, even if I told you.

247
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,401
- But...
- Shh, shh, shh.

248
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,104
- Good morning.
- Ms. Hewitt.

249
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,443
Oh, I'm so sorry about this.

250
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,484
I'll leave this in Ms. Hewitt's
office for you, Mr. Bunny, okay?

251
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,452
Ms. Hewitt, any word on me going
back on the wing yet?

252
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,079
It's under review.

253
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,265
How long will I have to wait?

254
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,985
Oh, just keep up
the good behavior.

255
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,583
I'll let you know.

256
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,993
I'm, uh, I'm very skeptical

257
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,826
about taking such a risk
with him.

258
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,992
I must at least try.

259
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,001
The cost of moving him
from one prison to another

260
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,229
is astronomical.

261
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:15,264
Twenty-eight prisons
in 18 months with police escort.

262
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,708
So, um, how did this happen?

263
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,609
Oh.
Karate.

264
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,513
I did a leg sweep, and...

265
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,244
I like to keep myself fit.

266
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,785
Well, in my job,

267
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,663
I think you should be able
to take care of yourself.

268
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,586
Mm!

269
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,591
I'll just get some coal
from cellar, okay, Gran?

270
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,717
Right, Colin.

271
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,562
Is she okay?

272
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,360
She's still in labor.

273
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,869
These are your
commissions, Mr. Samuels?

274
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,307
Yes, Ms. Hewitt.

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,539
Inmates give me a photo.
I paint the portraits.

276
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,513
Christmas, birthdays...
You know.

277
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,947
Mm-hmm.

278
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,743
You're working with Ms. Bullock
on the musical?

279
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,650
Yes, miss.

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,212
I don't sing, so I'm doing props

281
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,019
and helping out
on stage management,

282
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,219
painting the scenery and...

283
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,659
Helping Ms. Purvis.

284
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,895
Uh, I turn the sheet music.

285
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,399
Sometimes she has to play fast.

286
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,231
Can't turn the sheets, you see.

287
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,498
Ms. Purvis has also been
to visit you twice.

288
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,599
Yes.

289
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,701
And you've written to her.

290
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,370
Yes, Ms. Hewitt.

291
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,309
Mm.

292
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,616
Does she know
why you're in Barfield?

293
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,616
No, Ms. Hewitt.

294
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,313
She just knows I've been in
for a long time.

295
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,989
Eighteen years.

296
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,783
Is she aware that it is unlikely
that you'll be up for parole

297
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,057
for some considerable time?

298
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,795
We haven't discussed it.

299
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,136
You haven't had a visit prior
to Ms. Purvis for four years.

300
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,208
That is correct.
And I appreciate her kindness.

301
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,340
She's a very nice, respectable,
trusting lady.

302
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,010
Make sure, Wilfred,
that you do not abuse her trust

303
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,056
or abuse the trust
that we have in you

304
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,388
in allowing you to be
in the musical.

305
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,983
I won't.

306
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,519
I appreciate her kindness
very much.

307
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,958
Good.

308
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,092
Thank you, Mr. Samuels.

309
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,070
- Thank you.
- Governor.

310
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,903
I mean...
what am I supposed to do?

311
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,472
I go into exercise,
and he's starting on at me.

312
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,849
I go into the showers,
and he's goading me.

313
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,320
He's trying to make me lose
my rag.

314
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,854
And I am telling you
that unless he's moved,

315
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,191
I'm going to have to take him.

316
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,258
I can't keep turning away.
Understand me?

317
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,828
I can't not face him,
because I am losing face.

318
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,066
Understand what I'm saying
to you?

319
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,700
It's making me all tensed up.

320
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,641
I can't sleep
for thinking about it

321
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,944
because he won't leave me alone.

322
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,382
People are always getting at me.

323
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,684
I'm not doing anything.

324
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,585
But, Bert, you know
that it's to do with you.

325
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,458
You become aggressive
very easily

326
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,054
and over the smallest thing.

327
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,690
Now, you're telling me

328
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,235
that this most recent
altercation started...

329
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:34,366
Brian Samora took my chair
in the television lounge.

330
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,875
I always sit in that chair.

331
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,639
He knew it was my chair!

332
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,237
No, Bert, you don't.

333
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,011
You've only just moved
onto the wing.

334
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,643
So perhaps you took
Brian Samora's chair.

335
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,153
Morning.

336
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:49,684
Morning.

337
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,247
Morning.
Carlos, how's the new baby?

338
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,622
Beautiful, Ms. Hewitt.
Thank you.

339
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,058
Good.

340
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,323
Morning, Eugene.
How's the musical going?

341
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,240
Uh, could do with a bit more
rehearsal, Ms. Hewitt,

342
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,926
but it's all right.

343
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,968
I hear you've asked
to be back in the show, Brian.

344
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,731
Yeah. I wondered if I could get
me old part back now I'm back.

345
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,534
I don't think
that'll be possible, Brian.

346
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,540
But now that you are back...

347
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,601
Not that I think it's anything
to be quite so cheerful about...

348
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,589
I hope you'll continue
with your education program.

349
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,206
Oh, yeah.
I will, Ms. Hewitt.

350
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,561
Thank you very much, Ms. Hewitt.

351
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,083
Mean cow.

352
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,313
I heard that, Mr. Samora.

353
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,344
Ms. Hewitt.

354
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,414
Mr. Haddock, I hear you've got
a big leading role.

355
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,290
I was supposed to be playing
Nanki-Poo, but...

356
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm looking forward
to the performance.

357
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,361
They're making me play a girl,

358
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,830
and I learned all the lines
for Nanki-Poo.

359
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,897
Ja-a-a-son!

360
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,873
Ja-a-a-son!

361
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,309
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

362
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,941
I am saying
that I am being got at.

363
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,386
Bert, will you do something
for me?

364
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,349
Tonight, when you're watching
television...

365
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:03,556
If that prick sits in my chair,
I'll do something about it!

366
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,359
Just a minute.

367
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,924
I am telling you
that I'll wrap it over his head,

368
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,061
then I'll put my foot
through the TV!

369
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,697
People are always getting at me.

370
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,211
Come on, Bert.

371
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,473
I've seen Mr. Samuels,

372
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,777
and to be honest,
there is little that I can do.

373
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,444
If Ms. Purvis wishes to visit
him, then I can't really refuse

374
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,249
because I have no grounds
to do so.

375
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,448
I need me medication.

376
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,615
How is he coming along?

377
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,851
He's not.

378
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,086
He's suffering
from deep paranoia.

379
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,062
I don't think he's stable enough
to be on an ordinary wing.

380
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,995
Make sure
the wing governor knows

381
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,057
and we'll see
where we can move him.

382
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,964
Ja-a-a-son!

383
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,869
- Shut it!
- Ooh. Ooh.

384
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,965
- Shut up!
- Jason!

385
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,312
Jason!

386
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,507
Are your pants dry yet?

387
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,642
Officer Hully?
A moment.

388
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,321
Ja-a-a-son!

389
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,223
Ja-a-a-son!
Are your pants dry yet?

390
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,454
Could you excuse us a second?
Thank you.

391
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,724
Are you settling in all right?

392
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,765
Only I noticed...

393
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,630
It's Keith Smith, Ms. Hewitt.

394
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,432
Ever since I got here, he's
done it, and it drives me nuts.

395
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,269
I know I'm supposed to
ignore it.

396
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,639
Try not to let it get to you.

397
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,438
Thank you.

398
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,002
Ja-a-a-son!

399
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,674
Ja-a-a-son!

400
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,082
Ja-a-a-son!

401
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,642
Hey, Eugene.

402
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,087
Do you reckon it's sort of,
like, psychological,

403
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,489
you know, sort of like sublime,
me getting banged up again?

404
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,788
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

405
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,489
You mean you're a pillock.

406
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,964
I want you to do something
for me.

407
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,945
- I'll pay you in smokes, yeah?
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

408
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,904
Hang on.
Wait a minute.

409
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,234
What do you want us to do?

410
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,239
That prick Keith Smith.

411
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,118
He's been having a real go at me
since I came here.

412
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,203
I'd just like him given
a bit of a thrashing.

413
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,610
- Beat him up, yeah?
- Yeah.

414
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,172
I mean, not too much.
I don't want him hospitalized.

415
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,912
Just... Well, I don't have to
spell it out, do I?

416
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,454
I don't know, you know?
Keith Smith?

417
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,183
He's down on the I's.

418
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,656
We're stuck up here.

419
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,192
How are we supposed to get
to him?

420
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,854
I'll leave his cell unlocked,
maybe just after association.

421
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,193
Yeah. Come on.
That's got to work.

422
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,358
Well, Keith Smith,
he's a Cockney.

423
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,267
Got loads of mates down here.
You know what I mean?

424
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,336
I've got an idea.
Yeah.

425
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,998
We go in there,
give him a few whacks,

426
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,200
he's gonna know we did it.

427
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,800
Yeah. He wouldn't know who
done him if we had a mask on.

428
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,606
- Can you get any balaclavas?
- Yeah.

429
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,348
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks.

430
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,218
Everything's on the level.
Come on.

431
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,219
If he's on the level,

432
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,831
we'll get more than a few smokes
out of this.

433
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,687
We're not doing anything.
Don't be crazy.

434
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,248
That's what he's just asked us
to do.

435
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,452
You're a shithouse.

436
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,471
You've been saying you're
gonna do Smith in for ages.

437
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,259
- Hey! Yeah. Yeah.
- You have! You have!

438
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,698
That's between cons,
not some screw paying us.

439
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,496
Yeah.

440
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,197
It's a liberty man,
a bloody liberty.

441
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,761
Well, you can't trust a screw.

442
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,000
I hate screws.

443
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,541
That's all right.
That's normal.

444
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,440
This bastard's bent.

445
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,480
A bent screw, Bri.

446
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,174
Yes!

447
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,550
I just can't believe
that you'd go behind my back.

448
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,216
I'm responsible for you,
for your being at Barfield.

449
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,223
I just didn't think

450
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,192
it was necessarily anything
to do with you.

451
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,922
Well, how can you say that?

452
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,722
You know what happened to me.
You <i>saw</i> what happened to me.

453
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,333
And then I discover

454
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,802
that you're visiting one of
the prisoners, writing to him,

455
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,714
and without any prior knowledge
of his background.

456
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,036
I'm sorry.

457
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,940
But I just didn't think it would
concern anyone but myself

458
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,009
and Mr. Samuels.

459
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,602
Well, it does.

460
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,410
Months of hard work
have gone into this show.

461
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,040
Well, he is a trustee.

462
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,880
And it's hardly unsupervised.

463
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,386
We have officers with us
at all times.

464
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,288
Ms. Purvis, you have
no knowledge of prisons.

465
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,553
You've never been inside one
before this.

466
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,788
You are not, to my mind,
able to make any judgment

467
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,592
about whether a man
is trustworthy or not.

468
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,065
Well, he's got no family
and had no visits.

469
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,226
But he didn't mention

470
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,395
that he's serving 18 years
for armed robbery

471
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,838
and a further sentence for
the murder of a police officer.

472
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,468
Please remember, Ms. Purvis,

473
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,107
you are here to play the piano
and nothing more.

474
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,051
If there are to be no changes
whatsoever,

475
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,250
then what you are saying is that
Barfield is currently running

476
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,021
without any problems whatsoever,

477
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,585
when it is patently obvious

478
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,528
that we are just filling in
the cracks.

479
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,431
Maybe if you'd implemented
more staff,

480
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,059
more officers
to start your program,

481
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,433
then there'd be some leeway.

482
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,081
It isn't a question
of more staff, Mr. Syons.

483
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,075
- Facts are facts, Helen.
- Just a minute. Excuse me.

484
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,634
George Falla's legal beaver,
Turnbull, is in your office.

485
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,270
Okay.
Thank you.

486
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,644
Facts are facts.

487
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,807
We've got a full house,

488
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,044
but we have not got a full quota
of officers.

489
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:56,681
I am not advocating that we
begin overnight, but gradually.

490
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,447
All right.

491
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:06,158
What if we tried in practice
one wing only?

492
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,437
All right.
Why not?

493
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,771
Good.
C Wing it is.

494
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,106
Thank you, Len.
Excuse me.

495
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,720
You walked right into that one!

496
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,733
Well, you're gonna need
a bit of extra help anyway,

497
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,248
with Tarzan's moving in.

498
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,623
What, on my wing?

499
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,128
Bet you a fiver
he doesn't last the day.

500
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,824
Fifty! I can handle Tarzan.

501
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,799
Come on, boys.
Fifty!

502
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,273
I've seen my client, Mr. Falla.

503
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,837
Is he in good health?

504
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,349
I most certainly hope so,

505
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,060
since he's been coddled
the past three weeks.

506
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,054
I would like to set a date
for the police to interview him,

507
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,489
obviously with yourself
and S.O. Russell Morgan present.

508
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,357
Monday is suitable for me.
Morning or afternoon.

509
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,295
Mavis?

510
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,395
Mavis, have you got my diary
for next Monday?

511
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,400
Mr. Turnbull
would like to set up the inquiry

512
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,231
into the hostage situation.

513
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,828
I'll need at least two hours.

514
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,384
It'll have to be the afternoon.

515
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,305
You're booked up all morning.

516
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,306
Monday afternoon it is, then.

517
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,940
How is Mr. Morgan?

518
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,244
Neither as fit or as able
as your client.

519
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,376
He's still on sick leave.

520
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,847
Is there anything else?

521
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,482
I don't think so.

522
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,494
Unless... Are you free
for dinner one evening?

523
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,354
What?

524
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,358
I'm asking you out to dinner,
Ms. Hewitt.

525
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,637
I'm sorry.
I'm not available.

526
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,082
- I didn't say when.
- It's immaterial.

527
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,584
I am not available.

528
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:56,906
Excuse me.

529
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,669
Thank you for your time.

530
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,213
Yes?

531
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,443
I have Officer Jackson
and Brian Samora here.

532
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,882
They need to see you
immediately.

533
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,614
- Are they waiting?
- Yeah. Can I send them in?

534
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,451
Yes. Yes, you can, Mavis.
Right now.

535
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,788
Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Samora.

536
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,627
Go on, Brian. Tell Ms. Hewitt
what you told me.

537
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,658
Go on, Brian.
Tell her.

538
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,863
You've got a bent officer,
Ms. Hewitt,

539
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,304
and he's bringing in balaclavas.

540
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,310
Ms. Bullock,
they've done something funny

541
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,405
with these socks.

542
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,882
They're supposed to be
like that.

543
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,816
Just put them on
so you can try them out.

544
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,820
Well, they've only got one toe!

545
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,527
I think I'd better not
come see you again.

546
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,682
I'm sorry.
Oh.

547
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,489
That's all right, Ms. Purvis.
I understand.

548
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,293
No hard feelings.

549
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,026
But can I give you this?
They're just some poems I wrote.

550
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,193
Better not take them,
Mr. Samuels.

551
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,897
I'll leave them here for you.

552
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,331
Come on, Eugene.
I want to get started.

553
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,877
You try dancing in these shoes,
mate.

554
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,943
You have a bent officer...
Jason Hully.

555
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,647
Hully?

556
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,083
But he's a good steady lad.

557
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,090
Not quite so good.

558
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,219
He has apparently asked
Brian Samora and Eugene Buffy

559
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,389
to beat up another prisoner,
Keith Smith.

560
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,366
I-I wouldn't trust
those two little bastards.

561
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,911
And I should have been told
about this

562
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,699
before Mr. Jackson came to you.

563
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,703
Maybe.

564
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,970
But we will at least have to
listen to what they have to say.

565
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,872
Just front it out with him.

566
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,107
He'll deny it, won't he?

567
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,074
So what I want is to wait

568
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,245
until Buffy is back on the wing
from rehearsals

569
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,050
and we can get them both
to see me.

570
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:53,650
In the meantime,
I want this kept quiet.

571
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,389
Do not inform Officer Hully.

572
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,206
Have they picked up Kevin Watts,
our tattooed wonder?

573
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,331
No, but the police think

574
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,239
he might try and see
his girlfriend.

575
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,641
She went into labor
this morning.

576
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,939
Good afternoon.

577
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,621
âª Three little maids from school
are we âª

578

âª Three little maids

Aah! Shit.

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,006
You need to keep to small steps,
Roddy.

588
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,071
I'm trying, Ms. Bullock,
but I keep falling over.

589
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,413
Well, Roddy,
practice makes perfect.

590
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,576
Start again, Ms. Purvis.

591
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,812
Me wig's too tight.

592
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,081
Stop crying.

593
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,953
Will you not please meddle
with the props and costumes?

594
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,267
Could you check that skip,
please?

595
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,227
Right. Come on. From the top.
Come on. Come on, then.

Come on. From the top.
Ms. Purvis.

All right.
Push right through.

That's it. Keep pushing.
Come on.

Okay.

Push. Go.

What did you go
and tell the governor for?

620

You told me to report it!

Yeah!
<i>I 'm</i> gonna report it!

I've already reported it,
you bastard!

623
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,660
Stand up!

624
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,026
Governor Syons wants to see you.

625
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,999
I'm not setting foot
outside this cell.

626
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,933
Now, tell Governor Syons
if he wants a word,

627
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,028
he can have a word in here!

628
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,938
What we've got is explosive!

629
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:27,276
You should be looking after us,
not encouraging us to violence!

630
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,282
And, you see,
you... you are a tosser.

631
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,818
I saw her go towards the skips,

632
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,295
so naturally,
I went to give her a hand.

633
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,083
And she just flipped.

634
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,851
Duffy refuses to come out
of his cell, Gov.

635
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,449
I will wring his bloody neck.

636
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,994
What's all this
about Ms. Bullock?

637
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,289
What really happened?

638
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,490
It was some kind of breakdown,
I think.

639
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,466
But nobody touched her,
and I mean nobody.

640
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,804
You just bottled it up, Annette.

641
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,272
And then by refusing to...

642
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,831
Face it?

643
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,810
Please.

644
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,506
Annette, listen to me.

645
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,208
There's this colleague
of mine...

646
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,910
Nothing to do with
the prison service.

647
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,508
A psychologist?

648
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,251
What the hell do you think <i>I</i> am?

649
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,419
I don't need therapy.

650
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,393
And if I do,
I'm perfectly capable

651
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,622
of dishing it out for myself.

652
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,067
Annette, look.
I'm sorry about this.

653
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,365
But as head of this department,

654
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,668
I'm suggesting that you take
at least two weeks' sick leave.

655
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,867
No.
I won't.

656
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,076
Well, then I'm afraid
you leave me no alternative

657
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,877
but to order you off duty.

658
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,295
I counseled rape victims
for two years.

659
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,364
I thought I knew
exactly what they were feeling.

660
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:04,568
I advised... cajoled...

661
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,714
and encouraged them
to talk about it.

662
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:17,686
So like a good counselor, every
night I've gone through it.

663
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,495
I wake up every morning
thinking about it.

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,266
I know it's not
the physical humiliation,

665
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,328
the brutality...

666
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,500
loss of control, even,
that eats into you.

667
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,045
Do you know what it is?

668
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,816
It's the fear.

669
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,319
I'm frightened.

670
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,294
And I can't make it go away.

671
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,237
Annette?

672
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,079
Um, it's all right.
It's all right.

673
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,675
- Uh, could you leave, please?
- No!

674
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,481
Shh, shh, shh.
Annette, it's all right.

675
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,021
Annette, it's Helen.

676
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,920
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh.

677
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,789
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

678
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,259
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all right.

679
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,026
Come on.
It's all right.

680
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,620
Helen?

681
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,129
Simon?

682
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,435
Oh.

683
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,097
Oh, I missed you.

684
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,640
Missed you.

685
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,682
I wanted to be all dressed
for you.

686
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,241
You are distinctly overdressed
for what I have in mind.

687
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,877
Really?

688
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,890
Ooh!

689
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,128
Do you know...

690
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,097
that you have the governor of
Barfield Prison on top of you?

691
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,793
I do.

692
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,599
You have told me of that fact
at least nine times.

693
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,696
I got it!

694
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,404
I am... the governor...

695
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,942
at Barfield Prison.

696
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,680
He's eight pounds
and five ounces.

697
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,813
Can you see, Kev?

698
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,793
He's got all his fingers
and all his toes.

699
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,861
He's beautiful.

700
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,868
He's perfect.

701
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,235
He's just perfect.

702
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,897
I can't replay it again, Kev.

703
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,600
- Yes, you are.
- I've got to go.

704
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,903
They're right outside, man.

705
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,911
And I've got to talk to her,
Colin.

706
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,071
I have to talk to her.

707
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,241
I can't stand to see her crying.

708
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,080
Just be careful, all right?

709
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,881
Cops are in hospital.

710
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,184
They're outside it.
She's being watched, man.

711
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,852
Colin?

712
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,088
Colin, what are you doing
down there?

713
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,823
- Anna?
- It's me.

714
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,058
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.

715
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,465
Hey.
Just finishing with coal, Gran.

716
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,901
Then I'll help you upstairs
to bed, all right?

717
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,699
He's beautiful.

718
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,465
I love you.

719
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,803
I miss you, Kev.

720
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,207
- I love you.
- I love you.

721
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,869
Oh, come on, Kev.
I've got to go.

722
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,470
- Anna?
- I love you.

723
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,639
Hello?

724
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,841
Anna, are you still there?

725
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,443
Anna, I'll...
I'll come and see you.

726
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,953
I will.

727
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,213
Anna, I love you.

728
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,123
I've got to see me son.

729
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,795
The case dragged on
longer than anyone anticipated,

730
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:26,396
but I could be made
a junior partner.

731
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,235
Oh, brilliant.

732
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,740
Thank you.

733
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,309
You hungry?

734
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,710
Mm.
Starving.

735
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,042
Okay.

736
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,275
- Have a drink.
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,908
- Have a shower.
- Mm-hmm.

738
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,953
- Give me 20 minutes.
- Mm.

739
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,414
And wrap your intellect
around this.

740
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,588
I need to talk to you about it.
Please.

741
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,889
Deal?

742
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,452
Sure.

743
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,930
What's in it?

744
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,365
Details about a prisoner
and a hostage in Barfield.

745
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,731
But apparently, right,
when they arrested him,

746
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,967
they put him in the back
of the patrol car.

747
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,533
Officer gets out
to say something, next minute,

748
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,610
Watts has bolted from
the back seat into the front.

749
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,842
You're kidding?
The bugger nicked a patrol car?

750
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,884
Yeah.
One of the specials.

751
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,078
Had a ruddy arsenal in the boot.

752
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,280
So anyway, he drives around
for about three hours,

753
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,823
clocks up
Christ knows how much mileage,

754
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,588
all hell breaks loose,
and then he dumps it...

755
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,459
Back at a police station.

756
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,631
I wondered why the gov had gone
out of his way on it.

757
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,896
Too damn right, mate.

758
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,494
It was his patrol car.

759
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,908
Is that what he's banged up for,
then?

760
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,875
Oh. No way.
No.

761
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,071
No, he pulled a few blags.

762
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:43,309
He is a nasty little bastard.

763
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,842
The suspect's brother,
Colin Watts, is just leaving.

764
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,517
Car Oscar 010.
Suspect's brother just left.

765
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,319
We tail or stay put? Over.

766
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,756
Wait.

767
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,420
Light's on, top bedroom.

768
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,994
Now the hall light's on.

769
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,232
See?
Another light.

770
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,669
For someone on a Zimmer frame,

771
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:09,799
the old lady's moving around
pretty fast.

772
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,705
Look.

773
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,877
Now they're off again.

774
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,281
I'm going to have a look.
Stay in the car.

775
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,647
Can you open the door, love?

776
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:26,724
It's the police.

777
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,655
Can you open the door?

778
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,372
Aah!

779
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,570
Aah!

780
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,136
Can you open the door?

781
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,006
Come down, love.

782
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,573
She's deaf,
and she's bad on her feet.

783
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,778
What's going on?

784
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,411
There was someone
out in the alley.

785
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,327
Do you want me to get a key
for the front door?

786
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,823
He might be out back!

787
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,807
All I need
is some professional advice.

788
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,853
And I just can't believe...

789
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,218
- Simon.
- Mm. What?

790
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,223
Can you just wait
till the movie ends?

791
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,055
She had a gun?

792
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,651
I've seen it.

793
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,288
He killed her,
she has a dual personality,

794
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,095
and her sister is also Liz
as well as Jill.

795
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,499
You're making this up.

796
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,230
I know,
but it's better than this crap.

797
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,034
It was the cop that did it.

798
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,379
Oh. I should have accepted
Turnbull's invitation.

799
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,914
He asked me out to dinner,
you know.

800
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,414
Oh, he did, did he?

801
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,541
Mm-hmm.

802
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,608
I said no, thank you.

803
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,177
He said he hadn't said
which night.

804
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,416
And I said, well...

805
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,018
that I was still unavailable.

806
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,790
Oh. All right.
You asked for this.

807
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,196
Ooh.

808
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,064
- And that's not going to work.
- I'm gonna be sick.

809
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,577
Anything come in yet?

810
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,277
No, sir, but we've circulated
the car reg number.

811
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,411
It was parked
up at the top of the road.

812
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,752
Incompetent bastards.

813
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,586
We used clamp stitches,
as it was quite deep.

814
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,339
And the doctor's writing out
a prescription

815
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,831
for some antibiotics.

816
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,423
Thanks.

817
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,803
Is the maternity unit
close to here?

818
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,668
It's two floors up.

819
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,502
You're not pregnant as well,
are you?

820
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,836
No.

821
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,843
Right.
Well, I'll just be a second.

822
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,243
You can put your trousers
back on.

823
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,346
Right.
Let's have your tray.

824
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,833
Is it true
the musical's been canceled?

825
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,223
- Yes.
- Step back.

826
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,227
You have no right to do that!

827
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,058
You can't just cancel it!

828
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,859
Sorry, Wilfred.
It's nothing to do with us.

829
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,763
You know that.

830
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,977
Come on!
Let's have your trays!

831
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,333
You pillock!

832
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,139
Come on!
Let's have your trays!

833
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,742
Come on!
Let's have your trays!

834
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,352
You want me to call you
a doctor?

835
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,760
No. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

836
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,526
- Here.
- Thank you.

837
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,559
Mm.

838
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,159
In fact, do you know
what I think I fancy?

839
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,795
- What?
- A whiskey.

840
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,339
Whiskey?

841
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,617
Did you get some of that stuff
I like... the Wild Turkey?

842
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,768
Yes.

843
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,506
Well, why don't you get one
yourself and join me?

844
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,571
It's 8:00 in the morning.

845
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,673
It's Saturday.

846
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,352
- Hm?
- Why not?

847
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,751
I'll do this top row.

848
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,448
You collect the trays
from below.

849
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,066
A lot of aggravation
at breakfast.

850
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,217
What about?

851
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,554
Well, the musical's canceled.

852
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,026
On the board.
Gov Syons put it up.

853
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,187
What happened?

854
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,822
Nobody bloody told me.

855
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,526
- Christ.
- Trays!

856
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,466
All right.
Tray's out, lads.

857
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,265
Okay.
I'll take over this landing now.

858
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,863
Why are they canceling
the musical?

859
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,050
Don't say anything.
Here's a good lad.

860
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,599
Is it because of Ms. Bullock?

861
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,200
Don't know anything about it,
Roddy.

862
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,212
Pass out your tray, okay?

863
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,872
Jason.

864
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,644
Tray collection, Mr. Smith.

865
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,312
Here it is.
Come and get it, Jason.

866
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,218
I'm gonna have you.

867
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,916
In your dreams.

868
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,889
In your dreams!

869
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,860
What have they canceled musical
for?

870
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,696
Eugene? Brian?

871
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,395
- What have we done?
- All right, Eric.

872
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,028
Calm down.

873
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,367
Tell him not to show his face.

874
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,304
Keith Smith nicked
me phone card and all.

875
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,502
- He's... Are you sure?
- Yeah. He's nicked it.

876
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,408
All right.
I'll have a word with him.

877
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,707
Go on.

878
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,156
Jumbo, can you have a word
with Eric?

879
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,020
Another one upset
they've canceled the musical?

880
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:22,282
No. He says Keith Smith's nicked
his phone card, all right?

881
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,995
I'll make some woman
a decent husband.

882
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,802
Oh, God, Helen.
Is there a pan you missed?

883
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,604
Oh, shut up.

884
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,811
I'll be interested to see
what Turnbull tries to pull

885
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,076
if he succeeds.

886
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,276
Succeeds?

887
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,114
You mean in proving
it was Morgan's own fault

888
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,118
he was taken hostage?

889
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,814
No way.
You are joking.

890
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,880
He just might, Helen,
because I <i>wasn't</i> joking

891
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,426
when I said Turnbull
is one of the best.

892
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,007
Helen?

893
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,635
You okay?

894
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:25,047
Right.
Did you get everything you want?

895
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,311
Ta.

896
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,098
We found it parked
in a side street

897
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,436
not far from the hospital.

898
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,635
And?

899
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,473
- And?!
- The seat's covered in blood.

900
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,139
I've got someone checking
the casualty department now.

901
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,376
I want the main hospital exits
covered.

902
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,781
He's here.

903
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,013
He's either injured
or he's got a hostage,

904
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,920
so I want the armed
response team alerted.

905
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,088
It's all a bit strong, isn't it?

906
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,388
Are you kidding?

907
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,554
The little bastard nicked
the gov's patrol car.

908
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,653
This is personal.

909
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,130
Called "get the egg
off my face."

910
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,668
Bye, now.

911
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,398
Bye-bye.

912
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,633
Thank you.

913
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,677
I couldn't get away.

914
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,217
I had to wait for ages.

915
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,494
Did anyone see you leave
the ward?

916
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,214
- I don't know.
- Sit down.

917
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,620
You're mad to come here, Kevin.
There's police everywhere.

918
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,487
I know. I know!
I'll give myself up.

919
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:16,027
I just wanted to hold him.
Can I hold him?

920
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,222
I-I want to call him after you.

921
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,027
Same name as you.

922
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,667
Yeah.

923
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,403
He looks just like you.

924
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,465
Even his hands are the same.

925
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,567
Hold his hand, Kev.

926
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,578
Oh.

927
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,740
Oh, look at his little
fingernails.

928
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,718
Hello, Kevin.

929
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,049
I'm your daddy.

930
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,113
Yeah, mate.

931
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,055
I'm your daddy.

932
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,054
I love you, Anna.

933
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,024
And I love my baby boy.

934
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,624
Don't I?

935
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,193
He's all mine.

936
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,863
He looks like me, doesn't he?

937
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

938
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,198
Oh, sweetheart.

939
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,334
Bless you.

940
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,843
Are you sure that's him?

941
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,937
That's him.
I'm sure.

942
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,679
Right. We cut off the corridor
both ends.

943
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,877
But we've got to be careful.

944
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,944
Gov, lift.

945
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,580
She's going to the lifts.

946
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,284
- Let her go.
- âª The loser âª

947
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,623
Nobody's to make a move
until she's got in the lift.

948
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,613
- âª The beautiful loser âª
- Has she got the baby?

949
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,366
Stay away from me.

950
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,135
I mean it!

951
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,974
You make one more move
towards me, and I'll...

952
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,317
I'll drop it.

953
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,847
I'll drop him.

954
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,390
Nobody's going to do anything,
Kevin.

955
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:56,151
We just don't want any harm
to come to the baby.

956
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,529
Let me take the baby, Kevin,
please.

957
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,656
Oh, no.

958
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,997
I want to walk out of here.

959
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,535
I want to get into a patrol car
outside.

960
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:13,237
I do not want to be dragged out!

961
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,303
Let him walk.

962
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,439
Back off.

963
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,086
Go on, Kevin.
You keep walking.

964
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,621
Cut him off downstairs!

965
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,459
Move!

966
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,071
Come on!
Come on!

967
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,050
What's on the sixth floor.
Is that a wing or what?

968
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,669
Uh, no. It's a utility floor.
Fire escape.

969
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,042
He's on the bloody roof.

970
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,774
âª So I'm walking âª

971
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,874
âª Yes, I'm walking âª

972
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,182
âª I'll keep on walking âª

973
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,517
âª Talking my way... âª

974
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,022
Kevin!

975
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,217
We're all a long way from you,
son.

976
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,523
No one's gonna harm you.

977
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,620
Step back from the edge, Kevin.

978
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:09,132
Step back, Kevin.

979
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:20,875
- Aah!
- No!

980
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,809
You big pillock, Tully!

981
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,875
You stupid git!

982
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,353
It wasn't my baby!

983
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,754
You're all stupid bastards!

984
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,553
Come on, then!

985
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,617
I'll take the lot of you on!
Come on!

986
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,256
You think I'd hurt my baby?!

987
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,300
Do you think I'd hurt
me own baby?!

988
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,811
Ms. Hewitt?

989
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:01,818
Yeah.

990
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,013
There's a lot of bad feeling

991
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,851
about this musical
being canceled.

992
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,900
We've all, officers and inmates,
put a lot into it.

993
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,723
Mr. Jackson, I have been
called in on an emergency.

994
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:13,322
Right now this bloody musical
is the last thing on my mind.

995
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,421
Who canceled it?

996
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,932
I don't know.

997
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,833
All right.
You'll get one over, yeah?

998
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,397
Thanks a lot.

999
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,407
Is he ready?

1000
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,639
We need a camera, because this
didn't happen at our end.

1001
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,203
He arrived in this condition.

1002
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,839
We were told
that he resisted arrest

1003
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:33,077
and had to be restrained.

1004
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,812
Then we stripped him off.

1005
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,692
He's in bad shape.

1006
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,860
He fell on the stone steps,
but nobody touched him our end.

1007
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,864
I haven't finished
my examination yet,

1008
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,429
but he is going to need
a brain scan.

1009
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:58,499
âª The beautiful loser âª

1010
00:47:58,576 --> 00:47:59,576
Oh.

1011
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,576
His testicles are swollen.

1012
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:09,379
Thighs, shins, back, backside
in the same state as his chest.

1013
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,321
He's obviously been given
a very severe beating.

1014
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,234
I want him photographed.

1015
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,929
I want a list of names
of all the Barfield officers

1016
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,938
that were at reception.

1017
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,997
None of our lads did this.

1018
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,406
I said he fell,

1019
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,467
but, I mean, a fall wouldn't do
this much injury.

1020
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:37,640
I'm not making any accusations,
Gary, but somebody did this.

1021
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,207
Now, he should <i>never</i> have been
accepted back to Barfield

1022
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,582
in this condition.

1023
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,212
But he was,
so he's now our responsibility.

1024
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,450
Hey, he's conscious.

1025
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,457
Just.

1026
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,086
âª So I'm walking âª

1027
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,655
âª Yes, I'm walking âª

1028
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:58,032
âª I'll keep on walking âª

1029
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,594
âª Talking my way... âª

1030
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,867
Baby.

1031
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,406
Baby.

1032
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,912
I doubt we'll ever find out
who did it.

1033
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,174
You want to bet?

1034
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,225
I want to see the reception
officer, the wing governor,

1035
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,309
the duty governor,
and the principal officer.

1036
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,947
Oh. Gary, whose decision was it
to cancel the musical?

1037
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,014
Well, I suppose it was mine.

1038
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,184
I've had a tough enough fight
with the P.O.A.

1039
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,259
to keep that show going,

1040
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,228
so you can relay
to all those concerned

1041
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,788
that the musical goes ahead
as arranged.

1042
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:29,333
Who's going to oversee it?

1043
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,527
If necessary, I will.

1044
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,593
It's about time
I made my presence felt.

1045
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,048
It's time that everyone realized
I'm the governor of Barfield.

1046
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,405
- Governor.
- Gate 11 opening.

1047
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,476
- The show goes on?
- Yes. The show goes on.

1048
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,876
Governor.

1048
00:49:42,305 --> 00:50:42,746
