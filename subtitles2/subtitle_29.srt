JEFF PROBST: Previously on
<i>Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,270
It was down to the final four.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,907
We're in the home stretch,
and emotions are just all over

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,175
the map.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,778
PROBST: In which city and
state is Jessie a deputy

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,012
sheriff?

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,147
At the first of two final
immunity challenges, Kim

8
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,884
Johnson's memory led her to
victory, and Tom was voted out

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:20,852
of the tribe.

10
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,121
The tribe has spoken.

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,825
Under a blazing sun, the final
three took part in one last

12
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:31,663
endurance immunity challenge,
and Kim outlasted Ethan and Lex,

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,799
insuring her a place in the
final two.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,969
At Tribal Council, she voted Lex
out of the tribe...

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,205
Lex, the tribe has spoken.

16
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,643
Choosing to face the jury
with Ethan by her side.

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,680
When the final votes were
tallied, it was Ethan Zohn who

18
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,550
won the title, Sole Survivor.

19
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,720
Tonight, the final adventure
into the private lives of 16

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,822
Survivors back from Africa.

lives have been changed forever.

25
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,459
Tonight, we go beyond the game
and take you deeper into the

26
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,194
lives of those who have played.

27
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,895
From the unexpected...

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,997
I couldn't spell "Clarence."

29
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,332
I put "C.B."

30
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,669
There I am, 46 years old, on
national TV and can't spell.

31
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,603
Whoa, man!

32
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,972
PROBST: to the
revealing...

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,374
We've seen quite a bit of
her, you know, more than most

34
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,153
son-in-laws get to see of their
mother-in-law.

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,811
PROBST: to the families
they came home to.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,815
I cringe a little when one of
my friends says, "Oh, your son's

37
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,418
really hot!"
PROBST: Every Survivor has a

38
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,821
different way of keeping their
memories of the game alive.

39
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,357
Lex, well, he brought back...

40
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,426
A couple of baboon teeth.

41
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,495
PROBST: And Kelly?

42
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,097
Okay, I stole Clarence's war
paint.

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,566
PROBST: But our journey
begins with a man who's picked a

44
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:54,172
more unusual way to remember his
tribe mates.

45
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,876
And Kim Johnson, where's that
old goat at?

46
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:01,079
Come here, come here, Kim!

47
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,850
I just put their names on the
cattle.

48
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,521
They have some of their
characteristics.

49
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,159
I'm an animal person, and the
animals out in Africa was

50
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,663
probably one of the greatest
experiences I ever had in my

51
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,998
life.

52
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,945
There I was sitting right in the
middle of Wild Kingdom.

53
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,838
At 45, I thought I'd done some
things and I found out I ain't

54
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,273
done diddley.

55
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,576
This just shows me that there's
more to life then just what's

56
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,778
there around the corner at the
house.

57
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:37,449
(country tune playing)
I was pretty wild and rusty

58
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,990
in my younger days, and I had a
pretty big reputation before

59
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,228
<i>Survivor</i> come, and this just
added fuel to the flame.

60
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,431
I like all types of music.

61
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,400
I know about one line of every
song.

62
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:02,974
âª Honey, baby, mine... âª
I like music, I like to dance.

63
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,845
The Bluegrass, I grew up with, I
love it.

64
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:12,684
Tom has always had the
ability to get along with women.

65
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,587
I have never seen him meet a
woman that he can't talk to.

66
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,587
He's like a magnet.

67
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:24,657
He's witty and he's a bundle of
fun.

68
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,670
Something that makes me feel
vulnerable is spelling.

69
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:36,508
Clarence Black, he let the team
down.

70
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,175
I couldn't spell "Clarence."

71
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,511
I put "C.B."

72
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,114
There I am, 46 years old on
national TV and can't spell.

73
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:47,385
And I started a little reading
program, "Reading is the key to

74
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,287
Survival," because of that.

75
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,356
How ya'll doing?

76
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,123
Lookee here.

77
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,191
How'd I get him?

78
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,392
Which one's yours?

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,761
Attaboy, you got a lot of
feathers.

80
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,898
I think he realized right
then that he could do something

81
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,035
in our community to really help
to motivate these children to

82
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,503
read.

83
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:10,007
If I can help one kid be able
to read and spell, if I can help

84
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:16,481
one kid do better than me,
I'm... I'm glad it embarrassed

85
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,315
me.

86
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,351
Come to daddy, come to daddy.

87
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,723
I'm still not the sharpest tool
in the shed, but I'm still in

88
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,225
the shed, and I'm happy to be
here.

89
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:36,067
I'm even more happier than I was
before.

90
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,337
Since I've been back from
Africa, the job market's really

91
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,038
tough.

92
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,606
All right, thank you.

93
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,477
Taking all these small jobs and
I walk someone's dog as well,

94
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,581
for cash just because I need it.

95
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,887
I'll take up baby-sitting for
people, moms that I've met at

96
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,488
the gym.

97
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,791
Get off.

98
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,192
You want me to get off?

99
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,695
This was my luxury item that I
was able to bring into Africa

100
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:08,199
with me and this necklace has a
very special meaning to me.

101
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,935
It was given to me by my
brother.

102
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,004
And I wore it to Tribal Council
every time I went.

103
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,172
It was kind of my security.

104
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,507
I always had my necklace on.

105
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:20,044
In 1998, my brother was killed
in a very tragic accident.

106
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,148
Lex looks a little bit like my
brother, so every once in a

107
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,119
while, I would kind of get this
quick look of Lex and think, "oh

108
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,855
my gosh," you know, it looks
like him.

109
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,190
And it was just a reminder.

110
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,092
My brother, he really is here
with me.

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,562
He's here, making sure I'm okay.

112
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,512
It wasn't just about trying to
win $1 million, and it certainly

113
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,403
wasn't about just being on TV.

114
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:50,175
To me, it was much more about
the competition between me and

115
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:50,775
myself.

116
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,677
I have it!

117
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,579
Big Tom nicknamed me "Little
Bit."

118
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,617
He saw me and he thought, "that
little bit of a girl is going to

119
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,551
make it out here in Africa."

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,254
People would keep telling me how
small I was, and it really

121
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,323
angered me.

122
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:12,330
I was out there giving 150% of
everything I had to say, "You

123
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,632
can count on me.

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
I can handle this.

125
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,334
I'm strong."

126
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,837
I took so much away from the
game, and I learned so much

127
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,172
about myself.

128
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,875
There were moments of every
single day I spent out there

129
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,978
that I thought, "I want to go
home, I don't want to play this

130
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,712
game anymore."

131
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,647
PROBST: Keep going!

132
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,349
Kim, it's not over!

133
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:36,220
But somehow, some, some way,
I always pushed through that

134
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:36,888
feeling.

135
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,722
Come on, Powers.

136
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,023
You can do this, Powers.

137
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,025
Come on, one more.

138
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:40,959
Push.

139
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,293
And went on.

140
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,106
And that's the one thing that
I... I think I'll probably

141
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,831
always remember about playing
the game was that it was tough

142
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,935
and it was hard and I wanted to
give up, and I never did.

143
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:58,003
And that's the thing that I'll
always draw from.

144
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,882
âª When you're smiling
<i>When you're smiling</i>

145
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,751
âª When you're smiling
<i>When you're smiling</i>

146
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,021
âª Then the whole world
smiles with you

147
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,091
Smiles with you. âª
One thing about dentistry

148
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,828
that I really love is that once
I step into this role, and I'm

149
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,731
working on a patient, I don't
think about anything else.

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,099
Didn't hurt, did it?

151
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,034
Didn't feel a thing, did ya?

152
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,103
Saw patients all day, worked all
day, jump in the car put the top

153
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:32,977
down, put some tunes on and
cruise on home.

154
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,046
What do you drive?

155
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,779
You don't want to know what I
drive.

156
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,914
Yes, we do, yes, I do.

157
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:36,815
No, you don't want to know
what I drive.

158
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,082
Aw, tell me, Doc.

159
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,450
I'm not telling.

160
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,663
The question came up about
what kind of car I drive and

161
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,054
what kind of lifestyle I had.

162
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,257
I already knew that Silas was
trying to put in play, "Here's a

163
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,626
guy who doesn't need the million
dollars."

164
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,328
Doc getting out all his...

165
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,430
all his valuables and all his
money.

166
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,164
Mercedes!

167
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,265
I have one of those.

168
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,333
What else?

169
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,035
What do they say?

170
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,337
"Little boys grow up to be men
with bigger toys."

171
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,906
It's definitely true.

172
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,041
I like my toys.

173
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,875
A Porsche.

174
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,542
A Porsche.

175
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,844
You have a Porsche.

176
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,580
I drive a Porsche, pardon me,
you know what I mean.

177
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,950
I've worked my entire life to
get to this level, you know.

178
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:12,883
I'm not embarrassed of that.

179
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:13,751
That's the American dream.

180
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,153
That's what defines America.

181
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,888
I feel I epitomize the American
dream in my own right.

182
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,127
12 years old, I remember reading
Disney's autobiography, and he

183
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,896
had a little quote in there that
said, "If you can dream it, you

184
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:25,563
can do it."

185
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,298
And I live that way.

186
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,145
I dream... I dreamed that I
would be on<i> Survivor</i> no problem.

187
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,203
That experience in Africa
definitely changed me.

188
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:37,308
Look, I'm the old guy, okay, but
I know what needs to be done.

189
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,145
Every morning... fire, water and
food.

190
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,191
Well, of course, I went to get
the water because if I don't get

191
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,515
it, it's not going to get done.

192
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,094
You think anybody else gets off
their ass to do anything.

193
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,063
They thought they signed up to
go to the Y.M.C.A. and roast

194
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,957
marshmallows and maybe win a
million dollars, they're wrong.

195
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,627
After being out there for, I
guess, two and a half months and

196
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,530
not having family there, it's
changed him a lot, and he's more

197
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,365
willing to listen to people.

198
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,636
My wife said she should have
sent me 20 years ago, made me a

199
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,704
nicer person.

200
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,274
He seems genuinely sweeter,
kinder.

201
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:14,879
I think he really missed me a
lot, and his actions show it.

202
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,915
Life is fun and you don't
know what tomorrow's going to

203
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,483
bring.

204
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:19,784
So, go for it.

205
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,064
If you shoot for the stars,
if you miss, you may land

206
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,088
on the moon.

207
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,360
PROBST: When we come back,
Lindsey's darkest hour.

208
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,163
The most embarrassing moment
of my life, by far.

209
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,233
PROBST: And<i> Survivor's</i> most
colorful castaway.

210
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,069
I got my Catholic schoolgirl.

211
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,344
PROBST:<i> Survivor</i> has a way of
making strange bedfellows.

212
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,414
In our next group, one old-
fashioned guy, two strong-willed

213
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:54,985
women, and someone who clearly
is a different drummer.

214
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,388
One, two, three, four.

215
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,960
My life before<i> Survivor</i> was...

216
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,029
I had a good life, don't get me
wrong.

217
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,599
I spent about ten, 12 years
working in the high-tech

218
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,835
industry, surfing with my
buddies, and going out catching

219
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,237
a good surf.

220
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,939
But I never felt like I was
really cut out for that kind of

221
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,773
ordinary life.

222
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,443
Cool.

223
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,878
I've got some good tattoos.

224
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,014
I've got my devil head, Catholic
schoolgirl, samurai fighting a

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,315
snake.

226
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,884
Obviously, my wife and my kids,
huge part of my life.

227
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,921
My very favorite tattoos are the
ones my boys drew for me.

228
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,589
It's actually a drawing of me.

229
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,859
I've got my boy's names: Corbin
Ace Daniel; River's name is

230
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,294
right here.

231
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,775
When I got back from Africa, I
actually celebrated my ten-year

232
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,131
wedding anniversary.

233
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,967
My wife and I both got wedding
anniversary tattoos, you know,

234
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,468
ten years on the dice there.

235
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,405
My wife actually got one as
well, right there.

236
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,207
We're freaks.

237
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,844
I recall coming home, seeing my
wife and kids, being just so

238
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,813
stoked about seeing them.

239
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,950
Of course, my luxury item.

240
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,554
They're these shoes, they have
now taken a special place in my

241
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,922
home.

242
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,535
They'll always hang out with my
<i>Survivor</i> stuff now.

243
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,459
Hey, River, do you remember
these?

244
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,092
Yeah.

245
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,060
You wore these.

246
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,962
You learned to walk in these
shoes.

247
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,563
I know.

248
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,964
Yeah.

249
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,377
Really the only thing that
has ever really been important

250
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,945
to me has been my family and my
friends.

251
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:20,638
âª Sleep all day... âª
I play in a band called Lucky

252
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,641
Dog, with friends of mine for
almost 20 years.

253
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,577
We play here in Santa Cruz...
All original music.

254
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,579
We have such a good time doing
it.

255
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,982
It's always been a huge part of
my life.

256
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:35,019
(laughing)
Africa is... is nothing like the

257
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,458
states.

258
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,604
You might as well have taken 16
of us and dropped us on Mars or

259
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,961
on the moon.

260
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,398
I didn't anticipate that it was
really going to be quite as

261
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,866
dangerous as it was.

262
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,669
I thought to myself, "We all
know it's going to be tough, but

they're obviously not going to

He's right outside the fence.

269
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:08,920
(growling)
The drinking water.

270
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,457
We show up, you know, at our
drinking water hole, at the

271
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,560
spring, expecting that it's
going to be something pretty

272
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,093
safe.

273
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,228
This is mud.

274
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,031
I came home pretty sick.

275
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,967
The first three weeks back here
was spent pretty much just doing

276
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,335
a lot of this.

277
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,804
My doctor found no less than
four different parasites and a

278
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,405
couple of different bacteria.

279
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,610
I have to take so many pills,
probably like almost a dozen.

280
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,982
I'm still dealing with the
results of being out there in a

281
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,485
dangerous, hazardous, very real
place.

282
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,690
Almost the first question I'm
always asked by people is, "Did

283
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,425
you have fun and would you do it
again?"

284
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,696
And I had the time of my life
and I would do it again in a

285
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,765
heartbeat.

286
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,508
Being on<i> Survivor,</i> going to
Kenya for seven weeks this

287
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,945
summer was extremely meaningful,
very important to me.

288
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,616
This place can just... can just
fill our spirits!

289
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,118
I don't know if they're spirits
or what.

290
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,521
I just feel very protected in
Africa.

291
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,190
Life is different now for me.

292
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,691
I'm still the same person.

293
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,492
Come here.

294
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,860
Did your mama never hug you?

295
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,396
But there's definitely been a
transformation.

296
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,864
I think I'm calmer.

297
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:31,002
I think I'm more focused now in
terms of what's really important

298
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,937
in life: family, friends.

299
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,638
Good job, very good job.

300
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,742
I wasn't the least bit
surprised that she wanted to do

301
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,143
<i>Survivor.</i>

302
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,213
I've seen her passions escalate
from race walking to roller

303
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:46,550
blading to mountain climbing,
now yoga.

304
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:52,290
When she gets an interest, she
gets very passionate about it.

305
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,660
Once I was diagnosed with
thyroid cancer, when I heard

306
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,862
those words, "You have cancer,"
I felt like my life was spinning

307
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,231
out of control.

308
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,735
It was soon after, very soon
after, that I decided to climb

309
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,169
Mount Rainier.

310
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,806
And each time I take a trip it's
not about reaching the summit.

311
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,007
It's not the destination.

312
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,342
It's about the journey.

313
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:19,411
So it's really a metaphor for
how I try to live my life.

314
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,624
She always has a positive
attitude and she's always

315
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,893
telling me, "Go for your
dreams."

316
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,094
PROBST: Get them ready.

317
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,662
Keep them down on the ground.

318
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,600
I never went on<i> Survivor</i> for
fortune or fame.

319
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,936
I went because I was looking for
an exciting, interesting and

320
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,170
challenging adventure.

321
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,939
PROBST: Linda!

322
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:48,513
This show has taught me to
live my dreams, to go for it.

323
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,981
That life is the ultimate
adventure.

324
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,719
If you have a dream, you have a
goal, you have a desire, go for

325
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,787
it!

326
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,628
Woo!

327
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,196
I was at a point in my life I
think where things were getting

328
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,700
a little monotonous, plugging
along, working out, you know,

329
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,768
training on my bike...

330
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,573
flying back and forth to see
my boyfriend.

331
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,176
I hope my boyfriend doesn't wake
up some mornings and think,

332
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,014
"God, what is next to me?"
And I was ready for something,

333
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:27,685
just something big and exciting
to just, kind of... turn my life

334
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,452
around.

335
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,055
I got me a tick on my ass!

336
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,690
Ow!

337
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,492
Lindsey is who she is.

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,627
What you see is what you get.

339
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,697
That kind of sums up her
personality.

340
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,400
Competitive.

341
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,235
Emotional.

342
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:48,372
I just started to cry because I
felt sad, and we're all stressed

343
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,039
out and...

344
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:49,907
Intense.

345
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:50,875
Oh, okay.

346
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,075
Emotional.

347
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,944
(<i> laughing</i>)
Competitive.

348
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,214
Wait, towards me.

349
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,648
Damn it!

350
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,918
I just went back and forth, from
one to another.

351
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,221
Barbie went down in Africa.

352
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,756
I never feel pain.

353
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,825
I'm not one to hide what I'm
feeling.

354
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,560
I just started my period.

355
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,229
No wonder I have cramps!

356
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,298
Mm-hmm.

357
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,532
Yeah, that was a great moment,
wasn't it?

358
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,603
The most embarrassing moment of
my life, by far.

359
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,971
Excuse me, Africa, you know?

360
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,839
We're not down at the mall here,
you know.

361
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:26,910
Big, big mistake, coming out
of my big, big mouth.

362
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,291
And trust me, when I'm pumped,
you don't want to (bleep) with

363
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,315
me!

364
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,960
(gasping)
I think she said the F-word.

365
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,117
He said, "Nah."

366
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,852
I said, "Are you sure?"
And he said, "Well, no."

367
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,522
She speaks her mind.

368
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,325
She's extremely honest and
truthful and up front with

369
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,293
people.

370
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,028
Don't underestimate me, people!

371
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,164
She's a really fun, fun girl.

372
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,465
And I think that...

373
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,469
You're with me because I'm
fun? That's all?

374
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,470
Oh, my God.

375
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,141
Well, you are sometimes.

376
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,709
Give me a kiss.

377
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,611
I'm very sensitive.

378
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,014
I'm almost too sensitive
sometimes.

379
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,218
This show just... just boosted
me up in maturity a little bit

380
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,486
more.

381
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,824
It wasn't positive seeing some
of the ways I handled

382
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,124
situations.

383
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,061
PROBST: Lindsey, have you
made any mistakes so far?

384
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,529
I'm a walking mistake.

385
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,264
I think I grew a lot from it.

386
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,411
Lindsey, would you go boil
some water for us please?

387
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,435
(laughter)
What you saw on<i> Survivor</i>

388
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,110
was... was me, the real deal.

389
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,211
No, just go!

390
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,347
Just come around the corner.

391
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,116
You know, Frank Garrison is not
going to change, and either you

392
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,417
like me or you don't like me.

393
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,720
It really doesn't weigh heavily
on my mind.

394
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,422
Going to make two huge S's here
on each side.

395
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,626
I was worried that Frank
would come back a different

396
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,026
person.

397
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,729
That it would really affect him
and change him dramatically.

398
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,266
I can't help it if these
little liberal special interest

399
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,200
groups that the media give open
market to...

400
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,371
But Frank is Frank, and
three days after he was back, I

401
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,106
knew he was the same man that he
was when he left.

402
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,442
We're going, bud.

403
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,242
We're going.

404
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,510
Let's go home, guys.

405
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,181
Frank can be the most
charming, sweet and lovable

406
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,151
person, and the biggest jerk in
the next breath.

407
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,953
Let's just get moving along.

408
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,723
(beeping)
Jocelyn Rose up and at them.

409
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:20,491
Let's go!

410
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,327
Come on, guys.

411
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,896
Frank, we just hit the snooze
button.

412
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,100
My life's philosophy in
general is to get up early in

413
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:29,833
the morning.

414
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,236
Okay, can I have a kiss?

415
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,770
I love you!

416
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,072
Kiss your wife and children.

417
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,239
See you later, alligator!

418
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,375
Go to work.

419
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,243
Give the man 100%.

420
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,811
He gives you a little bit back.

421
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,747
And come immediately home, and
spend time with the family.

422
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,117
He's a very loving father.

423
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,653
Would you like a cup of coffee?

424
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,690
And a very loving husband.

425
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,293
We found out I was pregnant the
day before we got the call that

426
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,162
he was actually going to Africa.

427
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,066
And when Frank left, there was
something missing in the whole

428
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,334
family dynamic.

429
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,970
What was missing was his
enthusiasm for life, and his

430
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,407
zest for everything that he
does.

431
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,774
Very good.

432
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,376
Straight arrow.

433
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,045
See how nice and straight that
went?

434
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:18,048
When I think of my dad, I
think of hugging.

435
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:24,155
I think of sharing, and I think
of being a leader.

436
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,623
Samburu!

437
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,929
The things that were
important to me prior to

438
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,731
<i>Survivor</i> are the same things
that are important to me now:

439
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,235
Providing my family with the
basics of food, shelter and

440
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:43,273
security, but most importantly,
love.

441
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,378
PROBST: Coming up, we go hot
tubbing with Mama Kim...

442
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,714
and mud-slinging with just about
everybody.

443
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,784
Clarence, I just didn't like
him worth snot.

444
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,059
PROBST: Welcome back.

445
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,228
Well, at the end of every Tribal
Council, the person voted out

446
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,931
has to leave immediately.

447
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,335
Once the tribe has spoken, the
departing Survivor can't.

448
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,539
So we decided to give them a
chance for a parting shot.

449
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,040
Clarence Black.

450
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,375
Oh, Clarence.

451
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,144
Loves to talk about himself.

452
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,145
Like him a lot.

453
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,213
He's my favorite.

454
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,850
I just didn't like him worth
snot.

455
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,153
Kelly Goldsmith, off with her
head.

456
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:29,954
Woo!

457
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,488
Cut it right off.

458
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,457
Lex, eccentric.

459
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,861
Lex is like a 16 year old
living in a 40 year old's body.

460
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:37,795
Eh.

461
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,962
Lindsey Richter.

462
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,264
A bit of a whiner.

463
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,131
Emotional.

464
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:41,999
Emotional.

465
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,900
Emotional.

466
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,034
You're sweet.

467
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:44,968
You were in over your head,
though, sweetie.

468
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,103
Okay.

469
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,171
Tom.

470
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,138
Yeah.

471
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,474
A dirty, old pervert that I
love.

472
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,409
Good ole...

473
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,243
Country boy.

474
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,244
It's a sickness.

475
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,144
It's a sickness.

476
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,312
Silas Gaither.

477
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,514
That smile could knock your
socks off.

478
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,583
You love yourself.

479
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,350
Ethan Zohn.

480
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,285
Quiet.

481
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:05,356
(sighs)
Super sweet guy, shy.

482
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,124
Um...

483
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,193
Mr. Lovable.

484
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,294
Great hair.

485
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,195
Frank.

486
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:12,830
Frankie.

487
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,731
Hardcore.

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,065
Green beret.

489
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:15,966
Trying to be sensitive here.

490
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,669
Frank and his deer antlers.

491
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,171
Brandon...

492
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,407
in a different world.

493
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,042
Good job, Frank.

494
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,944
Jessie, what a woman.

495
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:27,644
Me?

496
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,846
Hot.

497
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,815
(laughs)
Kim Johnson.

498
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,984
Wait a minute, let me think
on this one.

499
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:34,685
Dear God.

500
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:35,754
Probably be clever.

501
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,287
Honest.

502
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:45,357
Like my mom, I got along with
her great.

503
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,301
There's nothing more
important to me in my life than

504
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,603
my family.

505
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,906
I've got three kids, all
married; three grandchildren,

506
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,040
one on the way.

507
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,543
It doesn't get much better than
that.

508
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:00,744
Hello there.

509
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,813
My oldest child is Wendy.

510
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,649
Wendy and her family only live
four miles from me.

511
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,017
Hello, hello!

512
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,086
(laughing)
Yeah.

513
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,256
Our son, Teddy, just got married
two weeks after I got home from

514
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,657
Africa.

515
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,928
My middle child, Kerry, just had
the most beautiful baby boy.

516
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,298
We spend as much time as we can
with them, where they live in

517
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,366
Durango, Colorado.

518
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,801
Growing up was... was tough.

519
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,005
It was really just my mom and
myself.

520
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,673
I was really more the mom.

521
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,344
We had a lot of problems...
Health-wise, money-wise, every-

522
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,711
wise.

523
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,181
I never really had a warm and
loving relationship until my

524
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:38,815
husband.

525
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,884
Come on, Sierra.

526
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,118
Ted and I met when we were in
college.

527
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,922
He's been my best friend ever
since.

528
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,956
Kim was 19 when we got married.

529
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:51,262
The way she grew up, it gave her
the resolve to really put her

530
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,830
all into making everything work.

531
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,699
We've really helped keep each
other young.

532
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,802
I probably do look like a
grandmother, but I don't think

533
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,137
most of the time I act like a
grandmother.

534
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,743
When she gets her mind made
up on something, there's just no

535
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,110
stopping her.

536
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,949
At my age, which is 57...
Ouch... my life is... is pretty

537
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,350
much set.

538
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,063
I'm not going to go out in the
street and hang out with a guy

539
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,065
full of tattoos and say, "Hey,
what's your life like?"

540
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,422
Yes!

541
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,391
It was so cool to be able to
spend time with people different

542
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,359
from me.

543
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,127
As far as the thong thing
goes...

544
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,495
Whoa, man!

545
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,409
I didn't go there with the
idea of taking off my pants.

546
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,965
Women in her thong there.

547
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,079
We had people over in our
apartment and then they showed

548
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,436
scenes from next week.

549
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,116
All of a sudden the thong was
out there, and the place went

550
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,038
crazy.

551
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,440
Anything to get this challenge.

552
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,487
We've seen quite a bit of
her, more than most son-in-laws

553
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,822
get to see of their mother-in-
law, so that's... that's been a

554
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,545
big plus, too.

555
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,513
You and the whole town.

556
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:47,418
Yeah, well, and all our friends.

557
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,088
I came away from this
experience with a reaffirmation

558
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:57,060
of my ability to do what I want
to do when I want to do it.

559
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:05,129
It's probably the coolest thing
I've ever done.

560
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,544
Every day, I like to
basically start with a devotion.

561
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,780
"For God so loved the world that
he gave his only son."

562
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,348
I focus on the day ahead and...

563
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,284
and, you know, I read a... a
chapter from the Bible a day,

564
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,765
and it just kind of gets, you
know, my priorities straight and

565
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,988
that sort of thing.

566
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,458
Coming from Tennessee to Los
Angeles was a huge move.

567
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,260
I'm trying to make it as an
actor.

568
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,564
And I try to read a script a
day, and bartending to make ends

569
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:34,531
meet.

570
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,710
It's a dog-eat-dog world out
there.

571
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,534
This is the green machine.

572
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,870
But, man, I absolutely love it
here.

573
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:40,737
The beach, man.

574
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,305
The temperature is perfect.

575
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,041
Welcome to sunny California.

576
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,643
The sun's shining bright.

577
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,878
I mean, it's just absolutely
amazing.

578
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,312
You ready to rock?

579
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,817
You know, depending on the day,
I try to knock in a... a good

580
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,019
day of surfing.

581
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,788
It's that carpe diem mentality.

582
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,030
<i>Survivor</i> helped me in the fact
that there's an unpredictability

583
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,430
about it, you know?

584
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,067
PROBST: Silas, Teresa, Frank,
you guys are now members of

585
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,068
Boran.

586
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,002
The switch meant the game for
me.

587
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,837
Smokes.

588
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,372
I never saw that coming.

589
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,681
Right when I got kicked off,
I couldn't sleep for a week!

590
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,844
Just now, I mean, I'm finally
starting to forget and relax and

591
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,979
just, you know, really come down
from it.

592
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,416
You know, it's funny when you're
in Africa, it's a place to,

593
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,753
like, really think about life
and think about the importance

594
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,621
of life and like what we live
for.

595
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,125
If you were going to die
tomorrow, it's relationships,

596
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,762
and the relationship that I have
with God and my family and

597
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,564
friends and loved ones, man.

598
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,210
I mean, that's, to me, that's
the most important thing in

599
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,234
life.

600
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,774
I love proving people wrong.

601
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,976
I think that's my thing.

602
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,346
Men that say that women can't do
the same thing that men can do.

603
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,280
Well, guess what?

604
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,983
I love proving men wrong.

605
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,757
The reason why I love police
work is because it's a job where

606
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,160
you can do something about
society.

607
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:14,765
My grandpa was a cop in Puerto
Rico, retired 25 years.

608
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,734
I've heard all the stories.

609
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,368
I just fell in love with it.

610
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,739
Now I'm working for the
Sheriff's Department, and I love

611
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,572
it.

612
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,007
She's a good cop, good cop.

613
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:31,381
Behind the cop, I am probably
the coolest chick you'll ever

614
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:31,949
know.

615
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,050
No, no, no...

616
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,484
I'm a big kid at heart.

617
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,054
I like to do spontaneous things.

618
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,523
Boxing is a good stress
reliever.

619
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,804
Your only concentration is on
trying to get that person, and

620
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,038
try to hit 'em and knock 'em
out.

621
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,029
(laughs)
It's fun.

622
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,500
My sister was the one that made
me do<i> Survivor.</i>

623
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,803
She's a tough girl.

624
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,108
<i>Survivor</i> in Africa was so
much tougher than I thought it

625
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,343
would be.

626
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:02,612
I never expected the water
conditions to be so bad.

627
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,049
Throwing up when you have so
little hydration to go around,

628
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,951
it's bad for her, it's bad for
us.

629
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,786
PROBST: Jessie, the tribe has
spoken.

630
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,234
When I was voted off and I
thought, "Wow, you know, I just

631
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,257
disappointed my sister."

632
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:22,566
Once the show was over, I
actually stayed an extra month

633
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:27,437
in Africa, and helped out in the
community project, building a

634
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,873
lodge, working with the Masai.

635
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,409
Working with them was excellent.

636
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,744
I mean, it was such a great
experience.

637
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:40,250
And I don't think I'll ever,
ever, ever forget that.

638
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,321
Brandon was the hottest,
sexiest, smartest guy on

639
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,154
<i>Survivor.</i>

640
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:45,989
Aah!

641
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,458
I know he didn't look like it.

642
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,224
Sorry.

643
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:48,992
But Brandon was the bomb.

644
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,061
Uh-huh.

645
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,931
I got a date with Frank!

646
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,433
I got a date with Frank!

647
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,170
I may have had my outlandish
moments, but I was secure enough

648
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,374
to be on a hit show, proclaiming
that I was gay, and it didn't

649
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,542
bother me if everybody knew it.

650
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,644
Are you gay?

651
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,045
Uh-huh, I am.

652
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,681
They put me with people that
they suspected would dislike me

653
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,049
for that very reason.

654
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,519
Brandon would be the last
person on earth I would pick.

655
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,520
You know what?

656
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,665
I got along with them all very
well.

657
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,555
Go, Brandon!

658
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,224
I'm not a very good bartender.

659
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,160
And when I first started, I used
to tell people, you didn't come

660
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,094
because you thought I'd make a
good drink.

661
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,030
I always look good.

662
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,499
Brandon's skills as a
bartender sometimes leave a lot

663
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,500
to be desired.

664
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,169
What he serves best is the
attitude.

665
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,238
What do you want?

666
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,604
A drink!

667
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,273
I work in the leather bar...
Big, burly guys, and I'm not

668
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,608
that.

669
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,917
I'm just a little almost-used-
to-be-chicken kind of guy.

670
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:45,181
I had never gone camping.

671
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,989
First time I ever slept in a
camping situation was my first

672
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,291
night in Africa under those
stars.

673
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,559
Oh, my goodness!

674
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,664
It made me realize that I really
can do anything if I set my mind

675
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,364
to it.

676
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,632
C'mon, dude, let's go!

677
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,546
Brandon always said the
reason he wanted to be on

678
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,970
<i>Survivor</i> was because there was
no one on TV that he felt

679
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,238
portrayed him.

680
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,307
I think he wanted to show
America a gay man in their

681
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,211
middle 20s who's getting out on
his own and finding his way and

682
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
coming to grow as a person.

683
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,748
To Brandon!

684
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,288
The Walt Whitman School is
for gay and lesbian teenagers

685
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,557
who have been tormented in their
schools and abused.

686
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,193
How did the other tribe
members feel about you being a

687
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,060
homosexual?

688
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,409
I'm just a normal gay person.

689
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,764
Some of those kids might see me
and maybe take a little

690
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,567
inspiration, and that makes me
feel very good.

691
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:41,238
Just because I'm gay, don't
assume certain things about me.

692
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:45,508
You just never know what kind of
person you're dealing with until

693
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,910
you get to know them.

694
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,379
And that's really all I want to
say.

695
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:54,751
PROBST: When we come back,
she's hard-driving, yet soft.

696
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,220
Are you calling me
schizophrenic?

697
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,767
PROBST: And later, the softer
side of the hard-driving guy who

698
00:30:58,791 --> 00:30:59,791
won it all.

699
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,892
I'm in touch with my feminine
side.

700
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,266
Her fellow Survivors called her
the smartest girl out there.

701
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:13,270
She says she's just a homebody
with a wild streak learning to

702
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,104
live in L.A.

703
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,672
From the beginning...

704
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,806
Go!

705
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,875
I was out-manned by everybody.

706
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,121
I thought I was going to pass
out.

707
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,690
I felt like I was the worst
athlete there.

708
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:25,615
I thought I was definitely the
first person voted off.

709
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,650
But the snake pit that is
<i>Survivor...</i>

710
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,586
We cut Kelly off tonight.

711
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,720
We take her out.

712
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,122
Are you sure?

713
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,390
I'm sure.

714
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,392
Made me uniquely prepared to
live in Los Angeles.

715
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,530
My days usually begin with a
workout.

716
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,267
Okay, guys, what do all good
Californians do?

717
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,168
Go to the gym!

718
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,705
Three, two, one, all right.

719
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,873
All right.

720
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,376
By day, I edit.

721
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,045
I'm a behavioral research
analyst.

722
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,581
What I do is very, very detail-
oriented.

723
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,449
I edit books.

724
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,450
I mean, it's interesting to me.

725
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,751
I love academics.

726
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,986
I love research.

727
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:07,590
But part of me is a big
homebody... crocheting.

728
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,460
It's... it's my weird
introverted habit.

729
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,664
I made this myself, and it's
big.

730
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,200
It's really, actually, if you
look at it, it's not straight.

731
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,201
But don't tell anybody.

732
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,803
I usually actually make pillows.

733
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:21,271
Oh, I have one of those, too.

734
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,705
Pillows are my favorite.

735
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,986
Well, I can't reach it because
it's on the top shelf, but trust

736
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,842
me that I have a pillow.

737
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,844
I really... I can't sit still.

738
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,713
But then there's this other side
of me.

739
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,383
I hop in my car, drive way too
fast.

740
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,617
I love to cut loose.

741
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,486
I love to, you know, be wild.

742
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,254
And then, you know, I come back.

743
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,324
I love to crochet.

744
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,057
Are you calling me
schizophrenic?

745
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,259
I love baking cookies.

746
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,294
The secret is that I'm just a
big dork at heart.

747
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,728
It's just who I am.

748
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,798
But, yeah, that's me.

749
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:56,706
Before I left for<i> Survivor,</i>
I was working a lot.

750
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,643
My mom, who's my best friend
and... you know, she was even

751
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,546
saying, "Teresa, I'm telling
you, you're...

752
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,681
You're not spending enough time
with your children.

753
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,750
You're working too much."

754
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,989
Teresa doesn't want to be a
real estate agent.

755
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,391
She wants to be the best real
estate agent, because that's

756
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,259
just the way she is.

757
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,229
She's basically a corporation.

758
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,867
She was gone a long time, 48
days, with no communication.

759
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,169
It was a long time.

760
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,405
I obviously missed her, and the
kids missed her.

761
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:34,210
I told my husband Brian when
I left and the way I looked at

762
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,047
it was, "I'm not going on a
summer vacation to Africa.

763
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,715
I'm not going on a safari.

764
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,583
I'm going on a business trip."

765
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:44,654
The objective of the business
trip was to go out there and be

766
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:52,061
the last one standing of 16
people.

767
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,496
It's just mind over matter.

768
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,833
It's just a matter of saying,
"I'm going to stand up here, and

769
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,402
I'm going to be the last one, no
matter what."

770
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:03,606
I get really scared every
night because I'm afraid my mom

771
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,643
could get voted off that night
and, like, she could lose a

772
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,711
challenge.

773
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,484
PROBST: Six hours, 20
seconds.

774
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,218
You, my dear, get this.

775
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,020
Thank you.

776
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,655
PROBST: Congratulations.

777
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,101
I kept thinking about my
children.

778
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,565
I kept thinking about Tyler and
Elly.

779
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:26,529
And I kept thinking about
watching the show with them and

780
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,232
them seeing their mom, one of
the oldest ones, and just

781
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:36,406
thinking how proud they would
be.

782
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,010
When I was out in Africa, I had
so much time to think about

783
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:48,078
family and what's really, really
important.

784
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:52,622
I started making a mental list
in my mind of things I wanted to

785
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,690
change when I got back home.

786
00:34:54,759 --> 00:35:00,330
Reading to the kids more, saying
their prayers with them at

787
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,597
night.

788
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,867
Saying the blessing at the
dinner table every night.

789
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,769
Giving Brian more back rubs.

790
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,839
I might regret saying that.

791
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,976
When I was watching her plane
to come in, she was the one of

792
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:16,079
the last ones to get off, and
then when she got off, I was the

793
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,014
first one to run up there and
hug her.

794
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,283
It felt great.

795
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:25,021
As opposed to me just
being... being a mom and a good

796
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,493
friend, hopefully they'll see me
as a role model, and say, "Hey,

797
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,561
Mom, that's pretty cool."

798
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:33,897
I'm a city kid.

799
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,297
I've grown up in the city.

800
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,134
The city is where I'm from.

801
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,869
Before<i> Survivor,</i> I was a
financial consultant.

802
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,081
Clarence was my stockbroker.

803
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,405
How you doing, Mr. Green?

804
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,775
So we made some investments,
that we was able to turn a

805
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,444
profit and open a business...

806
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,915
I was, I guess, in that rat
race, just like everybody else:

807
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,882
9:00 to 5:00 job.

808
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,818
It just wasn't for me.

809
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,087
In my first trip out of the
country, I'm seeing animals and

810
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,491
I'm seeing a way of life that
I... that I can't even conceive

811
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,292
of.

812
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:02,992
I could still see him, too.

813
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,227
I don't want to move.

814
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,362
It was just an awesome
experience, and the food was

815
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,764
good, too.

816
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,711
When I see a gazelle now, I
think, like, "Man, you're a good

817
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:10,633
piece of meat."

818
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,636
(laughter)
Notice how everything

819
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,404
eventually came back to food.

820
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:18,107
When they said, "I think
Clarence took two cherries," the

821
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,077
first thought was, "Yeah,
Clarence took two cherries."

822
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,545
I want to be a food critic.

823
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,014
I'm going to be called the man's
man's food critic.

824
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,585
All right, we got ourselves some
barbecue, all up in here.

825
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,986
My man doing it up.

826
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,555
We got some mac and cheese,
Greens.

827
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,157
That's a delicacy there, baby.

828
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,927
If there's one thing being on
<i>Survivor's</i> taught me is... be

829
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:38,928
yourself.

830
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,063
I came back feeling like, "Wow,
man.

831
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,900
I've got to come up with some
new goals."

832
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:47,637
It made me want to go see more
of these exotic places that are

833
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:53,776
out there and not just be a city
dweller.

834
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,547
(alarm clock beeping)
My life as a single mom, it's

835
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,349
not a chore, it's not a duty.

836
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:00,983
It's a way of life for me.

837
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,119
I get ready for work.

838
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,287
I always wear makeup.

839
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,991
It makes me feel like I'm ready
for the day.

840
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,425
That's it!

841
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,796
Just enjoying a little bit of
downtime before going off to the

842
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,131
post office and another hectic
day.

843
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,099
Good morning.

844
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,733
Then I wake my son up.

845
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,102
Got a kiss?

846
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,305
The whole time we were over in
Africa, we couldn't make any

847
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,873
contact with our family.

848
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,975
<i>En guard!</i>

849
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,143
I wanted to just say, "I'm
okay, Alex.

850
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,911
I didn't get eaten up by a
lion."

851
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
My safe return!

852
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,147
My home's great.

853
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,248
I love my home.

854
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,517
It's bright, it's fun, it's
happy.

855
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,920
I'm bright and fun and happy,
so...

856
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,423
You feel like you're inside a
box of colors.

857
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:44,260
And when you go into another
house, you just feel like you're

858
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,462
in a regular box of brown or
white.

859
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,865
I'm real good at my job.

860
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,768
I am real good at carrying mail.

861
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:56,539
The audience, they didn't get to
know me.

862
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,174
I did not open the can for me.

863
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,508
I opened the can for her.

864
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,609
The bean incident.

865
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,477
That's a lie!

866
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,812
Clarence, that is not.

867
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:03,346
Diane!

868
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,113
He lied.

869
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,448
He knows he lied.

870
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,485
I think I'm a little more
sensitive than I was before I

871
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,587
left.

872
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,256
I don't take anything for
granted anymore.

873
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,024
I love you, baby.

874
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:15,892
Good night, Mom.

875
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
I love you.

876
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,098
PROBST: Ahead on<i>
Survivor: Back from Africa...</i>

877
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,268
You don't have to be an evil,
back-stabbing person to do well

878
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,136
in this game.

879
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,939
PROBST: What it took to win.

880
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,778
In the end, it was the
professional soccer player and

881
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,181
coach from Lexington,
Massachusetts, who was the sole

882
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,617
Survivor.

883
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,853
He won it with his strength, his
smarts, but mostly by sticking

884
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,922
to his principles.

885
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:54,764
Before he left for Africa, I
said to him, "Ethan, it's not

886
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,800
that important that you come
home with $1 million, but you

887
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,769
know what you have to come home
with.

888
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,104
You have to come home with your
integrity."

889
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,941
I said to myself, like,
"listen, I'm not going to change

890
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,809
who I am as a person to be on
the show.

891
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,145
I want to come back with my
dignity and self-respect."

892
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:12,114
When I come home to Lexington,
that's where I grew up, then I

893
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,783
usually make a grand entrance.

894
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,585
(cheers)
That kid's got, you got my hair

895
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,352
back there.

896
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,121
(laughter)
I like that.

897
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,323
Usually I go on and, you know,
see my brother.

898
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,892
He's a chiropractor.

899
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,459
Hi.

900
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,827
Doing okay?

901
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,141
So he gives me a little
adjustment to straighten me out

902
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,331
a bit.

903
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,443
I stop, I see my mom in her
little knitting store.

904
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,034
Hi, Mommy.

905
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,535
Ethan!

906
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,170
I think he's appealing to women.

907
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,907
I mean, I cringe a little when
one of my friends say, "Oh, your

908
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,576
son's really hot!"
I've always liked women.

909
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,646
Maybe because I was brought up
by my mom, I didn't have... I

910
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,515
was sensitive, you know, the
whole sensitive guy thing.

911
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,451
I'm in touch with my feminine
side.

912
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,521
Maybe it's because I doted on
him so much after his father

913
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,988
died.

914
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:57,927
The biggest tragedy in his life
was when his father died, and he

915
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,096
was just 14 years old.

916
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:05,167
He got diagnosed with colon
cancer, and I think from the

917
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,605
time he was diagnosed to when he
passed away, it was maybe a

918
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,040
year.

919
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,554
No matter where Ethan went in
the evening, you know, he knew

920
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:18,681
he had to be home about 10:30,
11:00 to help get his father up

921
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,082
the stairs.

922
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,653
He could be, you know, having
the best time of his life, but

923
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:27,323
he was home, come 10:30, 11:00.

924
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,259
If my husband woke up in the
middle of the night, I couldn't

925
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:34,030
lift him or take him where he
needed to go, he'd say, "Okay,

926
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,498
Dad, I'm going to count to
three.

927
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:40,670
Put your arms around my neck,
and I'll lift you."

928
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,374
And that's what would happen
time and time again.

929
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,743
Having my father pass away
and, kind of, me overcoming

930
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,646
that, you know, I could have...

931
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:53,049
is definitely, you know, my
first lesson in survival, I

932
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,587
guess, in being a survivor,
because I could have easily, you

933
00:40:57,656 --> 00:41:02,325
know, gone the whole drug route,
drop out of school, you know, be

934
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:03,826
depressed my whole life.

935
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:07,463
I feel there was a change in
him after that, a sense of

936
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:10,433
intensity that I didn't see
before.

937
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:14,369
I wanted to push forward and
try to succeed and be the best I

938
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,273
could possibly be at everything
that I've done.

939
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:20,943
Let's go, blue!

940
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,978
Yeah!

941
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,280
You know, I never thought in a
million years that I'd be

942
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,482
playing professional soccer.

943
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,017
It was always a dream of mine.

944
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,385
Easy! Easy!

945
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:35,057
I played for the United States
Maccabee team, and I went to

946
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,458
Africa.

947
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,563
I went to Zimbabwe, and I was
one of two white people in the

948
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,730
entire league.

949
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,400
Walking into a stadium...

950
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:48,604
(crowd cheering)
with 50,000 people is just

951
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,073
uplifting.

952
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,808
Every time I step on the field,
every time I put my cleats on, I

953
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,011
just, you know, get that energy,
that buzz that you get when, you

954
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,548
know, it's... you're doing
something you love.

955
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,049
You got it baby, you got it!

956
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,787
PROBST: There it is!

957
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,889
<i>Survivor</i> is a brilliant game.

958
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,002
You're hungry all the time.

959
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,066
You're tired all the time.

960
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,393
You're dirty all the time.

961
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:11,927
You're thirsty all the time.

962
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,130
And then you have to make
friends with people.

963
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,798
You have to perform in
challenges.

964
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,635
(cheering)
You have to perform in mental

965
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,704
challenges.

966
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,283
You know, you've got to watch
your back.

967
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:25,808
But you don't have to be an
evil, back-stabbing person to do

968
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,143
well in this game.

969
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,279
You can be a nice, honest,
genuine person and become the

970
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,348
ultimate Survivor.

971
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,759
PROBST: Up next, a look ahead
to the remote Pacific Island

972
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:48,831
where 16 new Survivors will face
the challenge of a lifetime.

973
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,082
PROBST: Soon, 16 new
strangers will be abandoned in

974
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,973
the middle of the most remote
place on earth, the Marquesas,

975
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,310
part of Tahiti's mystical
islands in the South Pacific.

976
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,414
Thousands of miles from the
nearest continent, it is a lush

977
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,882
and tropical environment and
home to some of the most

978
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,231
dangerous sea life in the world.

979
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:12,088
And for the first time, these
Survivors will be given no

980
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,455
rations whatsoever.

981
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,190
It is the ultimate challenge.

982
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,430
Outwit, outplay, outlast until
only one remains and emerges as

983
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:21,997
the sole Survivor.

984
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,732
Well, that's it for tonight.

985
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,401
I'm Jeff Probst.
