ï»¿1
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,490
Young master, it's ready.

2
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,326
-Good job, young master.
-Here's your towel, young master.

3
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:06,836
What did the young master write?

4
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:07,796
His name.

5
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:09,881
That's great!

6
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:12,217
Now, it's just me who knows that
young master can write his name!

7
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,802
-Yes.
-Fuck.

8
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,392
It's nice.

9
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,727
Let me see it!

10
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:29,651
This is nice! It reads "the flamboyant
So Cha Ha Yee Chan"!

11
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,194
You've read it backwards, master.

12
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:33,488
"Chan Yee Ha Cha So."

13
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,866
Good boy, but don't be smug! Got me?

14
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,247
Dad, since the epoch of the Qing Dynasty,

15
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,748
the So Cha Ha Yee family

16
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,667
had been nothing but a bunch
of illiterates.

17
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:49,045
But not anymore.
My son, who's your grandson,

18
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,880
knows how to write his own name!

19
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,092
This is truly remarkable, Dad.

20
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,136
Now that he can write,

21
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,971
he will be a scholar one day.

22
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,556
Now that he can write his name,

23
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,391
he will be blessed with a son.

24
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,935
-Young master, you should practice harder.
-Yes, I know.

25
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:06,312
Chan, I think we should mount it.

26
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,439
Sure!

27
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:09,274
Professor, put it up somewhere
everyone can see.

28
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,400
Wait a minute, professor.

29
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,570
Why don't we decorate it in red
and parade it around town?

30
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:14,696
Go!

31
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,282
Chan, sit down with me.

32
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,493
I'm glad to have
a hardworking son like you.

33
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:24,456
Listen to me. You know I've been
the black sheep of the family.

34
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,000
And I've used up almost my entire fortune.

35
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,794
And the worst part is, one day I'll die,

36
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,463
and you will have to fend for yourself.

37
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,006
I'm used to fending for myself.

38
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,257
Here.

39
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,342
Here's a check worth 100,000 taels.
Spend wisely.

40
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,636
Sucker, hand me the imported hat.

41
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:39,804
Where are you going, Chan?

42
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:42,015
I got a birthday party tonight.

43
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,683
How old are you?

44
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,602
I'm turning 25. Don't be late!

45
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,272
At least, you've got to groom yourself
for the occasion.

46
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,899
You look like a beggar!

47
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,401
Can a beggar be that rich?
Then I want to be one!

48
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:57,864
The birthday boy is such a fathead.

49
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:58,907
Come over here.

50
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:00,408
Yes, master?

51
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:03,620
Look at my brat's invitations.
Aren't they pretty?

52
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,664
If I'm having a birthday party,
I got to do better than this!

53
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,145
Your Majesty, what do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

54
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:33,316
For sure, it can't compete
with Beijing Opera.

55
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,319
But it's good to learn about it.

56
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,030
Tips for all.

57
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,115
Tips for all.

58
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,410
Tips for all.

59
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:45,820
Happy birthday, Mr. So.

60
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:48,331
I'm left homeless, poor, and sick.

61
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:52,001
My wife and kids have left me
and I have no one to turn to.

62
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,170
-Do you have alms to spare?
-Damn beggar, are you kidding?

63
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,684
You dirty bastard,
how dare you seek charity here?

64
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,734
I'm going to beat you up--

65
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,657
-Tip him!
-Yes, young master.

66
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,327
Are you kidding?
How could you tip him like that?

67
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:02,536
Hey.

68
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,704
A beggar is just like us.

69
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:05,247
He can come as long as he can afford it.

70
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,375
I'll subsidize your expenses here
for the month, including the hookers!

71
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,586
-All expenses paid?
-Why not?

72
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,464
Sure, of course.

73
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,593
-Come this way.
-Come with me, sir.

74
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:19,853
Mr. So!

75
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,355
Hello.

76
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:22,564
How are you, Madam Pimp?

77
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,983
That's not nice of you to call me that!

78
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,527
We should all be frank, right?

79
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:27,694
You want frank?

80
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,239
You look like a mourner with that hat on.

81
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:31,907
Did your dad die or something?

82
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,327
I'm glad that you talk like that!

83
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:39,665
Mr. Chiu, you helped me wipe out
the Hairy Gang,

84
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,042
so you will receive an award
from the emperor.

85
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,628
I'll appreciate it if you say
something nice

86
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:45,963
in His Majesty's audience.

87
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:49,258
The show is over,
and here are your napkins.

88
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,010
Here.

89
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,763
Mr. So is here!

90
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,432
Mr. So, happy birthday!

91
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,600
This way...

92
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,228
Mr. So, today is your big day,
so you should be happy.

93
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,480
We got you some new girls
just for your pleasure.

94
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,273
Anyone would do. They are all the same.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,482
None of them stands out.

96
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,615
Mr. So, what's the matter?

97
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,241
She licked me.

98
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,952
What? Whoever did that to you,
I'll pull out her tongue--

99
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,996
Not with her tongue, but with her eyes.

100
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,541
I've never seen a glance
so fatally tempting.

101
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,752
May I know who she is?

102
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,962
Yu Shueng is just a substitute.

103
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:31,797
Are you interested in sleeping with her,
Mr. Chiu?

104
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:33,341
You should ask His Majesty first.

105
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,842
How do you like it?

106
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,095
We're just friends,
just go ahead if you want.

107
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,056
Help yourself, Mr. Chiu.

108
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,058
Why, thank you.

109
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,059
Service, please?

110
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,812
Yu Shueng, come down and greet Mr. Chiu!

111
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:52,068
Yu Shueng, he's the one
who killed our dad.

112
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,945
I know, stay calm. Let's go.

113
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,073
Mr. Chiu, Yu Shueng is here.

114
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,537
It's my pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chiu.
I'm Yu Shueng, your lady for tonight.

115
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,502
She's gorgeous.

116
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,131
Mr. Chiu, what are we going to do tonight?

117
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,800
One hundred thousand taels?

118
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,636
If Yu Shueng sleeps with
our young master tonight,

119
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:20,054
you better get lost!

120
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:22,723
Hello! I'm terribly sorry about that,

121
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,183
but I hope you don't mind!

122
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,104
Excuse me. Let me be fair to everyone.

123
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,815
Whoever gets to offer us
more than 100,000 taels

124
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,566
gets to sleep with Yu Shueng.

125
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,528
There's no need to fight over it, okay?

126
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:37,405
What a big spender you are.

127
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:38,698
MONEY

128
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,533
The check looks too simple to me.

129
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:46,247
I have a pearl which is granted
by the royal family. It's invaluable!

130
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,585
I like the pearl more.

131
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:56,132
Mr. Chiu, I'll wait for you in my room.

132
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,676
Is the pearl worth 100,000 taels?

133
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,554
Don't you think it's too little?

134
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:05,057
I like money too, but I don't like you.

135
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,188
She's frank. I really like that!

136
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,273
But Mr. So--

137
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,190
Never mind.

138
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,192
I guess Yu Shueng doesn't like me

139
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,070
because my hat doesn't match my hair,
and I deserved that!

140
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:19,405
Good to know, sir!

141
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:22,033
Relax, there are more pretty girls
you could choose from.

142
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,660
So madam, I'm counting on you tonight!

143
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,165
I didn't do this!

144
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:30,916
How dare you!

145
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,595
A Mantis Fist? Not bad.

146
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:43,971
Music!

147
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:52,521
Hold it!

148
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,399
Crane's Beak, Tiger Claws!

149
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:03,282
Your Mantis Fist is no match
to my Tiger-Crane combo.

150
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,618
I know that combo as much as you do!

151
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,038
Then how about a taste of my Mantis?

152
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,095
Bravo!

153
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,764
Your Tiger-Crane combo is defeated.

154
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,226
That's not Tiger-Crane.

155
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,560
It's a Peacock Spread.

156
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:33,229
That's why it's so weak!

157
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,694
That was fast.

158
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,113
You look pretty tough.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,826
Kid, you don't know how the wind blows.

160
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,209
The General of Canton's here!

161
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,877
Make way!

162
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,173
I'll shoot down whoever picks on my son!

163
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:02,550
-Master.
-Master.

164
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,051
Now, Chan. Who picked on you?

165
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:05,052
No, I picked on someone.

166
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,971
What? You picked on someone?

167
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:09,014
What has he got
that you would pick on him?

168
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,099
Sir, they picked on him.

169
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,184
-Who the hell are you?
-Just take a look at this.

170
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,771
The Iron-Capped Prince?

171
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:20,276
It's a gift! Hey, Chan.

172
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,319
They brought you a gift,
so stop picking on them.

173
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:24,155
-Come on, give these girls some tips.
-But, master,

174
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:27,074
look what's inscribed on it.
"Iron Cap Prince, Sengge Rinchen."

175
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,211
How dare you seize His Majesty's medal?

176
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:42,715
-Arrest him!
-Hold on! According to Qing law,

177
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:45,301
an imperial courtier is forbidden
from engaging with courtesans!

178
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,969
Now, here you are in a brothel.

179
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,637
So you're the one breaking the law!

180
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:50,306
Then what about you?

181
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:51,599
-Who, me?
-Yes, you!

182
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,934
That's right, I'm here to...

183
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:54,894
-to arrest...
-Arrest you.

184
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,604
-Him!
-Arrest him!

185
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,230
As the General of Canton,

186
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:00,774
I'm here to come after
bad apples like you!

187
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:03,527
-By the way--
-What else? Say it!

188
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:07,156
Today is the birthday of
the former Empress Dowager.

189
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:10,451
So your offense goes up one notch
and it could result in capital punishment!

190
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,620
-Off with his head!
-Off with his head!

191
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,542
According to Qing law,

192
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,753
a man who doesn't sport a queue
may be sentenced to death.

193
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:22,379
So you...

194
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,467
Want to see my hair?

195
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:27,927
Be my guest, you jerk.

196
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,929
Cut the crap, just finish him off!

197
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:32,640
Okay, that's enough!

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,017
General So, let's put this to rest
and have some fun.

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,769
Hey, I haven't had fun tonight.

200
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,356
Your Majesty, I didn't think
that they would spoil your fun here.

201
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:41,774
So I'm terribly sorry about that.

202
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,108
You're excused.

203
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:44,735
Let's go.

204
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,241
Sir, you shouldn't have messed with him.
We better leave.

205
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,326
-Okay, we're leaving.
-Yes.

206
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,246
Just put the troubles behind.

207
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,417
Young master, your hat.

208
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:08,300
That's one tough guy.

209
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:20,562
Uncle Mok, the dishes are all poisoned.

210
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,899
Good! Chu Mo Kei plotted against our chief

211
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,485
and some of our generals
in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

212
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,445
And he framed us, the Beggars Sect.

213
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,864
Because of what he did to us,

214
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,491
everyone hates us now.

215
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,702
They say we're imperial lapdogs.

216
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,371
Now, we're going to make him pay
for all this!

217
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,497
-Yes.
-Yes.

218
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,666
They are innately very powerful,

219
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,085
so don't make a move
until he falls into our trap

220
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:45,671
because we're no match against him,
even as a group.

221
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:47,715
I will try my best to seduce him to bed.

222
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,426
Someone's coming.

223
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,844
Get ready.

224
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:01,854
Yu Shueng, we meet again.

225
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:04,023
What brings you here?
And where's Mr. Chiu?

226
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,443
Mr. So crushed Mr. Chiu's pearl
into pearl powder,

227
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:08,944
and I drank it.

228
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,697
Don't judge Mr. So from his hair

229
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,074
because he's actually really manly.

230
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:15,951
-But he--
-That's enough.

231
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:17,745
He paid me 100,000 taels, you know?

232
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,246
And I won't return it.

233
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,248
You know, Mr. So is kind of--

234
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,958
Cut the crap, Madam Pimp!

235
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:23,876
Leave.

236
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes, sir.

237
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,463
-But, Ms. Seven--
-Just bear with him.

238
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:33,260
Who is he?

239
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:34,803
I don't know.

240
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:38,140
First of all, fair maiden,
I have good news for you.

241
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,683
I like you.

242
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,978
Sounds like bad news to me.

243
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:44,980
I knew you would say that.

244
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:48,067
On to my main point.
I would fork out 100 pearls

245
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,694
just so you can keep me company
for the night.

246
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,988
I'm not interested in you. Get out!

247
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,116
I made the right choice!

248
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,285
All right, may I drink this?

249
00:14:58,994 --> 00:14:59,828
No!

250
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,337
That was a huge shocker.

251
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,382
-Miss.
-Hands off!

252
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,510
So you do martial arts?

253
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,388
No, I don't know any of that sort.

254
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,264
I beg you, stop bothering me.

255
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,641
I won't keep you company.

256
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:23,310
Yu Shueng, I've never met someone
who had been this nice to me.

257
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:26,063
I realize that I'm in love with you.

258
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:28,565
What?

259
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:32,194
I said, I'm in love with you.

260
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,863
Are you kidding me?

261
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:37,866
I'm serious. I've decided to marry you.

262
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,411
Are you crazy?

263
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,746
You've got to be kidding!

264
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,084
Someone's hiding around here!

265
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,673
Good, I could use a witness.

266
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:53,841
-A witness?
-Yes.

267
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:56,343
I swear in front of your sword

268
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,887
that I sincerely intend
to marry Yu Shueng,

269
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,848
and if I lied,
may lightning strike me to death.

270
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,059
I'm so happy for you, Yu Shueng.

271
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:04,977
Hey!

272
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:08,313
You think it's easy being my husband?

273
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,190
Then how do I become your husband?

274
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:15,154
I want a martial arts champion
who's second to no one on Earth!

275
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,280
Can you do that?

276
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,115
Let me think.

277
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:25,497
Yes, I can.

278
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,211
Okay. Come back to me
once you've achieved that.

279
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:35,048
Well, I think we should set a date
for our wedding

280
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,093
because as a scholar,
martial arts is too easy for me!

281
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:42,347
Okay, but you better give me some time
to consider this.

282
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:45,350
No problem, I will wait for your response
outside the garden.

283
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:47,186
See you.

284
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,733
-Pervert.
-Pervert.

285
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:18,717
Only members of the Beggars Sect
are authorized to pass!

286
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:18,110
Sir, it's been 15 minutes.
We're right on time.

287
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,529
The coast is clear. We may pass.

288
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,658
Good, very good.

289
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:27,953
Let's move!

290
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,093
Damn, we're too late!

291
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,637
He stood in our way.

292
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,522
-Yu Shueng?
-What is it?

293
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:57,065
That jerk is still here.

294
00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:58,734
Let's get rid of him.

295
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,028
Leave it. He means us no harm.

296
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:02,446
Let him go.

297
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,043
Do you like him somehow?

298
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:17,878
What did you say?

299
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:21,423
I won't fall in love with anybody
until we get rid of Chiu.

300
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:22,758
Especially him.

301
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,260
Chiu is good at martial arts.

302
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:28,764
Uncle Mok said we can only defeat him
with the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

303
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:30,891
Guess I won't be married after all.

304
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,602
Let's go if you want to marry.

305
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,904
Who the hell are you?
How dare you scare me like that?

306
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,866
Mr. So, it's me, your Madam Pimp.

307
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,388
Stop waiting for Yu Shueng,
she has gone out now.

308
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,919
She is going to Beijing.

309
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,015
Beijing?

310
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:11,520
Men should contribute to the country

311
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:15,441
I've got no place to hang my pigtail

312
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,693
Swing and swing!

313
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,862
I pull it and play with it...

314
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:21,030
Dad!

315
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,491
I want to join the Martial Arts Contest.

316
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,034
Chan,

317
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,620
I've waited 25 years to hear you
utter those words.

318
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:29,455
Now, do our family proud!

319
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:31,791
Don't look at it that way.
I'm not doing it for anyone

320
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:32,708
except for one lady.

321
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:33,834
You hero!

322
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,587
You want to be a martial arts champion
just for a lady?

323
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:37,671
Who's that lady?

324
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,965
Her name is Yu Shueng,
and she's from the Yee Hung Brothel.

325
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:41,300
She's a whore?

326
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:43,594
What's wrong with that?

327
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,264
You have such exquisite taste!

328
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:48,599
You deserve my praise.

329
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,600
I'll take you there!

330
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,976
Two, three, four, five, six!

331
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,229
Coming!

332
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:56,148
Chan is going for the contest in Beijing,
so let's all move there!

333
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,318
Stop chasing the chickens!

334
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:01,987
We won't be taking them along.
There's plenty in the capital.

335
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:05,157
Be careful!

336
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:08,077
Whoever breaks my property
is going to get it from me!

337
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,578
Be careful!

338
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:11,705
-Good morning, Dad.
-Good morning.

339
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:13,582
-You're going to move all of them?
-Of course!

340
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,376
Could you give me something to wear?

341
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,420
You are only a kid, you don't need it.

342
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:18,587
I'm not little anymore!

343
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,550
So yours is bigger than mine?

344
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,136
-Are you teasing me?
-Sooner or later, it would be.

345
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,847
Could anyone give me a pair of pants
or something?

346
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,056
Don't look!

347
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:32,143
Don't just stand there, take it away!

348
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:34,937
This house is so big for us to move.

349
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,772
Spare no effort, everyone!

350
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:40,317
Ready, one, two, three, push!

351
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:44,196
Push!

352
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,865
Be careful!

353
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,658
Tie it up nicely.

354
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,368
Do you want to move the tree too, sir?

355
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,286
Of course!

356
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,413
Or I won't be able to eat
lychee in Beijing.

357
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:54,415
Push it over.

358
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:58,836
Be careful now. Look out for the fruits!

359
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,422
Take good care of my lychee tree,
you idiots!

360
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,675
Chu Mo Kei has assisted me

361
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:08,846
in executing a crackdown against
the Hairy Gang in Guangxi.

362
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,724
Therefore I present him
to Your Majesty's audience.

363
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,688
Good. I shall appoint you to be my Deputy
Left Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate.

364
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,067
May you serve the Qing Empire dutifully.

365
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:23,777
Thank you, Your Majesty.

366
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:27,323
Your Majesty,
Mr. Chiu is a brilliant magician.

367
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:30,451
Why don't you ask him
to show you something?

368
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:31,619
Magic?

369
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,916
Mr. Chiu, show me your magic.

370
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,417
Yes.

371
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:55,179
It's nothing. Dismissed!

372
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,263
-Hey!
-Hey!

373
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,315
LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR

374
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,529
My heartfelt apologies
if it had frightened you.

375
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,324
If only the woman was real.

376
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:18,494
Hurry!

377
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:21,830
What is it?

378
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,290
Come on, go in.

379
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:27,503
What is it?

380
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:28,921
Hide inside.

381
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:32,925
Ready, young master?

382
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:34,676
Come on.

383
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,679
Now everyone, stand still.

384
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,104
Such a sweet smell. Are you Piu Hung?

385
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:48,023
Wow, you're so clever!

386
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:49,900
Come closer.

387
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:53,362
You're so tall. You must be Shorty?

388
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:57,491
-Don't call me that!
-You are indeed tall.

389
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:02,454
Is that a baby bump? You can't fool me.

390
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:03,539
It's you, Dad!

391
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:07,042
Damn it, you got me!

392
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,460
That's my boy.

393
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:12,131
I wanted to trick you actually,
but you were brilliant.

394
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:16,343
That's it, folks.
Chan has a contest tomorrow.

395
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:18,345
Stop playing now. You're dismissed.

396
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:22,683
Chan, have you prepared
for tomorrow's contest?

397
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:25,394
What should I prepare?
I'll surely pass, you know?

398
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,271
Of course!

399
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:30,232
I feel assured just by looking at you.

400
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:32,818
Chan, meet Cheng Sai Pak.

401
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,571
He will be your examiner. Say hello.

402
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:38,449
Mr. Cheng, how thoughtless of me!

403
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:45,205
See? My son looks like a champion,
doesn't he?

404
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,583
That's if he's lucky.

405
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,794
Cheng, I've asked someone

406
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,296
to deal with the papers you gave me.

407
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,422
Are you going to rig them?

408
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,632
The papers are the least of your concern.

409
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,509
But when it comes to archery,

410
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,261
equestrian, weightlifting,
boxing, and weaponry,

411
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:00,387
it's all up to him.

412
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:01,430
Don't worry.

413
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,391
My son is proficient in all fields
of martial arts.

414
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,227
But could you consider giving me
a two-million tael deduction?

415
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:09,730
We may be friends, but this is business.

416
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:21,200
I would present an echelon formation,
with the cavalry in the lead,

417
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,702
the archers on the sides,
and the artillery at the back.

418
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:55,234
MARTIAL ARTS EXAMINATION

419
00:27:55,317 --> 00:28:00,656
Candidates of the Martial Arts Preliminary
Examination, please come forward!

420
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:04,952
HEBEI

421
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:06,912
GUANGDONG

422
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:11,792
MONGOLIA

423
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:15,712
ZHEJIANG

424
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,630
JIANGSU

425
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,726
FAILED

426
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,234
FAILED

427
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:55,754
I can't lift it.

428
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:57,839
SHAMELESS

429
00:28:58,715 --> 00:28:59,841
I don't want to waste my energy.

430
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:01,500
Shameless? Damn you.

431
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:29,382
Oh, ten points!

432
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:45,565
TEN POINTS

433
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,802
The Martial Arts Exam finals begin now!

434
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,305
The candidates are

435
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,849
-Botaroto from Mongolia...
-Bravo!

436
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,980
and So Cha Ha Yee Chan from Guangdong.

437
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,318
Last call.

438
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,654
So Cha Ha Yee Chan, one to ten.
Botaroto, one to one.

439
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:20,700
You've got to be kidding me!
That's a big difference.

440
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,411
One is one to ten
and the other one to one.

441
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:25,413
Why is there no faith in my boy?

442
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:29,751
Of course.
Chan forfeited in weightlifting.

443
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:33,171
Look at Botaroto

444
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,882
with a full score, so it's different.

445
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:39,344
He's in a contest, not hard labor.

446
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:41,262
What's the point of weightlifting?

447
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,056
-You shouldn't put it that way.
-What?

448
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,016
Our colleague here is experienced,
you know?

449
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,895
I studied the contest long enough,
and I don't quite agree with the odds.

450
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:53,191
Botaroto may look fit and vigorous,

451
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:56,110
but he's sweating all around his neck
before he even competes.

452
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,404
-I suspect he's overheated.
-Is it?

453
00:31:58,488 --> 00:31:59,364
Really?

454
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:02,408
-As for So Cha Ha Yee Chan--
-What do you think?

455
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:04,202
He may have let down the spectators,

456
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,871
but he's worked his ass off
to reach this level.

457
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:08,665
Excuse me?

458
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:11,834
I mean, he has the spirit to fight on.

459
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,546
So I want to place all my bets on him.

460
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:16,965
How much do you want to bet?

461
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,383
Eight hundred thousand taels.

462
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:21,386
Just eight hundred thousand taels?
Why not two million?

463
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:23,388
Why are you so optimistic about Chan?

464
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,181
I think you're great at analyzing.

465
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,017
You know what?
I think So Chan will surely win this one.

466
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:30,728
Come here.

467
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,189
-I want to bet more on him.
-Really?

468
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:34,399
Two million taels!

469
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,401
That's the spirit!

470
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:38,861
Why don't you bet?

471
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:41,406
Why should I bet? He's my son.

472
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:45,702
Shit! I missed one factor
out of my calculation.

473
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:46,953
What did you leave out?

474
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:48,121
The bloodlines.

475
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,250
The examiners have arrived!

476
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,421
Wait, isn't Cheng the examiner?

477
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:01,426
Take your seats, please.

478
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,638
Sengge Rinchen?

479
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,181
What's up with that?

480
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:10,560
He's Botaroto's uncle.

481
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:14,022
Shall we begin?

482
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,944
Begin!

483
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:55,980
They should give him extra two points
for that powerful shot.

484
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:57,899
Yes, I second that.

485
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:04,489
So's arrow wasn't right on target.
Botaroto won this round.

486
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,706
What the hell? Are they trying to cheat?

487
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:20,505
Candidates, on your horses!

488
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:24,300
Mr. Chiu.

489
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:31,349
Take these with you.
You may find them useful.

490
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,435
Round two begins now!

491
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,008
They are cheating us again!

492
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:09,846
They fixed the match!
Can I withdraw my bets?

493
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,705
Chan won this round!

494
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:37,540
Did you rip the ticket?

495
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:39,167
No, I didn't.

496
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:53,222
Are you kidding me?

497
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,661
Not giving up? Bring it on!

498
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,418
Okay, let's start over.
I'll go easy on you.

499
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:05,837
So you can't complain!

500
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,683
Trying to pull a dirty trick?

501
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:20,476
Serves you right, sucker!

502
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:22,687
Hooray, he did it!

503
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:24,689
This calls for some tea!

504
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:28,909
All what? Excuse me?

505
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,577
It's in English.

506
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:31,787
Of course, it is!

507
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,080
There is no prohibition on weapons.

508
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,709
You fell down first,
so Botaroto won again!

509
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,645
Damn you, Cheng!
You turned your back on me!

510
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:47,636
I will beat you to death
if I see you again!

511
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,513
Forget it, you won't see him anymore.

512
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:50,430
Why?

513
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:52,432
I want to kill him now
so I won't lose my two million!

514
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:55,602
Just kidding.

515
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:56,812
You're shameless.

516
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,168
By winning two of three rounds,
Botaroto is our martial arts champion!

517
00:37:57,702 --> 00:37:59,871
Hey, I won. I object!

518
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:18,556
What happened?

519
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:22,560
The dart... it's poisoned.

520
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,564
Serves you right!

521
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,819
His own dart poisoned him!

522
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,114
Now, my son gets the championship!

523
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,991
-And I am going to be rich!
-Yes!

524
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:38,701
Why you...

525
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,378
Praise be to my ancestors.

526
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,671
You have good taste.

527
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:54,551
Sir, His Majesty wants to bestow
the title himself.

528
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:58,805
Then be it.

529
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:06,437
Mr. Champion, we would like to ask you
a few questions for the imperial record.

530
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:09,315
Who do you thank for your victory?

531
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,483
Yu Shueng!

532
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:14,737
-Who's Yu Shueng?
-Is that his mother?

533
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,995
-Long live the emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

534
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:24,539
-Get up.
-As you wish!

535
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:28,918
So who is our new martial arts champion?

536
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:34,340
He goes by the name So Chan
from Guangdong, Your Majesty.

537
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:39,596
So Cha Ha Yee Chan at your service,
Your Majesty.

538
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,975
Your Majesty,
I would like to report something.

539
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:47,604
Go ahead.

540
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:51,524
I've discovered that So is illiterate

541
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:53,484
so he couldn't possibly answer
the strategy paper.

542
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:54,444
He must have cheated.

543
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:00,241
Bring him the stationery.

544
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,242
Yes!

545
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:09,584
So Cha Ha Yee Chan, write your name now.

546
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,213
Thank heavens, he now knows
how to write his name!

547
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:15,798
He can write his name!

548
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,063
I can't write.

549
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,316
You were clearly cheating.

550
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,026
Take him away to be executed!

551
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:36,736
Please, no!

552
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,573
Your Majesty, I was the one who cheated.

553
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:42,408
My son did nothing.
Just execute me if you have to.

554
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:43,618
No, I should be executed!

555
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:45,662
Sorry, Dad. I can't write my name.

556
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:47,288
Yes, I knew it already.

557
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:48,414
I should be executed.

558
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:49,582
-Execute me.
-No, execute me.

559
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,459
-Kill me.
-No, Your Majesty, you better kill me.

560
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,920
Scoundrels! Are you both commanding me?

561
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:56,005
I'm holding you both for collusion.

562
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,216
Secretary of Appointments,
what's their penalty?

563
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:02,553
Secretary of Appointments, where are you?
Come out now!

564
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,639
At your service!

565
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:09,977
He's the Secretary of Appointments?

566
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:14,524
So Chan and his father are liable
to be executed for cheating His Majesty.

567
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:19,070
But due to the family's outstanding
service, their lives will be spared.

568
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:22,532
Instead, we will seize their property
for corruption and...

569
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:24,200
Were you in law enforcement?

570
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:27,036
No, I haven't reported myself for duty
in seven years.

571
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:30,665
So he didn't commit
any miscarriage of duty.

572
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,712
Your Majesty, I suggest that we do no more
than confiscate their property.

573
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:41,426
What? Why are you so lenient?

574
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,594
I'm just being fair.

575
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:46,013
I'm basing my judgment on the basic law.

576
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:49,142
Can we be a little tougher on them?

577
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,687
Yes, sire. You're the Emperor after all.

578
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:55,857
I want them to be beggars
for the rest of their lives!

579
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:57,316
Sengge Rinchen,

580
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:58,901
why didn't you report his cheating?

581
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:00,445
Good thing we have Chu Mo Kei.

582
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:03,531
Mr. Chiu, you deserve a reward
for uncovering the scandal.

583
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:10,037
I'm going with the flow...

584
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:12,582
Don't touch my father's ancestral tablet!

585
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,127
What do you need that incense burner for?

586
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,258
With the times

587
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:26,679
A pair of lovebirds

588
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:30,850
Are not meant to part

589
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,977
So I just--

590
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,145
Young master.

591
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:37,940
From now on,
you must work on your writing skills.

592
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:48,785
So I just can't stop yearning for you

593
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,581
Professor.

594
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:55,750
I'll learn.

595
00:42:56,709 --> 00:43:00,087
I shouldn't regret...

596
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:05,092
Master, I promise I'll take good care
of your turtle.

597
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,511
I am sorry, master.

598
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:09,013
We failed to bear you any children
for all the years together.

599
00:43:09,305 --> 00:43:10,389
It's okay.

600
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:12,350
That was all my fault.

601
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:15,186
If I did better,
you would've borne more babies.

602
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:18,064
But I think I'm good with Chan.

603
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,733
Don't just stand here. Go.

604
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:23,569
-Farewell, master.
-Farewell, master.

605
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:24,821
Godspeed.

606
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:28,533
We're free!

607
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:30,660
I'm overjoyed!

608
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:34,664
Such a joyous occasion!

609
00:43:35,665 --> 00:43:36,541
In we go!

610
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:37,667
Hurry...

611
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:39,085
What the--

612
00:43:40,086 --> 00:43:41,796
What is he laughing about?
He's being evicted.

613
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:42,797
Is that so?

614
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:45,675
It's so hilarious...

615
00:43:46,175 --> 00:43:48,511
Welcome, please come in!

616
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:52,473
Damn, we're being evicted.
I feel like crying, my boy!

617
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,517
No, we got to preserve our dignity.

618
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:55,685
Keep on laughing!

619
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,690
Son, have you kept any money for yourself?

620
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:01,983
No, how about you?

621
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:03,693
I forgot.

622
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:09,699
-Damn, we're all done for!
-Damn, we're all done for!

623
00:44:11,534 --> 00:44:16,581
Spare us some alms, kind sir...

624
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:19,542
Son, do you think he's like me?

625
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:21,377
The chanting one?

626
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:23,754
-No, I meant the alms giver!
-Hey!

627
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:25,923
He's more presumptuous
than the chanting beggar.

628
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,968
No, I say he's rather dashing.
Everyone's different.

629
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:31,387
This is all my fault!

630
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,639
I kept calling you beggar all the time.

631
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:34,599
And now we've become one.

632
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:35,641
I'm not resigning to this.

633
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:38,728
Do we have to be beggars
just because the emperor told us to?

634
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:40,730
I'm talented and skilled in martial arts.

635
00:44:41,147 --> 00:44:42,690
Even the gods won't let me be a beggar!

636
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:44,525
-That's right.
-Do I look like a beggar?

637
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:47,486
-No!
-Have some food money, you beggars.

638
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,408
Hey, did you just call us beggars?

639
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:54,660
Damn you, old lady!

640
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:56,746
Outrageous! Let's find something to eat.

641
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:02,418
Chan, since we have nothing to do,

642
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:05,171
let me find us a seat so we may
be able to dine tonight.

643
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:06,881
So you call yourself a beggar?

644
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:08,549
Don't worry, Dad.

645
00:45:08,716 --> 00:45:10,217
We don't have to beg for money.

646
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:11,510
Then how do we get money?

647
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:12,511
Just ask for it decently!

648
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:14,347
Excuse me, sir. May I know your name?

649
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:17,475
-I'm Nau Tai Chung.
-Do you have money?

650
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,060
-Yes.
-Can I have some of it?

651
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:20,019
Sure!

652
00:45:24,523 --> 00:45:25,733
-Thanks.
-Hey!

653
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,526
Why should I give you money?

654
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:29,153
Why do you ask so much?

655
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:30,696
I deserve to know why!

656
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:32,990
I don't care, I want the money.

657
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:35,034
No, I demand an explanation.

658
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:38,454
Stop asking and start giving!

659
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:39,497
Hands off!

660
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,456
Are you robbing me?

661
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,708
Help, I'm being robbed!

662
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,086
No, we're not robbing him.
We're just begging.

663
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:48,714
You're begging?
How dare you trick me like that?

664
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:51,801
Are you taking me for a fool?
I'm smarter than you think!

665
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:52,968
It's been two days now.

666
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:55,054
It's getting cold, and I'm starving.

667
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:56,764
Do you have any idea?

668
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,656
Yes. My friend's stepmother has a sister

669
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:00,991
who happens to live in Beijing.

670
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:04,077
And she once told me she admired you.

671
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:05,287
Really?

672
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,164
Yes, if you are willing to date her.

673
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,709
She may help us get back to Canton.

674
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:13,128
But you have to sacrifice.

675
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:14,963
-Here it goes.
-Do you mean...

676
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,424
I'll do anything for our sake.

677
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:18,717
It's going to be hard.

678
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,218
Enough, let's go find her!

679
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:21,469
I have arranged it.

680
00:46:22,095 --> 00:46:24,639
She will come out under the lantern
wearing a red dress.

681
00:46:30,895 --> 00:46:32,022
It's a ghost!

682
00:46:36,943 --> 00:46:37,986
There he is.

683
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:40,488
Then I'm leaving this to you!

684
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:57,297
Chan, I haven't tried this before.
Be careful!

685
00:46:57,464 --> 00:46:59,424
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

686
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,176
You want to earn big, right?

687
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:02,510
Right...

688
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:07,265
Make way!

689
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:08,683
No street performances allowed!

690
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:15,440
Sir, we just want to earn some money
to go back to Canton.

691
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,401
So if you could please show us some mercy?

692
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:21,571
The emperor ordered

693
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,407
that So Cha Ha Yee Chan and his father
be beggars for life.

694
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,493
And you may do no more than that.

695
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,162
I'm just performing my duties. Men!

696
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,747
-Yes, sir!
-Seize their belongings!

697
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,790
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

698
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:35,669
Help!

699
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:37,921
Master Chiu, I can't carry this by myself!

700
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,715
Then could the rest help him?

701
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,800
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

702
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:45,011
What do you want?

703
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,638
-We can't move it!
-Let me try!

704
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,139
You want to fight me?

705
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:50,809
You may have gotten away
at the Yee Hung Brothel,

706
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:52,811
but you won't be so lucky this time.

707
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,439
This one is not a piece of cake.

708
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,442
I have to defeat him in a single blow

709
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:01,194
without letting him counterattack.

710
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:26,845
Chan!

711
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,222
Chan!

712
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:32,392
-I've crippled all your arms and legs.
-Chan!

713
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:35,270
And this is how you will live out
your days!

714
00:48:37,397 --> 00:48:39,858
You want to fight? Forget it!

715
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,820
At least, you can still beg for money.

716
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:45,530
Let's move!

717
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:50,535
-Make way!
-Make way!

718
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:03,047
Hang on, Chan. You're going to be fine.

719
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:08,720
Hang on, Chan. You're going to be fine.

720
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,764
Hang on.

721
00:49:11,973 --> 00:49:15,643
On that day,
my son and I went to the contest venue,

722
00:49:15,894 --> 00:49:17,520
and then I met this examiner.

723
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,647
Could you guess who he was?

724
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:22,734
It's that bastard Sengge Rinchen!

725
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:25,945
I can't remember what we did wrong to him.

726
00:49:26,237 --> 00:49:27,781
It makes me mad when I hear his name!

727
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,324
Let's take a smoke break.

728
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:31,618
You could use a smoke now.

729
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:34,245
-Yes!
-I second that.

730
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:38,082
We dueled him at the Yee Hung Brothel,

731
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,126
but we let him off in the end,

732
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,170
not thinking he would then bite us back.

733
00:49:42,337 --> 00:49:44,339
He set up my son

734
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,674
by tampering with the equipment.

735
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:49,886
Fortunately, my son was smart enough
to outwit him.

736
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:52,680
I want a martial arts champion

737
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,933
who's second to no one on Earth!

738
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:56,518
Can you do that?

739
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:57,519
Yes, I can.

740
00:49:57,602 --> 00:49:58,436
Okay.

741
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:01,606
Come back to me once you've achieved that.

742
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:05,068
Well, I think we should set a date
for our wedding

743
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:08,196
because as a scholar,
martial arts is too easy for me!

744
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:18,998
Write your name!

745
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,794
I can't write.

746
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,807
Chan, are you all right?

747
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,436
Was it another nightmare?

748
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:43,356
Don't think so much.

749
00:50:44,399 --> 00:50:47,110
Here.

750
00:50:50,154 --> 00:50:53,241
It's been two months now.
You should be able to move.

751
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,827
-But your limbs haven't fully recovered.
-Mr. Ha Yee?

752
00:50:55,994 --> 00:50:57,912
I'm coming!

753
00:50:58,454 --> 00:51:01,124
I am going out to beg for food.

754
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:04,252
Then I'll make you herbal tea
for one last time.

755
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,421
Dad, are you going begging again?

756
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:08,923
Just leave that to your old man.

757
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:10,466
You are still my champion.

758
00:51:13,177 --> 00:51:16,973
Chan, it's hard to be a beggar.

759
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,892
You got to know the tricks of the trade.

760
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,978
You don't just show your hand
and beg for money.

761
00:51:22,186 --> 00:51:24,689
You need at least a bowl
as a status marker.

762
00:51:24,772 --> 00:51:27,483
Even beggars are divided into class.
What bullshit!

763
00:51:27,901 --> 00:51:29,777
Hurry up!

764
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:32,864
I am coming!

765
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:34,699
We will miss our food if we're late!

766
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:35,617
I'm coming...

767
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,952
You think you're still the general
you used to be?

768
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:56,846
Could you spare me some money?

769
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,476
-I'm sorry, I don't have any!
-Go away, don't disrupt my business!

770
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:06,022
Got to go, Chan!

771
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:21,454
Thank you.

772
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:30,004
Thank you.

773
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:38,805
Do you mind?

774
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:39,722
Write it yourself!

775
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:42,809
You're off duty.
Can I borrow it for a while?

776
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:44,644
Are you taking me for a fool?

777
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,430
Dad!

778
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:23,224
What?

779
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:27,145
I feel so freaking cold, Chan.

780
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,942
No, you're burning hot.

781
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:36,320
-Are you sick?
-No, I'm not.

782
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,322
It's late.

783
00:53:39,323 --> 00:53:41,075
I've got to go beg for food.

784
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:45,163
Stay here. I'll take over for today.

785
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,040
You're going begging?

786
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,709
No, I'm going to find it my way.

787
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:50,752
Now, rest.

788
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,712
I'll take you to the doctor
once I get some money.

789
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,067
You little brat, why won't you eat?

790
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:16,486
You should eat more
so you would be strong.

791
00:54:18,946 --> 00:54:20,073
Finish it.

792
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:24,368
-No, I am full.
-You should take all the food.

793
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,205
Never mind, let's go home.

794
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:31,417
Come on, eat it all! Finish it!

795
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:35,838
-Young man.
-What?

796
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:37,715
-Could you--
-No!

797
00:54:56,192 --> 00:55:02,448
Show me some mercy!
And you will be blessed!

798
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:10,039
Why won't you show pity
to this lowly beggar?

799
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,418
My father is dying.

800
00:55:16,337 --> 00:55:18,339
Would you like some carbon, Mr. Beggar?

801
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:19,757
Oh, thank you!

802
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,301
Could you give me some coins?

803
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,429
It's you!

804
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:26,472
I think you're mistaken.

805
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:28,599
Yu Shueng, it's him!

806
00:55:28,683 --> 00:55:29,600
No...

807
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:31,769
Yu Shueng, it's So Chan!

808
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,647
-Hey!
-Hey!

809
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:36,023
Wait!

810
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:42,655
Miss, who are you looking for?

811
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:46,784
I'm sorry, I was mistaken.

812
00:55:47,034 --> 00:55:48,786
Tsui, bring him some dumplings.

813
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,289
You're mistaken, he's not So Chan.

814
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,958
You look like someone I know.

815
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:57,295
Come here for some dumplings
if you can't find anything to eat.

816
00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:00,047
We always leave leftovers.

817
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,717
-Here are the dumplings.
-Take them.

818
00:56:06,888 --> 00:56:08,097
Thank you.

819
00:56:11,225 --> 00:56:12,059
Yu Shueng,

820
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:14,770
he wouldn't be so poor
if it weren't for you.

821
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,578
Dad, what did you do?

822
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:33,539
I was starving to death!

823
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,918
Then I saw a kid with some dumplings
and took a little bite.

824
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:39,045
I brought you some. Give them back.

825
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:42,465
That's like saying I can cut off your head
and give it back to you!

826
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:46,177
Aren't you the champion?

827
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:50,223
Hey, it's really you, right?

828
00:56:51,682 --> 00:56:54,268
-Almost--
-Guys, it's really him!

829
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:56,521
-Let's be nice to him, okay?
-It's him.

830
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,022
Thank you.

831
00:56:58,105 --> 00:57:00,358
Wait a minute! We just happened to meet.

832
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:06,364
He's right, we happened to meet.
Perhaps they will treat us a meal.

833
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:10,868
Here's the dog food.

834
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:15,122
Mr. Champion, I'll let your father go
if you can have some dog food.

835
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,377
It's really dog food.

836
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:20,795
What's the matter?

837
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:22,547
Just eat it.

838
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:34,600
Chan, don't eat that!

839
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,269
Or you will fall from grace!

840
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:39,063
Just leave me behind.

841
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:42,358
Please, sir!
I was the General of Canton...

842
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:45,570
-What the hell?
-Stop fighting!

843
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:46,862
Stand still.

844
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:55,913
A martial arts champion
is eating dog food!

845
00:57:55,997 --> 00:57:58,833
Dad, it's quite delicious.

846
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:03,296
Then why don't I try some?

847
00:58:08,509 --> 00:58:10,136
It's delicious, isn't it?

848
00:58:14,765 --> 00:58:16,225
Dad, look!

849
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:18,185
I found a pork shred.

850
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,521
It's not a shred, it's pork chop!

851
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:32,450
You're as hungry as dogs.

852
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:34,452
You can enjoy dog food all your life!

853
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:39,081
Don't stop. Finish it.

854
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:41,250
It's delicious.

855
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:43,210
I would like to keep it
as a midnight snack.

856
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:45,004
That's very clever of you!

857
00:58:45,379 --> 00:58:47,089
You deserve to be beggars!

858
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,135
While the champion is eating dog food,

859
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:54,430
-let's go get us some decent chow!
-Let's go!

860
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:59,310
Mr. So!

861
00:59:04,523 --> 00:59:05,691
And you are?

862
00:59:06,317 --> 00:59:08,027
My father was chief of the Beggars Sect.

863
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,613
So I thought I would like you to join us.

864
00:59:10,946 --> 00:59:12,365
I hope you don't mind, sir.

865
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:14,909
Sure. You mean, it's a beggars club?

866
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:18,079
-Yes.
-Good! We happen to be beggars now.

867
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:19,789
We got someone to take care of us.

868
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:21,749
Chan... Where did that brat go?

869
00:59:21,832 --> 00:59:24,919
-Where's Chan? Where did he go?
-Okay, you can count us in!

870
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:25,836
Chan?

871
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,046
Chan!

872
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:42,019
-Happy New Year, Yu Shueng!
-Happy New Year!

873
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:44,355
-Happy New Year, Uncle Mok!
-Happy New Year!

874
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,898
This is for you.

875
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,400
Thank you.

876
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:52,113
A set of clothes for you
and another for Chan.

877
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,281
Thank you. Put it down first.

878
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,493
-Do you have any coins?
-Yes.

879
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,328
-Give them to me, come on.
-What for?

880
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:03,666
It's the new year,
so you deserve some red packets.

881
01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:05,626
Here, I wish you good health!

882
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,586
Have a wonderful year ahead!

883
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,880
-Thank you.
-Uncle Mok, we're too old for that!

884
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:10,965
How about Chan?

885
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:16,053
Chan? He hasn't been awake
since last night.

886
01:00:16,137 --> 01:00:17,221
He's still tucked in bed.

887
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:19,557
He just got to bed! Don't wake him up.

888
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:21,851
I will make you some new year cakes.

889
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:24,895
Let me help you out.

890
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,232
How can he sleep through New Year's Day?

891
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:31,485
That good-for-nothing.

892
01:00:34,155 --> 01:00:35,406
Is everyone here?

893
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:39,368
The Beggars Sect must unite
to bring down Chu Mo Kei.

894
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,997
Therefore we need to elect a new head
to lead us all.

895
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:45,958
Yu Shueng.

896
01:00:47,168 --> 01:00:49,128
It's all up to you to defeat
the Three Elders

897
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:50,337
and their Lotus Formation.

898
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:53,924
But I don't think I'm good enough.

899
01:00:54,258 --> 01:00:56,343
Judging from
my Dog-Beating Staff skills now,

900
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:59,054
I doubt that I could fare well
against the Three Elders.

901
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:03,893
Take this Great Elixir Pill.
It will give you a major boost.

902
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:07,521
No, this is all we have to cure
your internal injuries.

903
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:08,564
I can't take this.

904
01:01:08,814 --> 01:01:10,441
Don't worry!

905
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,485
You can ask my son to fight
on your behalf.

906
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,279
He's a martial arts champion, and now...

907
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:16,280
Oh, no. He used to be one!

908
01:01:16,363 --> 01:01:17,823
Look at him, he's so lazy.

909
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,992
He does nothing but sleep.

910
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:22,119
He's not even cut out to be a beggar!

911
01:01:22,203 --> 01:01:23,954
Don't be so frank, okay?

912
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:26,707
And could you please keep it down?

913
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:40,054
Chan, no matter how much
they look down on you,

914
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:43,432
I have faith in you.

915
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,477
Even though you don't fight anymore,

916
01:01:47,144 --> 01:01:48,604
as long as you remember the basics,

917
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,564
and you put on some extra effort,

918
01:01:50,648 --> 01:01:52,316
you can achieve something.

919
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,652
But I am weak now.
I don't want to fight anymore.

920
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:55,986
Don't tell me you're so weak!

921
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:57,363
Come on, punch me!

922
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:02,743
See, that was a strong one!

923
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,662
Like I said, to become someone...

924
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,664
Never mind, let's not waste time.

925
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,332
Could you let me doze off a little longer?

926
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,297
Why did you lock me up?

927
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:16,632
Enjoy your sleep!

928
01:02:31,188 --> 01:02:35,025
Son, I racked my brains just to come up
with this contraption.

929
01:02:35,609 --> 01:02:38,612
Now, you better work hard and brush up
your Dog-Beating Staff skills!

930
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:02,636
Hey. What are you doing up there?

931
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:05,306
You said to practice Dog-Beating Staff.

932
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,850
Could you at least give me a staff?

933
01:03:09,226 --> 01:03:11,395
Oh, I'm so sorry! Take this!

934
01:03:19,486 --> 01:03:22,323
"When Heaven has a mission for you,

935
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:27,828
it will exercise your mind with labor,
starvation, and suffering."

936
01:03:34,752 --> 01:03:37,504
"Endless suffering." Did you write it?

937
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:43,427
I don't like to see that.
You better rub it off.

938
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:46,180
Hey.

939
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,848
-Are you a beggar?
-Yes.

940
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:49,266
Me too.

941
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:50,309
Congratulations.

942
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:53,729
-Got any food?
-No.

943
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:55,898
Luckily, I do.

944
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:05,699
It's a waste that you're well-dressed
but you're not out there begging.

945
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:07,368
It's none of your business.

946
01:04:08,452 --> 01:04:10,037
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

947
01:04:10,204 --> 01:04:11,872
No wonder your pals hate you.

948
01:04:13,874 --> 01:04:15,668
I was once dignified wherever I went.

949
01:04:16,126 --> 01:04:17,252
But now, I am disgraced.

950
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:19,713
At least, you were fortunate.

951
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,924
As for me, no one even respected me!

952
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:25,302
Listen to me. Don't go!

953
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:29,932
I remember the time
when I lived in Guangdong,

954
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,018
someone treated me to wine and dine
and hook up with girls.

955
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,561
What a weird man.

956
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:39,024
Hey, I remember you.

957
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:42,903
-Brat, I remember you too!
-Cut the crap.

958
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:44,530
Give me back my money!

959
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:46,156
If I had money,

960
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:48,367
I wouldn't be a beggar now!

961
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:54,915
But don't worry, I owe you my gratitude.

962
01:04:55,082 --> 01:04:56,834
I will repay you one day.

963
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,420
Thank you very much.

964
01:05:00,754 --> 01:05:02,381
But even if you're rich again,

965
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:04,091
you can't buy back what you've lost!

966
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:06,635
What did I lose?

967
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,054
Pride and faith.

968
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:10,848
And your loved one too.

969
01:05:13,434 --> 01:05:14,393
Who are you?

970
01:05:14,852 --> 01:05:18,897
I am Hung Yat Sun,
also going by Old Bag Sun.

971
01:05:19,106 --> 01:05:22,276
I am the most senior of the beggars here.

972
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:23,777
It's good to be a beggar.

973
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:25,946
Beggars can do whatever they want.

974
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,197
But what about you?

975
01:05:27,364 --> 01:05:30,075
Tell me, what do you want?
I'll make your wish come true.

976
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:31,326
I want to be a man again.

977
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,245
Don't you think you're a man now?

978
01:05:34,621 --> 01:05:35,956
I guess not.

979
01:05:36,123 --> 01:05:38,417
That's why you end up like this.

980
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:43,172
Excellent.

981
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,593
I'm not going to lie to you, but overall,

982
01:05:47,676 --> 01:05:49,928
you just look like a beggar
from head to foot.

983
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:52,890
-So?
-That means,

984
01:05:52,973 --> 01:05:54,767
you will be a beggar for life.

985
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,813
I don't want to talk to you,
I want to sleep first.

986
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:02,441
Don't go! You can rise again.

987
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:03,776
If you ask what I think,

988
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,402
I say you will be the king of beggars.

989
01:06:05,903 --> 01:06:08,489
What do you mean,
I'll be the king of beggars?

990
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:11,033
You will be a beggar.

991
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,331
I don't care who you are,
I don't want to talk anymore.

992
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:19,500
Please go away and leave me in peace.

993
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,043
Buzz off!

994
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:23,754
No, I just want to sleep with you.

995
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,714
Idiot!

996
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:32,387
See you in your dreams, kid.

997
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,318
Here come the arhats who descend
from heaven for you.

998
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:50,781
The Dragon Slayer, the Tiger Tamer.

999
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,165
So Chan, you've tasted both sides of life.

1000
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:02,251
You bathed in pleasure
and drowned in misery.

1001
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:03,961
From that, you learn your lessons.

1002
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:06,964
As the seventh-generation disciple
of Hung Tsat Kung,

1003
01:07:07,047 --> 01:07:08,882
I dub thee the "Sleeping Arhat."

1004
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:12,386
So now, I shall pass down
the Sleeping Arhat Skill!

1005
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:14,596
Now, make good use of it. Awaken!

1006
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:23,939
Hey!

1007
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:32,114
"My misery is about to end."

1008
01:07:32,823 --> 01:07:36,827
JUSTICE

1009
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:40,998
-Long live our Lord!
-Long live our Lord!

1010
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,461
The lamb has come down
to restore order on Earth.

1011
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:51,258
Oh, Eternal Venerable Mother,
give me the strength

1012
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:52,759
to bring salvation!

1013
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,824
Tomorrow, the emperor will go hunting.

1014
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,994
I'll send out a fair maiden
to distract him.

1015
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:24,249
Yuen Ling, your mission is to
seduce him tomorrow.

1016
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,375
Yes, sir.

1017
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:28,295
Once we kill the emperor,

1018
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:30,505
I'll take over the throne,

1019
01:08:31,089 --> 01:08:33,592
and share with you some of the spoils!

1020
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:42,059
-Long live our Lord!
-Long live our Lord!

1021
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,144
-Senior?
-Let's head back.

1022
01:09:16,343 --> 01:09:17,177
Senior!

1023
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:18,220
Let's go!

1024
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:32,025
Senior!

1025
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:12,357
After them!

1026
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,277
Stop! The emperor is setting off soon.

1027
01:10:16,486 --> 01:10:17,654
You killed my woman,

1028
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,323
so you shall be my bait for the emperor!

1029
01:10:25,662 --> 01:10:28,415
What? No one wants to vie
for the leadership?

1030
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:30,959
What about Mok Lo Sam
with his Dog-Beating Stick?

1031
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:40,302
What's taking Uncle Mok
and your sister so long?

1032
01:10:40,927 --> 01:10:42,054
I don't know,

1033
01:10:42,512 --> 01:10:45,057
I saw them talking a while ago,

1034
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,224
then they set off.

1035
01:10:48,393 --> 01:10:49,853
Don't tell me, they have an affair.

1036
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,408
Now, we are going to elect our new leader.

1037
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:10,499
Uncle Mok!

1038
01:11:10,582 --> 01:11:12,167
I was worried you wouldn't come back.

1039
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,919
-How was it? Where's Yu Shueng?
-Are you okay?

1040
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:16,338
Chu Mo Kei caught her.

1041
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:19,091
We need someone to vie for the leadership.

1042
01:11:25,013 --> 01:11:26,515
Who should go?

1043
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:42,531
-I'll do it.
-Uncle Mok.

1044
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:43,865
Why don't you let me try?

1045
01:12:17,524 --> 01:12:20,569
Don't do it if you can't.

1046
01:12:21,695 --> 01:12:22,529
Chan!

1047
01:12:24,698 --> 01:12:26,700
You are not the Ninth Descendant.
Come down.

1048
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:31,163
So you've sent out a novice.
I'll whip him into shape!

1049
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:33,665
Chan, this is not a game!

1050
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,750
You will get killed! Get down!

1051
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:38,712
It's okay. I've given up on life already.

1052
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:40,839
-Bullshit! Throw at him!
-Yes!

1053
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:51,766
Well, if that's what you want...

1054
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:20,378
What is this?

1055
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,005
-What the--
-He's sleeping!

1056
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,230
Isn't this stance...

1057
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:41,316
Uncle Sun's Sleeping Arhat Skills?

1058
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,276
Formation!

1059
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:00,335
Is it morning?

1060
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:01,479
Sorry, guys. I've won!

1061
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:04,399
So what?
You don't use the Dog-Beating Stick!

1062
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:06,401
You can't be our chief!

1063
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:10,905
The Dog-Beating Stick...

1064
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:16,870
It's for hitting dogs.

1065
01:15:18,288 --> 01:15:20,206
I know how to do it!

1066
01:15:20,457 --> 01:15:22,834
It's different, but it's powerful!

1067
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,090
He broke the stick!

1068
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:33,345
He broke the treasure of our sect.
Kill him!

1069
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:49,611
I am Master Hung!
Who will dare to fight me?

1070
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,739
I made the rules of the sect.

1071
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:55,450
Whoever defeats the Lotus Formation,

1072
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:57,535
becomes the chief!

1073
01:15:57,952 --> 01:15:59,704
Have you all forgotten?

1074
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:02,582
We were once the greatest sect on earth

1075
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:04,417
because we were united!

1076
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:07,212
I left you the Dog-Beating Stick

1077
01:16:07,379 --> 01:16:09,798
only as a commemorative item.

1078
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:12,300
It has no meaning on its own,

1079
01:16:12,509 --> 01:16:14,594
but you fools assumed it as treasure

1080
01:16:14,678 --> 01:16:17,555
and fought among yourselves!

1081
01:16:17,722 --> 01:16:20,642
Five years without a chief.
Don't you have shame?

1082
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,561
So Chan did you a favor
by breaking the stick

1083
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,979
so you stop fighting over it!

1084
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:26,481
He may be young and unseasoned,

1085
01:16:26,564 --> 01:16:28,149
but he's a genius, brimming with talent!

1086
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:30,443
My disciple, Hung Yat Sun
is teaching him now.

1087
01:16:30,527 --> 01:16:32,445
So whoever goes against him
goes against me too!

1088
01:16:33,863 --> 01:16:36,449
Not only must you honor him,
but also show him some love!

1089
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:40,161
You shall cherish him, care for him,
and treat him for dinner often!

1090
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:41,621
I may be long gone,

1091
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:45,542
but I'll bless all of you from up there,
for eternity!

1092
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:48,920
Was it real?

1093
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:51,798
You better believe it.

1094
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,259
Master Hung's soul talked to us.

1095
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:56,594
That means we are blessed!

1096
01:16:57,595 --> 01:16:59,973
They fell for it. I'm a genius!

1097
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:02,016
Things are looking up now!

1098
01:17:04,602 --> 01:17:05,854
What happened?

1099
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:09,524
-Hail our new chief!
-Hail our new chief!

1100
01:17:12,652 --> 01:17:16,614
We had faith in you, so you won!

1101
01:17:18,992 --> 01:17:21,578
Uncle Mok, isn't my son brilliant?

1102
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,790
I didn't think
you would learn the Sleeping Arhat.

1103
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:30,462
From now on, you are our new chief.

1104
01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:33,423
This is the book of
Dragon-Subduing Stances.

1105
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,966
And I present you the Great Elixir Pill.

1106
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:38,261
May you lead the sect with wisdom.

1107
01:17:39,596 --> 01:17:41,347
I just want to save Yu Shueng
as soon as possible.

1108
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,268
Yu Shueng chose wisely.

1109
01:17:45,769 --> 01:17:49,230
Hooray to our new chief!

1110
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:57,906
Uncle Mok, are you okay?

1111
01:17:59,365 --> 01:18:01,075
Uncle Mok!

1112
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,622
Uncle Mok!

1113
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,008
Chan, do you understand everything
written in this book?

1114
01:18:59,217 --> 01:19:00,885
Are you taking me for a fool?

1115
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:02,720
With the help of the Great Elixir Pill,

1116
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:05,807
not only have I restored my strength,
I've also increased it.

1117
01:19:06,224 --> 01:19:08,643
I've managed to master 17
out of the 18 stances.

1118
01:19:09,686 --> 01:19:12,063
But for the last stance,
"The Dragon-slayer's Remorse,"

1119
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:13,731
there's no picture or description of it.

1120
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,066
I just don't get it.

1121
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:18,778
But Uncle Mok is dead,
what will we do now?

1122
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:20,697
Just move on from that!

1123
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,490
I have to save Yu Shueng first,
no matter what.

1124
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,393
It's the Emperor's order,
to succeed no matter what!

1125
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,064
Is the camp all set up?

1126
01:20:36,147 --> 01:20:37,023
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1127
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,044
Chu Mo Kei,

1128
01:20:58,628 --> 01:21:01,047
why did you bring this woman here?

1129
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,674
I know the Emperor likes fair maidens,

1130
01:21:03,257 --> 01:21:04,926
so I would like to present her
to him as a gift.

1131
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:06,844
And I would like to meet the Emperor.

1132
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,347
His Majesty didn't call upon anyone,
so don't disturb him.

1133
01:21:10,056 --> 01:21:12,100
Men, take this woman to the camp.

1134
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:13,142
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1135
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:14,477
Go.

1136
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,566
Sir, long time no see. You look great!

1137
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,028
You better return to your station.

1138
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,613
And don't escape!

1139
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:27,323
Yes, sir.

1140
01:21:43,214 --> 01:21:46,175
Your Majesty, Officer Chiu would like
to present this woman to you.

1141
01:21:46,884 --> 01:21:47,760
A woman?

1142
01:21:50,054 --> 01:21:51,180
Chiu knows my hobby!

1143
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:54,350
I need to take a bath.
Bring her to me later.

1144
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:55,393
Yes, sir.

1145
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:21,627
That bastard wants to see the Emperor.

1146
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:25,965
If I let him see His Majesty too often,
I could lose my office.

1147
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:31,846
Men!

1148
01:22:33,598 --> 01:22:34,432
Yes, sir?

1149
01:22:34,682 --> 01:22:36,100
-See what's going on!
-Yes, sir!

1150
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:42,732
Sir, there's a mob of people
coming out of the woods!

1151
01:22:43,608 --> 01:22:44,609
Who are they?

1152
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:45,943
I don't know!

1153
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,571
Release the smoke signal and stay alert!

1154
01:22:48,654 --> 01:22:49,489
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1155
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,666
There's smoke ahead. Brace yourselves!

1156
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,584
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1157
01:24:03,396 --> 01:24:04,605
Damned beggars.

1158
01:24:09,443 --> 01:24:11,487
So Cha Ha Yee Chan,
what on earth are you doing?

1159
01:24:12,572 --> 01:24:15,658
Nothing. I'm just here to beg for money.

1160
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,369
Preposterous! Now, you're asking for it!

1161
01:24:18,786 --> 01:24:19,996
You're the one asking for it.

1162
01:24:21,455 --> 01:24:24,458
Chiu wants to stage a mutiny.
He's going to assassinate the Emperor.

1163
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:25,877
And you're standing there like a fool!

1164
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:28,129
Who do you think you are?

1165
01:24:28,546 --> 01:24:31,132
How dare you falsely accuse
the imperial courtier?

1166
01:24:31,507 --> 01:24:33,968
One step forward and I'll wipe you out!

1167
01:24:38,014 --> 01:24:40,933
Chan, there's so many of them.
How do we beat them?

1168
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:41,934
-Senior?
-Yes, chief?

1169
01:24:42,643 --> 01:24:43,603
Where are the others?

1170
01:24:43,686 --> 01:24:45,062
They are on their way.

1171
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:47,773
There's no time.

1172
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,067
You stay here to wait for the others.
I will go first--

1173
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,819
-I'm coming with you!
-Are you serious?

1174
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:53,154
Chief, just relax and go.

1175
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,865
You want me to die?

1176
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,617
Do you have anything better
to say than that?

1177
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:58,701
Yes.

1178
01:24:58,784 --> 01:25:02,622
May you live a long life of bliss

1179
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,583
As we celebrate your birthday

1180
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,543
It falls once every year--

1181
01:25:07,627 --> 01:25:09,128
-That's enough.
-I haven't finished.

1182
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,922
-Carry on after I leave.
-Okay.

1183
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:25,519
There is smoke ahead,
someone must have alarmed them.

1184
01:25:28,397 --> 01:25:29,732
-Prepare the Unicorn Smoke.
-Yes, sir!

1185
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:30,691
Let's raid the main camp!

1186
01:26:32,044 --> 01:26:35,214
It's a mutiny! Go call for help!

1187
01:26:36,048 --> 01:26:37,133
How terrible!

1188
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:39,135
Terrible is the one
who didn't shoot you down.

1189
01:26:40,136 --> 01:26:42,430
Oh, no. There's poison smoke
heading toward the royal tent.

1190
01:26:42,638 --> 01:26:43,931
This is terrible!

1191
01:26:49,937 --> 01:26:51,522
Oh, no, the wind is blowing the other way!

1192
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:53,858
That's good. Hey, wait up!

1193
01:26:55,818 --> 01:26:58,404
If the beggars don't retreat now,
we will show them no mercy!

1194
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,174
Look over there!

1195
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,221
It's the Unicorn Smoke of the Tin Li Sect.

1196
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:37,193
Relax, we can use urine to detoxify.

1197
01:27:37,943 --> 01:27:39,403
Everyone, let's piss!

1198
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,202
What about me?

1199
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:47,912
Relax, I'll give you some.

1200
01:27:47,995 --> 01:27:49,497
Come, hold it.

1201
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:56,629
Charge!

1202
01:28:06,013 --> 01:28:06,847
What happened?

1203
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,225
Luckily, Your Majesty,
the wind blew the other way.

1204
01:28:09,308 --> 01:28:10,601
So the smoke is moving elsewhere.

1205
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:12,103
What about our troops?

1206
01:28:12,478 --> 01:28:13,896
They are completely wiped out.

1207
01:28:15,314 --> 01:28:17,149
-Bring me my sword!
-No, don't!

1208
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:18,567
Stand aside, all of you!

1209
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:20,986
Your Majesty, it's dangerous. Don't go!

1210
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:23,572
I'm not going to sit here to die.
Now, stand aside!

1211
01:28:25,074 --> 01:28:26,450
I said, move aside!

1212
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:29,120
Don't go!

1213
01:29:07,533 --> 01:29:08,367
Cover me.

1214
01:29:33,893 --> 01:29:34,727
Chan?

1215
01:29:36,979 --> 01:29:37,813
Yu Shueng.

1216
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:39,315
How did you get here?

1217
01:29:39,773 --> 01:29:41,775
It's a long story.

1218
01:29:41,984 --> 01:29:43,777
We set off from our base last night,

1219
01:29:43,944 --> 01:29:47,239
and this morning,
we broke through the Great Wall.

1220
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,742
We stopped an hour for lunch,

1221
01:29:49,825 --> 01:29:50,910
and I even pissed once.

1222
01:29:51,035 --> 01:29:51,869
-Really?
-Yes.

1223
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:54,163
I wanted a sweet potato,
but dumplings are all we had left.

1224
01:29:54,413 --> 01:29:56,707
You know I don't really like dumplings.

1225
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:00,002
Forgive me for my tardiness, Your Majesty.

1226
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:03,255
Protect the Emperor!

1227
01:30:03,339 --> 01:30:04,173
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1228
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:09,303
You traitor. Catch him!

1229
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:16,518
Your Majesty!

1230
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:21,732
Surrender your empire to me, bastard!

1231
01:30:21,815 --> 01:30:23,108
What did you say?

1232
01:30:26,028 --> 01:30:26,862
It's you!

1233
01:30:26,946 --> 01:30:28,822
Yes, it's me, Beggar So.

1234
01:30:29,365 --> 01:30:32,451
Aren't you supposed to be
sleeping in your shack?

1235
01:30:32,618 --> 01:30:34,870
Well, I am a little bit sleepy.

1236
01:31:12,157 --> 01:31:13,117
The Sleeping Arhat stance?

1237
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:17,413
That's right! Look at you,
you look like a beggar too.

1238
01:31:17,663 --> 01:31:19,123
Would you like to join us?

1239
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:23,335
I didn't think you would bounce back.

1240
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:25,629
Yes, it's all because of you.

1241
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:31,969
Is that all you got?
You haven't seen mine.

1242
01:31:50,321 --> 01:31:53,824
Fool! No martial art technique on earth
can stop me now,

1243
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:55,576
except the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

1244
01:32:07,546 --> 01:32:09,798
Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms,
Stance Seven!

1245
01:32:12,343 --> 01:32:13,677
The dragon soars in the sky!

1246
01:32:14,928 --> 01:32:16,722
It swishes its tail, steals your heart.

1247
01:32:16,805 --> 01:32:19,183
Traversing the oceans and fields.
The dragon dances and mingles!

1248
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:22,478
We're the blessed children of the dragon,
possessing the spirit of a dragon!

1249
01:32:22,561 --> 01:32:23,854
The end!

1250
01:32:58,347 --> 01:33:00,891
That's just 17 of them.
What about the last one?

1251
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,268
You can only defeat me
if you've learned the 18th stance.

1252
01:33:03,352 --> 01:33:04,812
But you don't stand a chance.

1253
01:33:12,778 --> 01:33:13,737
Chan!

1254
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,546
I got it! Just mix the 17 stances,

1255
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:31,839
and that makes the 18th!

1256
01:33:32,047 --> 01:33:34,091
I'm one hell of a genius!

1257
01:34:03,787 --> 01:34:06,457
The 18th stance,
The Dragon-slayer's Remorse!

1258
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,322
Chan, are you all right?

1259
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:40,240
Don't I look all right to you?

1260
01:34:40,949 --> 01:34:42,367
Your pose is really smart.

1261
01:34:42,618 --> 01:34:43,994
But you look awful!

1262
01:34:44,077 --> 01:34:45,204
I'm fine.

1263
01:34:45,287 --> 01:34:46,705
I think I can marry tonight.

1264
01:34:46,788 --> 01:34:47,956
Can you?

1265
01:34:58,133 --> 01:34:59,468
Chan! Are you okay?

1266
01:34:59,551 --> 01:35:00,886
-Yu Shueng!
-Tsui!

1267
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:01,970
Where's Chiu?

1268
01:35:02,971 --> 01:35:04,264
He's somewhere around here.

1269
01:35:04,348 --> 01:35:05,766
Is he?

1270
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,518
He's reduced to ashes.

1271
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:10,312
He's reduced to ashes? It can't be!

1272
01:35:10,646 --> 01:35:11,480
Chief.

1273
01:35:11,563 --> 01:35:13,482
We've caught all of Chiu's minions.

1274
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:18,487
Thank you, my friends!

1275
01:35:22,533 --> 01:35:23,367
Yu Shueng.

1276
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:25,327
Remember what I promised you?

1277
01:35:26,411 --> 01:35:30,082
Yes, that you would be
a martial arts champion

1278
01:35:30,207 --> 01:35:32,125
who's second to no one on earth.

1279
01:35:32,376 --> 01:35:34,044
Too bad I failed.

1280
01:35:34,211 --> 01:35:37,297
Of course, I never liked champions.

1281
01:35:37,464 --> 01:35:38,840
I prefer beggars.

1282
01:35:40,676 --> 01:35:42,135
Go ahead, my boy!

1283
01:35:55,482 --> 01:35:59,069
Sengge Rinchen,
you've really crossed the line!

1284
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:00,946
For all the trouble you caused,

1285
01:36:01,154 --> 01:36:03,156
I sentence you to be a beggar!

1286
01:36:03,448 --> 01:36:05,951
It's good that you're a beggar.
You're born to be one.

1287
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:07,953
See you at the temple tomorrow.

1288
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,830
Call me if anything.

1289
01:36:11,456 --> 01:36:13,709
Thank you for bringing me in, chief!

1290
01:36:13,792 --> 01:36:16,545
So Chan, what would you like as a reward?

1291
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,799
Nothing at all?

1292
01:36:25,053 --> 01:36:27,180
Nothing, really. Let's go.

1293
01:36:28,056 --> 01:36:28,932
Carry me up.

1294
01:36:29,933 --> 01:36:31,518
Mr. So!

1295
01:36:31,602 --> 01:36:32,603
Put me down.

1296
01:36:33,186 --> 01:36:34,354
Although you saved me,

1297
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:36,773
I'll still have you executed
if you don't show respect.

1298
01:36:37,816 --> 01:36:40,402
Even so, you don't have
to come to me like this.

1299
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:43,363
It's better not to get up,
or it might look ugly.

1300
01:36:46,325 --> 01:36:48,076
I have no disagreements with you,

1301
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,786
so there's nothing to talk about.

1302
01:36:50,287 --> 01:36:51,788
But I'm rather disturbed,

1303
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,166
seeing that you've gathered a brotherhood
that comes in millions.

1304
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:57,169
It wasn't me who gathered so many beggars.

1305
01:36:57,252 --> 01:36:58,378
You did.

1306
01:36:58,670 --> 01:36:59,504
What?

1307
01:37:00,631 --> 01:37:03,592
If you're wise enough to create
a peaceful and prosperous society,

1308
01:37:03,967 --> 01:37:05,761
you wouldn't want to create beggars,
would you?

1309
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,349
-Makes sense, right?
-The more you know.

1310
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:12,059
Well,

1311
01:37:12,517 --> 01:37:14,686
perhaps I'll do the honor
by stepping down the throne.

1312
01:37:15,854 --> 01:37:16,688
Sure.

1313
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,650
-Long live the emperor!
-Get up.

1314
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:28,241
Hey! Remember me?

1315
01:37:28,533 --> 01:37:30,202
Of course, you're the beggar!

1316
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:32,162
You're now using that girl
to gain my favor?

1317
01:37:32,245 --> 01:37:33,664
Yes, if you could be so kind.

1318
01:37:33,789 --> 01:37:35,791
Not in a million years. Go!

1319
01:37:35,874 --> 01:37:37,000
You're not going anywhere.

1320
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,293
It's an obligation!

1321
01:37:39,461 --> 01:37:42,005
You're begging in the emperor's name?
Are you kidding me?

1322
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,591
I'm not kidding you!
Now, give me what you got.

1323
01:37:44,675 --> 01:37:45,717
I was unlucky to see you.

1324
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:46,927
Hold it right there!

1325
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:48,261
What now?

1326
01:37:48,345 --> 01:37:51,139
I got a family to fend here.
Now, give us more!

1327
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:52,349
How much?

1328
01:37:52,432 --> 01:37:54,226
No less than a thousand, okay?

1329
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:00,107
-Say thank you to him.
-Yes!

1330
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:02,317
Thank you, sir!

1331
01:38:02,442 --> 01:38:04,027
Eat up, kids!

1332
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:08,865
Come with me. Let's go!

1333
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:13,537
Hurry up. I want my sweets.

1334
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,832
Give me one too.
