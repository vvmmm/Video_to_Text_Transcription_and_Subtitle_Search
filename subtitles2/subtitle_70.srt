1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,400
FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

2
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,867
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

3
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,004
{\an8}Leave it. I'll do it.

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,681
Are you done eating?

5
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,485
You should've just come in to eat with us.

6
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,282
How can I take my share
when you ordered four servings?

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,454
Did Ji-woo eat the hangover soup?

8
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,906
He emptied the bowl.

9
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,457
I raised him well.

10
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,333
Get to the point.

11
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,594
Youâ¦

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,758
went on a trip with your parents

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,928
every vacation.

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,757
Even after you turned 30.

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,056
A photo of you and your parents
on a trip, smiling happily.

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,979
I remember it.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,230
So this is why you're so warm-hearted.

18
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,017
You and your parents

19
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,441
are so bright.

20
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,401
I was envious.

21
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,454
You're warm.

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,663
It's no use for you to act grumpy.

23
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,793
You're good at comforting
people who are hurt.

24
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,285
That's why I left my sister in your hands.

25
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,802
I have no other intentions.

26
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,166
All right.

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,798
I don't think you had
any other intentions, okay?

28
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,595
Please let my sister know this.

29
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,346
Even if she feels betrayed
and angry at her husband,

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,055
she shouldn't say hurtful and nasty words.

31
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,726
She shouldn't say something
she doesn't mean.

32
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,281
I'm really worried, that's why.

33
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,284
My sister would be
a serial killer if words could kill.

34
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,155
That's too extreme.
I'm going to tell Eun-joo.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,670
What is it?

36
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,126
Seeing you smile

37
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,625
makes me feel a lot better.

38
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,388
I'mâ¦

39
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,216
going to be friends with you for real.

40
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,347
True friends.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,901
Totally friends.

42
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,193
What's with you?

43
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,357
Oh, friends forever

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,367
Do you have to do this
in our neighborhood?

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,490
Yes!

46
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,874
I think I can really go now.

47
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,166
I'm leaving, my friend!

48
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,091
Bye!

49
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,797
Seriouslyâ¦

50
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,604
The feeling of deja vu,
like having the same day before.

51
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,768
My heart is beating for you.

52
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,021
Me laughing so hard,
trying not to get caught.

53
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,033
It always ends with self-hypnotization,

54
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,531
saying "Well done,
you did the right thing,"

55
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,871
then and now.

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,036
And my solidified heart

57
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,833
does not break easily.

58
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,598
Since when have you guys been there?

59
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,021
Give me 10,000 won.

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,231
Why? Tell me if you need money.

61
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,901
I said it seems like Eun-hee is here,

62
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,111
and he said she's not.

63
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,899
So I won the bet.

64
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,189
Give me 10,000 won!

65
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,985
Why did you give that to her?

66
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,294
Is Eun-hee a stalker?

67
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,158
She even came to the office
for not answering her calls?

68
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,576
Your sister is tenacious, you know.

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,785
Chan-hyuk.

70
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,094
I was going to tell Seo-young
to stop calling her

71
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,418
by her name, but I didn't.

72
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,463
Don't hold back. Tell her to stop it.

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,380
I'm holding it back
because I know how she feels.

74
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,635
She likes you.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,935
And you know she likes you.

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,270
I do.

77
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,895
And I know that she shows it on purpose,
regardless of who's around her.

78
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,107
But do you know why?

79
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,034
Because she likes you. What else is there?

80
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,164
No.

81
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,871
Seo-young isâ¦

82
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,502
Seo-young is tricking herself
into liking me.

83
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,501
-When she actually doesn't.
-Why?

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,044
There is a reason.

85
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,337
You will know
if you get close to Seo-young too.

86
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,132
Well, if you're curious, ask her directly.

87
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,257
Come on, Chan-hyuk,
what are you talking about?

88
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,394
Not me. I think of her
as my coworker only. For real.

89
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,893
You're denying it seriously.

90
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,684
I don't pry into employees' privacy.

91
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,138
I have a girlfriend.

92
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,822
Do you think I wouldn't know
if you have a girlfriend?

93
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,649
You're making a ridiculous excuse,
so it means youâ¦

94
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,105
I really do have a girlfriend.

95
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,373
Donât tell my family.

96
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,413
It's top-secret. I'll tell you later.

97
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,885
One hot Americano, please.

98
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,100
Okay.

99
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,022
Yes.

100
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,438
I arrived.

101
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,187
-Happy birthday dear Yu-jeong
-Happy birthday dear Yu-jeong

102
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,566
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

103
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,709
JUNE 13, EUN-JOO'S BIRTHDAY

104
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,456
I never cared about her birthday, anyway.

105
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,027
November 13â¦

106
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,655
December 13â¦

107
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:39,577
January. February, March, April, Mayâ¦

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,594
June.

109
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,175
Was Kim Eun-joo born prematurely?

110
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,847
No.

111
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,143
I heard Mom was pregnant with her
when the photo was taken.

112
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,524
October 13, 1982.

113
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,563
That was the day
I proposed to your mother.

114
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,273
On that day,

115
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:07,317
I held Ms. Sook's hand for the first time.

116
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,364
Are Dad's memories

117
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,201
not completely back yet?

118
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,044
Ms. Kim Eun-hee?

119
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,423
Are you here to see Kyung-ok?

120
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,462
Yes.

121
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,215
I'm Jeon Ha-ra,
Kyung-ok's junior from school.

122
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,717
I'm Kim Eun-hee.

123
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,548
Howâ¦

124
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,973
You found me at once.

125
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,265
I saw the photo you took with Kyung-ok.

126
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,888
You look much younger than in the photo.

127
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,652
Kyung-ok is always
at least 30 minutes lateâ¦

128
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,694
She's coming. Kyung-ok.

129
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,186
Hi, girls.

130
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,986
What the heck?
Did you two become friends already?

131
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,994
We just said hi.

132
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,786
Ms. Eun-hee was here first.

133
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,539
No need to use honorifics.
You two are the same age.

134
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,787
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

135
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,995
You have a baby face.

136
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,165
Thank you.

137
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,013
Now, it's time for a proper introduction.

138
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,549
This is Jeon Ha-ra, my junior
from elementary, middle, and high school.

139
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,814
And this is Kim Eun-hee,
my junior from work.

140
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,345
-Say hi.
-Hi.

141
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,361
Ha-ra is my personal stylist
who changed my style.

142
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,476
Did I become your personal stylist?

143
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,237
I knew it.

144
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,398
I could see the touch of a professional.

145
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,567
Eun-hee was so envious of me,

146
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,907
saying my style got so awesome,

147
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,703
so I decided to share my personal stylist.

148
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,617
Aren't you thankful?

149
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,826
I'm so thankful.

150
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,916
Since I came here last, I'll pay.

151
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,632
What would you like to drink?

152
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,012
I drank mine already.

153
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,378
I'd likeâ¦

154
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,724
-Kyung-ok, let's order together.
-Shall we? Okay.

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,010
Do you have any specific kind
of cake you like?

156
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,764
Anything is fine.

157
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,063
People who say
"anything is fine" isn't fun.

158
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,731
Since I'm the personal stylist today,

159
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,561
I should change your taste in things.

160
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,820
-Let's go, Kyung-ok.
-Yes, let's go.

161
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,952
Before I got married,

162
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,409
Dad came to my workplace.

163
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,393
When he wasn't making
enough for the familyâ¦

164
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,345
He said it was a debt to me.

165
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,769
He saved up for seven years
but apologized for not having enough.

166
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,158
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

167
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,951
KIM SANG-SIK

168
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,751
He calculated the money
to pay me back every day.

169
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,509
Even if I insisted
I wouldn't take it, it was no use.

170
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,760
He asked me

171
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,927
to keep it a secret.

172
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,934
Why tell the secret
between the two after all this time?

173
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,483
I don't need this money anymore.

174
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,942
I don't want to be compensated
for that time like this.

175
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,320
To think of how Dad spent seven years
to save this moneyâ¦

176
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,822
It hurts me to look at the bankbook.

177
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,534
Okay.

178
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,865
I get it.

179
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,214
I guess I was shocked
because the amount is so big.

180
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,287
Dad can't keep sleeping in his truck.

181
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,844
At least help him get a place.

182
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,965
I know that

183
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,718
he wasn't a great husband.

184
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,601
Butâ¦

185
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,267
You prepared for graduation
from marriage for a long time.

186
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,774
But Dad was suddenly forced to do it,
when he never thought about it, ever.

187
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,278
That'sâ¦

188
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,294
shocking enough
to break his body and mind.

189
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,919
You are being

190
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,714
too cruel to him.

191
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,682
Okay, I get it.

192
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,731
Butâ¦

193
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,984
Iâ¦

194
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,154
reallyâ¦

195
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,403
want to rest.

196
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
Why do I feel so sad?

197
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,857
Is my time

198
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,815
and my life

199
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,190
worth less than a single bankbook?

200
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,348
OCTOBER 13, 1982

201
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,592
Was the change
in Kyung-ok's style good enough

202
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,881
to make you envious?

203
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,974
Of course.

204
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,221
I don't know that much about it,

205
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,221
but she had
this natural sophisticated charm.

206
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,764
You say things in such a complicated way.

207
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,768
What does "natural
sophisticated charm" mean?

208
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,692
Oh.

209
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,068
It means something positive,
like a sudden change in style

210
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,569
can look awkward, but it wasn't like that.

211
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,651
That's because I got a solid foundation.

212
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,358
So it means something positive.

213
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,408
I don't like changing things
too suddenly to show it.

214
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,793
I like natural things.

215
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,407
Right.

216
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,036
Ha-ra totally hates changes.

217
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,209
She's been dating only one man
for nine years.

218
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:29,087
How about we reveal it now,
so Eun-hee can be shocked?

219
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,258
Come on, why would it be shocking?

220
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,887
It's an obvious story.

221
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,639
Ha-raâ¦

222
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:43,278
is our vice CEO's nine-year girlfriend.

223
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,625
You must be so shocked.

224
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,171
Of course, I'm shocked.

225
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,126
It's not an obvious story.

226
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,183
Right. Look at your face.

227
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:16,522
You're totally shocked, right?

228
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,810
Right.

229
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,346
Eun-hee,

230
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:25,227
you have trauma
about nine-year relationships.

231
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,607
Change of topic.

232
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,275
Let's finish and go shopping.

233
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,703
What's the trauma?

234
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,075
I'll tell you about that later.

235
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,369
Don't you think we should
change her style, too?

236
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,326
No, thanks. It's hard to make me stylish.

237
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,627
It's not hard.

238
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,673
Feminine beauty, but not too much.
Coy, but not too much.

239
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,878
You act like you don't care,

240
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,801
but youâre obsessed
with the intellectual vibe.

241
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,096
I always try not to overdo it,

242
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,979
but I'm not obsessed.

243
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,780
Okay.

244
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,282
I know a shop
that would totally suit Eun-hee.

245
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,494
Let's go.

246
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,784
Yes, let's go.

247
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,038
Let's use our credit cards
until we get tired of using them.

248
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,132
No, thanks. I wouldn't have come here
if I knew you were going shopping.

249
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
I feel uncomfortable then.

250
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,173
Like I got in between you two.

251
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,553
Come with us.

252
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,672
Yes, I'm Kim Eun-hee.

253
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,508
You're nothing but a cheater,
and you dared to come here with Jong-min?

254
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,015
Is the past me and the current me

255
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,189
different in any aspect?

256
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,768
Yes, let's go.

257
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,154
Let's go.

258
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,027
Okay, ready.

259
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,527
Look here, Seo-young.

260
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,245
Shoot the product first.

261
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,879
This is so annoying.

262
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,593
What is it? What happened?

263
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,383
This is so annoying!

264
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
That punkâ¦

265
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,732
looked at my social media page
and said I look well.

266
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,560
He said he's glad that I look well.

267
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,898
Didn't you expect this to happen
when you started social media?

268
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,947
I did expect it.

269
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,659
I was prepared for it too.

270
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,829
But he was friends with my mom.

271
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,581
Seriouslyâ¦

272
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,246
I want to move out of the house.

273
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,924
Think straight.

274
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,922
Your mother isn't the problem.

275
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,800
How do you feel after seeing his comment?

276
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,514
Like a rollercoaster.

277
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,427
It goes up all of a sudden,

278
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,189
I get chills,

279
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,154
and I get angry.

280
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,774
Something like that.

281
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,571
You're doing so well compared to before.

282
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,118
To be honest, these daysâ¦

283
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,615
I sometimes forget about it while I work.

284
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,288
Yes.

285
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,749
Even if you can sometimes forget it,

286
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,838
you'll neverâ¦

287
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,803
forget that memory.

288
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,549
Butâ¦

289
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,103
try forgetting from time to time
for longer periods.

290
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,902
Then you should

291
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,148
think of me as a woman from time to time.

292
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,201
And try doing that for longer periods.

293
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,988
You saying something
like that at a time like this

294
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,332
makes me wonder
if you're actually okay or not.

295
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,406
It's all thanks to you.

296
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,333
In five minutes.

297
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,077
Noâ¦

298
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,036
I'll begin in a moment.

299
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,206
Okay.

300
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,425
Didn't feel to go shopping after a while?

301
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,682
Money is something
you're supposed to spend.

302
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,515
One, two, three, four, five.

303
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,846
Oh, my.

304
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,146
Vice CEO.

305
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,029
Looks like he's here for dinner.

306
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,609
Do you mind?

307
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,370
Yes.

308
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,527
I do.

309
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,371
Do you feel uncomfortable?

310
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,248
Yes. You two go ahead.

311
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,252
-Kyung-ok, let's go then.
-Yes.

312
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,134
We need to talk alone.

313
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,211
Come on, say hi at least.

314
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,588
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,716
No, it's okay.

316
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,679
Let's go.

317
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,313
You two can eat here.

318
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,560
We're only going to talk.

319
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,811
We're not going to eat.

320
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,305
-Let's go.
-Yes.

321
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,816
Let's go to your house.

322
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,152
What the heck?

323
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,447
They can't eat together,
but they can go home together?

324
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,924
I guess she doesn't want
rumors to spread at work.

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,210
She held things back,
no matter what I said.

326
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,134
How did you know?

327
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,173
Youâ¦

328
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,182
Did you read my emails too?

329
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,439
Actually, I've been dying to
come here today.

330
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,021
I'm so thankful
as they disappeared on their own.

331
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,856
Let's see.

332
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,356
This one.

333
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,582
-Kyung-ok.
-Yes?

334
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,664
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing your junior with you?

335
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,592
I forgot because I was in a hurry.

336
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,048
Right?

337
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,958
I thought so too.

338
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,588
To be honest, Ha-ra was curious about

339
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,336
female employees in the company.

340
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,468
I guess she wanted to see the women

341
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,265
who were working for her boyfriend.

342
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,188
Hey, but, can't you understand
how she feels?

343
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,648
I could totally understand her.

344
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,863
You know Mr. Choi with a bad temper?

345
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,993
He said that he saw Young-sik walking
here and there at this place.

346
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,703
But Young-sik's leg is not well,

347
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,411
and he's too weak to work here.

348
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,945
He's young.

349
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,748
You also once ran here
and there at a place like this.

350
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,208
And you got hurt.

351
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,839
Young-sik? Why are you looking for him?

352
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,178
Because we have a reason to look for him.

353
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,599
He's the child of this man here.

354
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,888
The child?

355
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,016
He went somewhere else.
Everyone here is a wandering laborer.

356
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,655
If he's on the run like this,
it's obviously about money.

357
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,568
Sang-sik, tell me the truth.

358
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,527
You have money issues with him, right?

359
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,423
Sang-sik, where are you going?

360
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,588
The workers won't like it.

361
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,376
Get out. You're not supposed to be here.

362
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,458
-Get out!
-Okay.

363
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,254
-Get out!
-Okay.

364
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,828
Eun-joo.

365
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,379
Have you been like this
by yourself all this time?

366
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,342
I haven't. I'll go wash my face.

367
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,492
I thought I knew you well.

368
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,332
But I didn't know
you would suffer so much.

369
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,578
It's not because of you.

370
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,877
I saw my Mom.

371
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,923
Did something happen to her?

372
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,973
I showed off for making money
when my father was injured

373
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,798
and my family was struggling.

374
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,046
I said mean things to Mom,

375
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,306
because I hate graduation from marriage.

376
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,269
So it is because of me.

377
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,517
Don't blame yourself.
You put your anger out on your mother.

378
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,153
I hated her cold attitude toward Dad.

379
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,821
She never laughed,
even if something joyful happened.

380
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,320
It was uncomfortable.

381
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,568
I'm like my mom.
I push my family away from me.

382
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,775
You never pushed them away.
Our problem is because of me.

383
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,209
Do you know what I regret?

384
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,341
I regret

385
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,552
letting Eun-hee
sleep at our house that day.

386
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,893
If she didn't know,
I would've tricked everyone.

387
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,759
I would've just told you to live.
I'll act like I don't know.

388
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,387
-It's not so hard, right?
-Eun-jooâ¦

389
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,933
Don't you think it's creepy?

390
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm just like your parents, aren't I?

391
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,273
You're different. You just need time.

392
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,067
You wanted to be friends.

393
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,954
Yes.

394
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,238
Just live here as friends.

395
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,367
That'll make things harder.

396
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,788
Let's break up quickly.

397
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,370
Are you being considerate to me?

398
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,713
If so, I will try and experience
how much harder things get for me.

399
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,463
-I can't do it anymore.
-After tricking me for years?

400
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,349
Did you have to tell me

401
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,481
when I was dealing with my parent's issue?

402
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,228
Couldn't you be more considerate?

403
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,362
Tae-hyung, even if you feel uncomfortable,

404
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:33,489
you're family too, so I thought
you should hear it together.

405
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,698
-Mom, hereâ¦
-No, put it in front of Tae-hyung.

406
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,624
It was painful

407
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,159
because your mother and father
treated me like family.

408
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,174
Then you tell them yourself. I can't.

409
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:23,243
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

410
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,329
KIM SANG-SIK

411
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,345
You must be glad that

412
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,395
your life can be calculated accurately.

413
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,587
Not everyone in the world
is skilled like me.

414
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,008
There are those without skills.
Then who should do it for them?

415
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,258
Now, first,

416
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,295
wipe with alcohol.

417
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,428
And dry them,
so they can be attached nicely.

418
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,403
Help me out.

419
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,863
I can't. My hands are tied.

420
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,739
Okay, let's take a break.

421
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,631
Hello?

422
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,712
When are you coming? Did you eat dinner?

423
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,917
I'm still busy. Why?

424
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,548
Right.

425
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,472
Call your father
and ask him to stop by the house.

426
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,313
Hello?

427
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,102
I can't tell Dad to leave
and then come back.

428
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,357
Mom, you call him from now on.
I'm hanging up.

429
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,363
You can't keep sleeping
in the truck forever.

430
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,284
You can find a place with Young-sik.

431
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,117
I can only ask him to live with me
when I remember something.

432
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,924
That wretched memory!

433
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,459
That damn memory!

434
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,549
Sang-sik.

435
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,125
Why?

436
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,386
The guitar in your car.

437
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,308
Play the guitar.

438
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,385
-What?
-You can play the guitar too.

439
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,805
It's just like driving.

440
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,234
Go bring the guitar.

441
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,191
I can play the guitar?

442
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,275
Of course.

443
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,160
When you ate with me and had coffee,

444
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:52,198
you used to play the guitar
and sing for me.

445
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,177
Man-ho.

446
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,428
-Yes?
-Did I really play the guitar

447
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,596
and sing for you?

448
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,522
Are you sure you're not just saying things
because my memories are on and off, right?

449
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,903
Did I really do that?

450
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,823
Did I?

451
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,783
Sang-sikâ¦

452
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,119
I should get going now.

453
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,744
Sang-sik, it's your wife.

454
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,874
Come on, answer the phone.
What if she changed her mind?

455
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,251
I had an affair and a kid.

456
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,843
I will not interrupt
Ms. Sook's life anymore.

457
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,260
You're like a rat being nice to a cat.

458
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,597
What? A rat?

459
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,978
A rat.

460
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,268
-Hey, youâ¦
-No.

461
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,651
-Come here.
-My leg!

462
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,018
I just can'tâ¦

463
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,402
MISSED CALLS
JIN-SOOK

464
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,832
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

465
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,181
VICE CEO IM

466
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,860
Hello?

467
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,743
Were you waiting for his call?

468
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,323
Do you think he'd call you

469
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,702
when he's with me?

470
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,203
Hey, Ms. Kim Eun-hee.

471
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,171
Say something!

472
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,206
Do you think I'm doing this
because I have regrets?

473
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,678
I'm just trying to pay back
for what I've suffered.

474
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,259
I asked him to break up three years ago!

475
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,305
-Stop it.
-Do you remember

476
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,563
how much you harassed me at the time?

477
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,773
You should suffer too.

478
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,200
Don't move. Stay still.

479
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,711
She's not young,

480
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,296
not pretty,

481
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,297
looks poor

482
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,849
and has a rotten mind
to have an affair with her boss.

483
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,144
It's embarrassing to be
like this because of her.

484
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,614
Is this your revenge from three years ago?

485
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,978
Then get a girl who measures up.

486
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,915
THISTLE: THIS IS THE SECOND PROPOSAL

487
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,966
THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK.
I'M SENDING YOU THE REVISED PROPOSAL

488
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,432
{\an8}THE FIRST PLAN WAS FULL OF TYPOS!
JANE, DON'T LEARN KOREAN FROM ME!

489
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,699
I have a friend
who likes Vincent van Gogh.

490
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,830
And he said he recalls landscape paintings
by Van Gogh whenever he takes photos

491
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,331
because he can see the angle
to take the photos.

492
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,036
That's cool.

493
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,576
I want to see your friend's photos.

494
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,882
I want to see them too.

495
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,257
Why can't you see them?

496
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,303
Because I broke his heart
with harsh words.

497
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,933
Like Van Gogh.

498
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,933
If you regret it, apologize.

499
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,933
I'm sure you miss your friend
and want to see the photos he took.

500
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,645
I'm afraid he might not accept
my apology, so I can't.

501
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:42,065
Thistle, never lose your friend
who's spending your twenties with you.

502
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,870
I said all kinds of things.

503
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,512
Hi.

504
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,007
I've done nothing but study all my life.

505
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,934
So when something happens,

506
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,686
I try to find
the most logical way to solve it.

507
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,858
I don't want to beat around the bushes.

508
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,768
If you want a divorce,

509
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,607
I can take care of the alimony.

510
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,454
Is that a logical way to solve it?

511
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,742
So the reason you came
all the way here on your day off is money?

512
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,997
Did you know?

513
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,169
He said he will put this house
under your name.

514
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,044
I didn't know.

515
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,304
Yes.

516
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,256
I knew it.

517
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,546
You're not a shameless girl.

518
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,683
You're wise and simple, right?

519
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:04,027
A girl who grew up in a lowly household,
but wise and simple.

520
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,614
My mother-in-law's opinion
of me never changes.

521
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,825
I'd like coffee.

522
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,338
By the way, you really didn't know?

523
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,630
Didn't you think that you two
weren't on the same level?

524
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,724
The marriage wasn't for love, right?

525
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,220
Please stop and go.

526
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,591
We'll talk about it.

527
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,679
You.

528
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,731
I thought you would be able to
handle this marriage.

529
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,479
I chose you.

530
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,980
-Did you forget?
-Mother.

531
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,284
I'm not telling you
to be my daughter-in-law.

532
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,531
I'm just saying

533
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,532
we should make a wiser choice
for everyone.

534
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,919
If you let her be,
then she can live peacefully

535
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,632
by acting like she doesn't know.
Why make things worse?

536
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,053
You two are family.

537
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,931
I'm sick and tired of that word "family."

538
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,513
Eun-joo isn't like you.

539
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,427
She did her best.
She did everything she could.

540
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,684
My conscience can't handle it anymore.

541
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,444
I am going to stop. So give up.

542
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,904
Get up and go.

543
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,873
You should've just come in. Why text me?

544
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,905
Did you get up just now?

545
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,495
I went to bed late.

546
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,127
So why are you here so early?

547
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,089
If it's not a side dish delivery
from Mom, what is it?

548
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,212
Coffee.

549
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,797
Coffee for me too.

550
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,024
You look a bit serious.

551
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,310
Is something wrong?

552
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,766
Eun-hee.

553
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,976
Why?

554
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:07,936
Yesterday,

555
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,321
did you have to come to the office
just because Chan-hyuk was ignoring you?

556
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,530
What are you talking about?

557
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,615
Did he say something?

558
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,739
No, it's just not pleasant to see.

559
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,788
Even if you're friends, that's not right.

560
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,172
That's not Chan-hyuk's house.
It's his company.

561
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,000
I didn't know
he'd be working on the weekend.

562
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,496
His home would be weird too.

563
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,973
You have a guy. Does Chan-hyuk know?

564
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,468
He does. I told him.

565
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,135
Of course, I can tell him.

566
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,009
Did you think I was making
a move on Chan-hyuk

567
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,177
without telling him that I have a guy?

568
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,388
No, that's not itâ¦

569
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,636
Then?

570
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,477
Chan-hyuk and Seo-youngâ¦

571
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,736
They have an unusual relationship.
There's something between them.

572
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,149
You brat. Did you
figure that out just now?

573
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,988
You knew it, and you did that?

574
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,487
Do youâ¦

575
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,947
Do you think men and women
cannot be friends?

576
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,214
Men and women, friends, or whatever.

577
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,500
Chan-hyuk ignored your calls.
He ignored them on purpose.

578
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,495
That's a sign. A sign telling you
to keep the boundaries.

579
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,418
Did you have to ignore that
and barge into the office?

580
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,516
Don't you feel sorry for Chan-hyuk?

581
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,852
You cut ties on your own

582
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,056
and act like you're close to him
on your own.

583
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,147
"Act like I'm close to him?" That's harsh.

584
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,028
You're breaking my heart.

585
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:36,738
I'm asking you to not cross the line.
He's the CEO of the company I work at.

586
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,738
This is how scary a paycheck is.

587
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,583
All right.

588
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,584
I had something
I had to wrap up yesterday.

589
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,501
I'm sorry.

590
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,126
I won't do that again.

591
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,769
I've been seeing him
since I was in elementary,

592
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,309
and I think of him as my
brother and family.

593
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,154
He's not family. I am your sister.
I raised you. I am your family.

594
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,692
How childish.
You can die from childishness.

595
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,777
Ji-woo, you've grown up.

596
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,162
You're a cheapskate, but you bought
pastries to give me advice.

597
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,157
Let's go. I have to go
to Mom and Dad's house, too.

598
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,874
I'm going to go play games.

599
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,384
And I'll be rebellious for a while.
I only sleep at my houseâ¦

600
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,128
Rebellious? Don't even!

601
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,840
You think you're a teenager?

602
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,880
You're being ridiculous, you little kid!

603
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,473
Kid? I told you not to do that!

604
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,548
-Not to do what?
-You're even smaller than me.

605
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,045
-Want to wrestle?
-Come on.

606
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,136
-You littleâ¦
-Try me.

607
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,273
GOLDEN GOOSE MEDIA

608
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,146
Why are you here?

609
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,186
I came here to check something.

610
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,621
What's with those nasty eyes of yours?

611
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:09,253
Because I need
to check something with you.

612
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,421
No one wears a suit
to a blind date these days.

613
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,803
Right, Mom said it's a blind date
to get a fiance.

614
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:20,629
My mother must be seeing
her friends too often after she retired.

615
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,846
Blind date to get a fiance.

616
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,679
A meeting of a man and a woman

617
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,135
checking looks and attitudes
with the intention of getting married.

618
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,057
Wow, I'm totally shocked.

619
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,436
Does Eun-hee know too?

620
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,822
What's the point?

621
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,528
Doesn't she know that you do everything
your parents tell you to do?

622
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,740
You said you're leaving.

623
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,860
Let me get changed and get some rest.

624
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,445
She's your friend, but she knows nothing.

625
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,235
I know a lot more.

626
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,960
I liked her because she knew nothing.

627
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,963
It's in the past tense.

628
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,665
So that means you liked her before.

629
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,934
It means I like her as a friend
who knows nothing.

630
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,471
I have to go home
and report about my blind date.

631
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,477
I'm leaving.

632
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,064
Wait for me.

633
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,323
Don't be too rebellious
and come home early.

634
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,527
Whatever.

635
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,624
The suit and the camera
don't go well together.

636
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,623
That's a prejudice.

637
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,995
Chan-hyuk.

638
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,535
Why are you here?

639
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,166
To play a game. The Wi-Fi works well here.

640
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,058
How come she didn't say goodbye
before she left?

641
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,849
She's waving.
She's saying goodbye with it.

642
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,314
I'm going in.

643
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,818
Looks so dazzling.

644
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,910
-My friend.
-Something happened again at home?

645
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,412
Why? Should something happen?

646
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,285
You aren't nice enough to Ji-woo

647
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,712
to meet him and give him a ride.

648
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,091
Ji-woo must be going through puberty.

649
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,958
He's being rebellious to Mom and me.

650
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,086
And I'm not a nice sister
who can tolerate him being rebellious.

651
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,350
What are you trying to say?

652
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,098
Why aren't you with Mr. Playboy?

653
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,850
and why are you wandering around,
looking horrible?

654
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,443
I've always looked like this.

655
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,059
Your standard must've gotten
higher because of her.

656
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,686
I'm on my way to see him.
Get off the phone.

657
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,701
Bye.

658
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,171
Whatâs wrong with my looks? Damn it.

659
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,803
I chose you.

660
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,465
Did you forget?

661
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,733
{\an8}Then I'll meet with
the pharmaceutical company and see

662
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,979
{\an8}if your thesis was cited
in the patent document.

663
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,191
Okay.

664
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,147
Want to have dinner?

665
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,202
Do you have time?

666
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,275
Oh.

667
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,037
Yes, I do.

668
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,575
Good.

669
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,339
There's someone we will eat dinner with.

670
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,930
This is Patent Attorney Kim Eun-joo.

671
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,273
This is Yoon Tae-hyung, my student.

672
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,689
I didnât think the professor would set up
such an occasion.

673
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,015
I didn't know, either.

674
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,026
I thought she was wrapping
things with our team today.

675
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,699
She always said she doesn't like
how the work was done.

676
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,155
She thinks no one is
good at working except for herself.

677
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,753
She's selfish and immature.

678
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,919
I understand the selfishness
and immaturity of someone successful.

679
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,003
It's not harmful, at least.

680
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,548
You just don't need to be hurt
by straightforward words.

681
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,931
What words can hurt?

682
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,595
"I like you because
you don't flatter people."

683
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,645
It's not obvious that you're poor.

684
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,978
She insults me so brightly,
making it sound like a compliment.

685
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,070
You analyzed my mother the best
among all the people I met.

686
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,333
Mother?

687
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,008
You call a cafe employee

688
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,385
near your house by his name?

689
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,351
Are you jealous?

690
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,942
Would there really be a friend
who carries my sadness

691
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,808
on his or her back?

692
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,395
You.

693
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,619
Get some rest.

694
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,378
Is it hard that my parents
treat you like family?

695
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,086
You want to stop
because of your conscience?

696
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,260
That's not the real reason.

697
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,981
Youâ¦

698
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,136
find me

699
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,651
burdensome.

700
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,201
Because I like you.

701
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,300
Without realizing it,

702
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,347
little by little,

703
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,263
slowlyâ¦

704
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,806
I grew to like you.

705
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,360
I guess that's why I tried so hard.

706
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,088
I realized after saying it.

707
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,131
That was the most useless
and sad confession.

708
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,162
OCTOBER 13, 1982

709
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,161
What am I, a thief?

710
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,132
Why did he ask me to do this?

711
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,172
Over here.

712
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,795
Like this.

713
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,009
But still, it was Dad's favorâ¦

714
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,300
OCTOBER 13, 1982

715
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,137
Jin-sook, over here.

716
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,015
Hi.

717
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,983
Hi.

718
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,025
Wellâ¦

719
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,574
Sang-sik must be out of his mind.

720
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,663
He kept ignoring your calls.

721
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,909
No, I didn't call him more on purpose.

722
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,793
It seems like he's settled down

723
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,668
in a quiet place after work.

724
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,708
Keep going straight.

725
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,431
Miss Sook, did you kiss me?

726
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,556
You haven't changed at all.

727
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:40,435
Let's graduate from marriage now.

728
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,164
JIN-SOOK

729
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,580
I'm at the plant.

730
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,477
You could've asked Ji-woo
to deliver the message.

731
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,150
Why come all the way here?

732
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,528
He doesn't want to.

733
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,359
He told me to call you directly
if I have something to say.

734
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,239
But you don't answer my calls.

735
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,538
You could've texted me.

736
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,078
I'm sorry for coming here.

737
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:33,299
If I need anything, I'll buy it.
Don't worry about it.

738
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,184
Don't buy unnecessary things,

739
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,891
and use the money in it for a few days.

740
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,562
Come back home when I call you.

741
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,227
Are you

742
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,273
telling me to come back home?

743
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,819
Yes.

744
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,494
I decided to leave the house.

745
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,792
The kids think I kicked you out,

746
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,408
and they resent me.

747
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,245
It's hard to be at home.

748
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,710
Why would our kids do that?

749
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,000
I broke your heart

750
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,924
and their hearts to graduate
from marriage suddenly,

751
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,133
so I should leave.

752
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,554
Because you're a good father

753
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,643
who worked hard your whole life
to make money.

754
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:19,763
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

755
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,149
Why should I take this?

756
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,979
Why should I take Eun-joo's bankbook?

757
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,395
Just how many secrets
are you keeping from me?

758
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,414
Are there more secrets for me to find out?

759
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,738
Why are you making me
a bad person to our kids?

760
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,285
Then don't take it.

761
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,828
You're graduating from marriage
but also taking our daughter's money?

762
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,793
You're not that kind of person, Ms. Sook.

763
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,170
Don't you remember this bankbook?

764
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:57,046
You made this bankbook for Eun-joo.

765
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,546
Don't you remember?

766
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,056
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

767
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,567
Your memories aren't back, are they?

768
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,945
I remember everything.

769
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,872
I just didn't know she kept it
without using it.

770
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,161
Give it back to Eun-joo.

771
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,245
This is not a place

772
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,080
for someone to roam around freely.

773
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,915
So donât go anywhere and wait here.

774
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,223
So that's why such a thing happened.

775
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,430
Man-ho!

776
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,772
What?

777
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,626
You don't even take a taxi
because it's expensive.

778
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,458
Don't come all the way here anymore.

779
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,318
Fasten your seat belt.

780
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,294
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY

781
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,255
Is this the first edition?

782
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,902
When did you come?

783
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,947
A while ago.

784
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,622
Did you eat?

785
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,869
I ate two servings of a home-cooked meal.

786
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,116
Where have you been at this hour?

787
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,826
You dressed up like a college student.

788
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,841
It's because you love me!

789
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,672
Why did you come here without telling me?

790
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,178
Are you here to fight me too?

791
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,220
"Too?"

792
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,137
Who fought you, Ms. Sook?

793
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,062
Who was it?

794
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,385
That wretched "Ms. Sook."

795
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,020
Ms. Sook!

796
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,614
Eun-joo's birthday is soon.

797
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,069
Did you think I'd forget?

798
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,740
Mom, by any chanceâ¦

799
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,823
Was Eun-joo born prematurely?

800
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,989
What are you talking about?

801
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,383
Dad asked me to bring this photo to him,

802
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,880
so I came to get it secretly, but I can't.

803
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,174
This photoâ¦

804
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,184
I think the root grew from this.

805
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,966
I can't pull it out.
This is the best place for it to be.

806
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,730
Stop talking nonsense and take it to him.

807
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,272
Want to take jangjorim?

808
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:26,109
He said this was
the day he proposed to you

809
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,742
and held your hand for the first time,

810
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,121
and this photo was taken
to remember it forever.

811
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:42,844
Mom.

812
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,755
Dad said it wrong, right?

813
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:58,135
You said you were already pregnant
with Eun-joo at the time.

814
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,016
She cannot be premature.

815
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,698
You said Eun-joo was born

816
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,365
later than her due date.

817
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,004
Did youâ¦

818
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,753
say it wrong?

819
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,345
Mom.

820
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,678
Tell me what I'm thinking is wrong.

821
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,766
Please.

822
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,604
You must neverâ¦

823
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,773
tell her now.

824
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,687
We shouldn't give any more
burdens to Kim Eun-joo.

825
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,067
She won't be able to handle it.

826
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,829
THE. YOO'S FRUIT SHOP

827
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,052
May 3, 2015.

828
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,758
I gave the bankbook to Eun-joo.

829
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:18,103
I regret depositing 500,000 won per month
instead of 600,000 won per month.

830
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,685
Ms. Sook.

831
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,311
I feel like I'm still dreaming.

832
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,731
One thing is for sure.

833
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:34,025
Family is all I have.

834
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:01,097
Eun-joo's father came.

835
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,027
We should graduate from marriage too.

836
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,898
You just want me to sign up
for life insurance and die, right?

837
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,255
I'm sorry I'm not fit
to be Eun-joo's father.

838
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,551
Do you remember
how you neglected our kids?

839
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,295
Do you remember that?

840
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,485
Iâ¦

841
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:40,873
I remember.

842
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,483
Chan-hyuk.

843
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,024
Iâ¦

844
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,479
hate myself.

845
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,988
Since you confessed your feelings for me,
I should give you an answer.

846
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:20,701
How did you find out about this place?

847
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,781
I've tailed you before.

848
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,117
Is asking every single thing

849
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,621
and being emotional dating?

850
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,123
That's what I liked about you.

851
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,075
To meet you.

852
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,962
I have something to tell you
about your father.

853
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,342
You're my sister
and I'm your younger sister.

854
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,594
Why would I be curious about
those who were never by my side?

855
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:44,101
