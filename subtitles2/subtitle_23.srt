2
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:31,761
It's time to go.

3
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:33,456
Okay.

4
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,553
Jude. Let's go, baby.

5
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:43,856
Shh.

6
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,193
Come on.

7
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:55,889
Hurry.

8
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,833
Mr. Hamilton, we're doing
everything that we can.

9
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,360
I haven't always been good
to her.

10
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:47,761
She doesn't deserve this.

11
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,681
Don't think about that now.

12
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,304
Just, you know, forgive yourself

13
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,024
and be nice to her.

14
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,912
Hey. Are you married?

15
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,201
- No.
- Okay.

16
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,663
Because I was thinking,
my friend, Hank,

17
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,809
he has a small farm in Nebraska.

18
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,953
And he could really use a hand.

19
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:06,416
I don't think that house
has been cleaned

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,625
since we were listening
to The Bee Gees.

21
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:11,665
Hank's not for everybody,
but I think you'd like him.

22
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,609
That's very kind of you, um,

23
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,193
but I couldn't leave my job
or my other job.

24
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,952
- Alice.
- Thank you, though. Thank you.

25
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,640
We need you in there,
not out here.

26
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,081
Bye.

27
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,105
Come on, Alice.

28
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:36,585
It's really all I can do
for you.

29
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,497
I don't mean to be rude but

30
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,512
firing me is all you can do
for me?

31
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,080
That's the conclusion
I've reached, Jeff.

32
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,329
But I haven't done anything.

33
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,929
That's exactly my point.

34
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:48,594
We're trying to sell
some mattresses here,

35
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,800
put some people to sleep.

36
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:53,041
I don't see your contribution.

37
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,992
I just need a little more time
to get the hang of it.

38
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,937
There are many of us who doubt
that would make any difference.

39
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,792
Actually,
I think we're all agreed that

40
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:02,289
you're pretty bad
at just about everything.

41
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:05,040
That... That's not,
that's not true.

42
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:06,760
Name just one thing
you are good at.

43
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,329
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,321
This is so cool.

45
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:35,600
We should keep this.

46
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,705
What if we get a new house?
I want you to have it.

47
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,463
That is very nice of you,

48
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,513
but we don't need it.
We're on vacation.

49
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:43,793
It's great, though.

50
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,136
We got crazy lucky.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,329
It probably fell off a truck or
something, right into our lives.

52
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:53,008
Well, I don't think that it's
gonna fit right into our trunk.

53
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,985
Besides I have to confirm
where we're staying.

54
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,097
We just give it
to someone else then.

55
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,913
Everybody likes a good chair.

56
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:04,041
That's why we're gonna leave it
here for someone else to find.

57
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,577
Where are we now?

58
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,689
Some place you've wanted to go

59
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:11,665
for a long, long, long time.

60
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,040
The mall?

61
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,064
Better!

62
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,976
- Look.
- Not New York.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,887
Yes! That is Manhattan.

64
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,281
But Dad says
we don't like New York.

65
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,801
I've never been to Manhattan,
so, I really wouldn't know.

66
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:28,177
What about school?

67
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,505
New York is going to be
a kind of school for you.

68
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:55,697
So.

69
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,671
I'm tired.

70
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,121
More pancakes?

71
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,297
You've only had 11.

72
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,441
- I gotta go to the office.
- Now?

73
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:09,672
Yeah. I'm in court
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

74
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,937
- So, I will see you on Tuesday?
- Tuesday?

75
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:16,432
- My group. You said you'd go.
- Did I?

76
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,937
I'll be honest.
It's very helpful.

77
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,344
Helps me get through
all those times

78
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:22,224
I have to defend someone
I know is guilty.

79
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,537
And they're found not guilty.

80
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,593
Yes.

81
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,064
So, you forgive them?

82
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,401
I forgive myself.
What's the damage?

83
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,289
- I'll get that.
- Are you sure?

84
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:32,945
Yeah. I invited you
to celebrate.

85
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:33,969
This is true.

86
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,673
All right, goodnight.

87
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,424
Congrats on your first day
as a free man.

88
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,137
Putin gets up at seven or eight.

89
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:54,001
That's right.

90
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:57,040
The time difference
between Moskva and...

91
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:00,272
Excuse me. I just need
to pay my check.

92
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:03,217
Have another drink.
Did your friend leave?

93
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:06,097
- My lawyer.
- Those guys get up so early.

94
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:10,193
I've heard that Putin
sometimes gets up at 4:30 a.m.

95
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:11,537
This is your place?

96
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,665
We are only the advisors.
Timofey is the owner.

97
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,169
The service is terrible.

98
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:18,385
Not as bad as the food.

99
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:19,824
What can I tell you?

100
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,233
Did you try the celery thing?

101
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,601
- Nah.
- It's disgusting.

102
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,265
You don't by any chance
for some reason

103
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,121
play the double bass
balalaika, do you?

104
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,457
Do I look like someone
who plays bass balalaika?

105
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,833
Don't worry.
It's absolutely all right.

106
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:32,785
- Everyone can learn.
- He said no, Timofey!

107
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:34,409
It doesn't hurt to ask.

108
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,161
He ask everyone.

109
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:39,241
Please.

110
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,849
We have a lot on the plate
at the moment,

111
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:52,112
but we care very much
for this house.

112
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:56,304
Timofey, he inherited
everything from his grandfather

113
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,641
who came here
right before the revolution.

114
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:02,001
He did not leave Russia
for political reasons.

115
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:04,881
On the contrary,
he always remained loyal

116
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,305
to whichever regime
was in the Kremlin.

117
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:09,969
But, Timofey,

118
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:11,825
your heart isn't in it.

119
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,761
Please, Sergei.
We've had this conversation.

120
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,673
Many New Yorkers
feel uncomfortable

121
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,521
sitting in these surroundings.

122
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:22,865
Just as an example,

123
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,344
we don't know how
to make that celery dish work.

124
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,841
I know how to run a restaurant.

125
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,761
Interesting.

126
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:33,393
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

127
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:57,393
Hi.

128
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,113
Oh, hi.

129
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:01,553
Can I come in?

130
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:04,457
Uh, eh... Yeah, sure.

131
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,312
Thanks.

132
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,481
So, you're in the city, huh?

133
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,401
Yeah. Just drove down
from Buffalo.

134
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,033
Richard is looking for you.

135
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,681
Um, could you just not
tell him that I'm here?

136
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,657
Why would I lie to him?
He's my son.

137
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,961
Those boys of yours
are my grandsons.

138
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,081
You hardly even know them.

139
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,105
Well, they're never here.

140
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,785
Richard wouldn't let us come.

141
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:33,801
Are they here now?

142
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:38,513
I'll see you.

143
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,161
Next time you come,
you scrub up first. Will you?

144
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:42,897
No.

145
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,977
Want a donut, dear?

146
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,025
We need a place to stay.

147
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,041
Just for a couple of days.
Just me and the boys.

148
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:55,377
I promise they won't be
any trouble.

149
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,520
You had a fight,
you took the car.

150
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:58,577
It's my car.

151
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,825
Where are you going?

152
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,577
Just sightseeing, really.

153
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,041
Me and the boys
have never been anywhere.

154
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:07,857
They need a little,
um, education.

155
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:08,905
Oh!

156
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,761
Classy.

157
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,553
Yeah, so take them
to see the Statue of Liberty

158
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:14,961
and then you go home, okay?

159
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:16,073
Richard needs you.

160
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,441
I have to call him.

161
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:20,849
No, please don't. Please...

162
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:23,145
Don't call him.
You know what'll happen.

163
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:25,745
He's insane.

164
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,265
Hey. Richard is the best cop
I've ever seen.

165
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,545
Now move your hand.
I wanna call my son.

166
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,393
He's started beating up
Anthony now.

167
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,441
I, uh.

168
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,769
I don't

169
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:50,417
I don't wanna come
between you two.

170
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,169
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you stay here.

171
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:54,409
How about some money?

172
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,905
I don't have anyone else.

173
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,857
He took my credit card.

174
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,049
Just a little money for gas
and food for the boys.

175
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,961
I can't do that.

176
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,393
Excuse me?

177
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,417
Do we like them?

178
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,305
I don't know.
Why don't you try it?

179
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,449
They're good for you.

180
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:04,017
What's the black stuff?

181
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,017
Um, they're eggs from a fish.
Just try it, okay?

182
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,801
I want you to be worldly.

183
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:11,889
Fish lay eggs?

184
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:15,473
Yeah.
They're called hors d'oeuvres.

185
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:16,497
Where did you get them at?

186
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:17,801
Mmm, they're from Russia.

187
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,264
- Anna?
- Well.

188
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:31,441
I used to rent out

189
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,321
non-existing apartments,
get the deposit and then

190
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,081
just disappear
off the face of the earth.

191
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,569
And then I got thousands
of dollars out of

192
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,769
sleepless, lonesome people
selling them

193
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,425
fake melatonin on the Internet.

194
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:46,705
So...

195
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,393
Being here makes me able

196
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,921
to look people in the eye again.

197
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,546
The other day, for example,
I went right into a store

198
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,369
and bought a bra.

199
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:58,097
Thank you for sharing that.

200
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,817
It's true. I'm still wearing it.

201
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:01,905
You wanna have a look?

202
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,537
No, I'll pass.

203
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,353
- John Peter?
- No. Maybe some other time.

204
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,505
Marc,

205
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,625
you're new here.

206
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,399
Do you wanna maybe tell us
a little bit about yourself?

207
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:15,057
I don't think Marc knows if this
is the right group for him yet.

208
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,329
Forgiveness?
What could be wrong with that?

209
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:19,057
I'm just here
to support John Peter.

210
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,817
John Peter is a defense attorney

211
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,833
and he has to live with seeing
guilty people go free

212
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:25,137
and having innocent people go to
jail for murder and everything.

213
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:26,673
Thank you very much for that.

214
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:27,793
The works.

215
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,713
He's lost so, so, so,
so many cases.

216
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,281
Thank you, Bonnie.

217
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,585
John Peter, last week,
was it you

218
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,177
who said that you feel
uncomfortable with other people?

219
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,553
You feel like
you don't trust them?

220
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:41,137
People lie. Anyone here
can verify that.

221
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:42,833
Marc, what do you think
about that?

222
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:45,641
They do. Most people
only think about themselves.

223
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:50,441
And food.
They are constantly eating.

224
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:51,953
What about work?

225
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,680
I have a job at a restaurant.

226
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:54,737
That would explain the eating.

227
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:55,761
Touche.

228
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,201
Do you talk to anyone at work?

229
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:58,417
No, it's Russian.

230
00:13:58,441 --> 00:13:59,697
A Russian restaurant?

231
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,360
Receptions, ballroom...

232
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:02,441
- Caviar.
- Caviar.

233
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,129
Cameron?

234
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,370
I think it's unbelievable
how many people suck at dancing.

235
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,641
Right.

236
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,041
- Beer?
- Can't. Work.

237
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,218
- Good?
- Yeah, I can do what I want.

238
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:18,321
I haven't seen anyone
since the day I got the job.

239
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:19,826
Well, if I find myself
a girlfriend,

240
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,713
we will come and have dinner.

241
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,561
Give it a couple of weeks.
The food is still pretty awful.

242
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:27,048
So are the women who would
come to have dinner with me.

243
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,977
This is from the hospital.

244
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,402
If I were you,
I'd wear some gloves.

245
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,170
Where are your gloves?

246
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,760
I forgot 'em, but I'll remember
'em tomorrow.

247
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,042
Are you a temp?

248
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,649
Yeah. I'm hoping, though,
if the week goes well, that I can...

249
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,545
Who sorted this?

250
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,594
- This is just not happening.
- What?

251
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,473
Are you aware
of what could have happened?

252
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,009
How could you?

253
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,889
You just...
You just grabbed Beyonce

254
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:57,073
and threw her in there?

255
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,633
This is his dog.
She's a living person.

256
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,738
Does she look like laundry?

257
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:03,753
A little bit, kinda.

258
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,066
I'm sorry, Jeff.

259
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,584
The dog is fine,
but Rafael just can't seem to forgive you.

260
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,656
So...

261
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:24,977
There's an ATM
just around the corner.

262
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,122
I can't take out
any more cash today.

263
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:28,553
Because my husband...

264
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,569
Um, we've reached our limit
on our card

265
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:34,480
because he bought a car today
on the card.

266
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:38,001
A Toyota actually.
A Toyota Avalon, I think.

267
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,306
Have him come pick you up, then.

268
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:47,378
If the room's empty already,
what's the harm, right?

269
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:50,577
We'll be in and out so quiet and

270
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,697
I'll clean up after us,

271
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,138
I'll make the beds
in the morning.

272
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,601
No one has to know.

273
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,529
What can you lose?

274
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:58,794
I'll lose my job.

275
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,001
Then I'll lose my room.

276
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,089
Then I'll lose my address

277
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,841
and my chance
of getting another job.

278
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,929
Sorry.

279
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:08,073
You just don't look very...

280
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,632
Bankable.

281
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,089
Is this for work?

282
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,969
Soup. Sometimes
it's pretty good.

283
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,425
Are you here to help?

284
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,464
Um... Yeah.

285
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:49,641
I'm not...

286
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,881
This side?

287
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,057
I'm Alice.

288
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,690
You want these for that.

289
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,137
You're gonna get
the hang of it just fine.

290
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,072
Next!

291
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,001
I need your ID, please.

292
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:32,241
I can't give it to you.

293
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,873
Is there a search warrant
out for you?

294
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,241
I just can't give it to you.

295
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,458
What, don't you have family?

296
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,057
I have my two sons.

297
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,338
How do I know they're your kids?

298
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,865
'Cause she's our mom.

299
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,121
Right.

300
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,490
Hi, Glenda.

301
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:47,835
You know, you can call the
police for protection, if you...

302
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,777
So, there is a warrant
out for you?

303
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,801
No.

304
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:55,624
Can we just shower?

305
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,433
We'll be in and out.
Ten minutes tops.

306
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,057
Pass me towels.

307
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,033
Just this once.

308
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,538
Thank you.

309
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:10,386
It's down the hall, okay?
I'll buzz you guys through.

310
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,646
- Thank you.
- Make it quick. Go ahead.

311
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,010
Do you think I
can borrow her computer?

312
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,048
No, you have to wash your hair.

313
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,490
Hello, Alice.

314
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,410
- Hi, Timofey.
- Can I take your coat?

315
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,905
No, I'm wearing my uniform.

316
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,018
Looks nice in here.

317
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,130
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

318
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,785
Long day?

319
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:43,977
It's so peaceful here.

320
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,257
Yeah.

321
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:49,554
I'm just gonna have my usual.
Just a small size.

322
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,578
<i>Spasiba.</i>

323
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,681
Alice is a regular.

324
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,601
She's always alone.

325
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,681
For a while I assumed
she was a manicurist,

326
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,986
which I understand can be quite
demanding in this neighborhood,

327
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,986
but no, she has a totally
different job. Totally.

328
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,690
A nurse.

329
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,666
The consomme of the day,

330
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,458
- just don't make those again.
- Okay.

331
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:15,570
Perhaps soup is out
of our league.

332
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:18,897
I usually just tell people that we're
out of everything except for the caviar.

333
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,744
People like it and you can't go
wrong, it's straight out of a can.

334
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:23,697
Can you just stay out
of the kitchen, please?

335
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,713
Sorry, yeah.

336
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,529
Small size caviar, three
pancakes, no lemon, please.

337
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,802
Oh, by the way,
I think my grandfather left

338
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:33,458
a couple of interesting
champagne coolers

339
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,313
in your apartment. You could
take them down here

340
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:37,394
if you need cabinet space
up there for the...

341
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:40,008
For the clothes you don't
really seem to have.

342
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,646
Wow!

343
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,753
Now, read, okay?

344
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,130
I don't like to read.

345
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,137
I know. You gotta try.
I'll be back really soon.

346
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,161
Be quiet, okay?

347
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:16,978
Stay where you are.

348
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,330
How did that work out for you?

349
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,218
Oh, nothing worked for me.

350
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:29,586
Let me know if I can help you
with something else. I'm Stella.

351
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,792
Thank you.

352
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,746
Here. Food.

353
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,490
Come on, Anthony.
It's time to get up.

354
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:16,234
Where's Jude?

355
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:18,897
He's not here?

356
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,978
He was here before.

357
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,386
How long have you been sleeping?

358
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,954
I wasn't sleeping.

359
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,257
Why do you look like a spy?

360
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,946
I told you
to stay where you were.

361
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,488
Jude!

362
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:32,304
Jude!

363
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:33,328
Come on.

364
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,746
He probably went
back to the car.

365
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,402
He won't remember
where we parked.

366
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,601
Maybe he went up to a cop.

367
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,881
I told him he can't do that.

368
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:49,930
Jude!

369
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:51,946
Jude!

370
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:54,665
Jude!

371
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,402
Mom!

372
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:05,546
- Anthony.
- Mom, Jude!

373
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,561
Mom, hi!

374
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,866
You must be out of your mind.

375
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,690
We almost had to call
the fire department.

376
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:17,906
That would have been great.

377
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,698
Or the police. Can you imagine?

378
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:21,426
I could have lost you.

379
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,072
I wanna see more of Manhattan
while I'm here.

380
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,146
You will. We're not going home.

381
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,490
I want some food.

382
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,322
Some Russian food.

383
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:32,210
Not right now.

384
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,842
Some hors d'oeuvres, please.

385
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,665
I'm thinking those little eggs.

386
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,066
I said not right now.

387
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,002
We're never going back, right?

388
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,474
No, honey, we're on vacation.

389
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:44,817
- Promise?
- Yes.

390
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:45,866
Get in the car.

391
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,994
Listen.

392
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,106
Where are we?

393
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:49,928
It's real.

394
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,801
It must be coming
from a concert hall.

395
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:59,666
What's that?

396
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,650
It's a theater

397
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,250
but only with music.

398
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:05,457
So what do you look at?

399
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,849
I think people
mostly just close their eyes.

400
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,682
It's back through there

401
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,274
and up the stairs.

402
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:51,250
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. It's my accent.

403
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:53,553
The ladies' room is back

404
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,473
through there and up the stairs

405
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,065
and is, uh

406
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:59,274
"badabing" the correct word?

407
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,642
I think so.

408
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:03,986
Thank you.

409
00:25:50,954 --> 00:25:52,178
More?

410
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:53,610
Thank you.

411
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,450
You weren't here
for the dinner, were you?

412
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:03,537
No, I had to work late.

413
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,266
I'm an interior decorator.

414
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,890
I do hotels, so...

415
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,258
You know, mostly bedrooms.

416
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,722
- Bedrooms?
- Mmm.

417
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,402
Are you part of the family?

418
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:18,794
Um, yes.

419
00:26:21,418 --> 00:26:22,674
I'm the aunt.

420
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:23,698
The aunt?

421
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,089
This is a silver anniversary.

422
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,362
Well, Glenda and Dave...

423
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,994
They got married so young.

424
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:32,818
- Glenda and Dave?
- Mmm-hmm.

425
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,218
I thought they were Russian.

426
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,698
The parents gave them
American names.

427
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,344
But, you know,
we love them to pieces anyway.

428
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,346
Ah, babushka, there you are!

429
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,842
It's those ones over there.

430
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,473
Of course.

431
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,522
Thank you.

432
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:10,482
Bye-bye.

433
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,594
What are you doing up there?
Come on down. Come on.

434
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,714
Where were you?

435
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:36,274
Just at a party.
It wasn't fun. Come on.

436
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,002
Was Dad there?

437
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,378
No, honey, he can't find us.

438
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:41,587
It's too big a city. Let's go.

439
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,050
Do we have any food?

440
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,930
What were you doing up there?
Was it the music?

441
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:49,970
I couldn't sleep.
Do we have any food?

442
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:51,914
I'll find something.
Let's get in.

443
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,946
<i>What do other people do?</i>

444
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,594
Where do they go?

445
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:23,146
Probably sleep on someone's

446
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:25,610
fold-out bed.

447
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:29,098
Maybe they go to their family.

448
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,105
Folks...

449
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:38,026
Yeah. Other people have folks.
We don't.

450
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,994
Dad.

451
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:44,426
I hate him.

452
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,298
Once he made me hit Jude.

453
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:50,953
Hard.

454
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:54,410
Otherwise he'd beat us both up.

455
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:57,162
So I did it.

456
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:01,898
I hit Jude a lot of times.

457
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:06,474
It's not your fault.

458
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,754
Hey, um... Hey.

459
00:29:52,778 --> 00:29:54,578
I'm sorry I keep pestering you.

460
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:56,274
You didn't have to do that.

461
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:58,354
I'm not even a psychologist.

462
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:01,105
It's fine. I'm just here
to keep John Peter company.

463
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:03,122
You are terrific.

464
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:04,882
Seriously. I know

465
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:09,234
I for one would be toast
if it wasn't for this and you.

466
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,665
She's very good, Marc.
You can talk to her.

467
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:13,162
You don't have to talk to me.

468
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:19,434
Tell her.

469
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:23,314
It was his brother.

470
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,170
They worked
at a restaurant together.

471
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:29,234
His brother was a drug addict
and a dealer. Um

472
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:32,307
Marc tried in vain
to get him out of that stuff,

473
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,034
but his brother just

474
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:37,171
kept on doing bad stuff
with very bad people.

475
00:30:37,195 --> 00:30:39,634
One day the police
raided their restaurant.

476
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:41,449
Judge gave him eight years.

477
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,378
Marc didn't want to appeal.

478
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:44,714
You were his attorney?

479
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,683
John Peter got me out
after four years.

480
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:52,274
My brother died of an overdose

481
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,858
after I'd been in prison
for two years.

482
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,090
I ran the kitchen there.

483
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,754
I'm completely over it now.

484
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,634
Right.

485
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:11,722
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I've gotta get to my other job.

486
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,130
Yeah. Um...

487
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:15,634
You want us to walk you
to the subway?

488
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:17,106
Maybe another time.

489
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,411
I think I'd like that.

490
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,249
We should go.

491
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,515
Just ten more minutes.
I just wanna check something.

492
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,985
We gotta get back to the car.

493
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:42,122
Next time. Let's go. Come on.

494
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:45,682
Why?

495
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,218
Because...

496
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,834
The bigger the city,
the more parking tickets you get.

497
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:54,963
What is it you keep doing
on that computer?

498
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:57,811
Nothing.
Don't worry about it, Mom.

499
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,218
Where are we going?

500
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:00,555
Sightseeing.

501
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:06,834
Sometimes I see people
that look like Dad.

502
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,227
I know, honey,
but it's just the uniforms.

503
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:13,267
Can he find us when
we get parking tickets?

504
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,762
Not in New York.

505
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:17,931
Wait a minute.

506
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:23,595
This is where we parked, right?

507
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,539
Yeah. Where's the car?

508
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,849
Promise we won't go home?

509
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:35,730
Yeah.

510
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,203
It's just the parking tickets.

511
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:39,634
They can take the car

512
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,107
and put it in a lot somewhere.

513
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:41,938
Can we get it back?

514
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,019
- It's in your dad's name.
- Mmm.

515
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:45,747
Well, when you live in New York

516
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:47,539
you don't really
want a car, so...

517
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,322
That is exactly what I thought.

518
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:51,242
I'm cold.

519
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:53,842
Hey, guess what?

520
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:55,507
I've got a surprise for you.

521
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:56,818
What is it?

522
00:32:56,842 --> 00:33:00,265
A surprise. Come on,
come on, come on!

523
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,178
Well, I think we can just
sit down, don't you?

524
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:28,618
Mmm.

525
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,002
I think they've forgotten us.

526
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,081
It's a pity
the service is so bad

527
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,906
since the food
is so delicious, huh?

528
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,242
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

529
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,875
I don't think
I'm hungry anymore. Are you?

530
00:33:53,995 --> 00:33:55,723
No, not really.

531
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:57,258
Not really.

532
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:05,866
God, I'm so glad
you're all right.

533
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:08,713
I'll buy you dinner.

534
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:16,658
How did you find us?

535
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,987
I'm a cop. I've got friends.

536
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:22,249
Boys, what can I get you?

537
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:23,762
Hmm?

538
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,882
Clara...

539
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,467
Something sweet and sour?

540
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,002
S...

541
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:35,634
Soda... Soda.

542
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,099
Soda, good, yeah. Jude?

543
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,666
Thank you.

544
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,690
Here you are, sir.

545
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:44,362
- Thanks.
- For you, sir.

546
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:48,499
Can I go to the bathroom?

547
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,993
It's down the hall.

548
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:55,155
Sure.

549
00:34:58,187 --> 00:34:59,689
This is for you.

550
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,195
Thank you.

551
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:06,675
Please...

552
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,362
Please come home.

553
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:12,266
It's been a long time now,
you've made your point.

554
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,114
I'll forgive you.
Just come home.

555
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,826
We need each other, right?

556
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,633
I just need a few more days.

557
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,979
You know I can't give you that.

558
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:26,187
The boys need their father.

559
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:28,947
Oh!

560
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:31,731
I... I should... Can I?

561
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,394
Yeah.

562
00:35:33,418 --> 00:35:35,282
- Come on.
- Sorry.

563
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,306
It's okay.

564
00:35:37,098 --> 00:35:38,122
Come on.

565
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,283
Here you go.

566
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,211
Mom! Mom! Over here.

567
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:54,027
Go!

568
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:58,731
Come on!

569
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,674
Hey.

570
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:17,074
Thanks.

571
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:18,354
Thank you, sir.

572
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,466
No problem.

573
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,787
- There you go.
- Thank you.

574
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:25,515
Thank you.

575
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:36,690
Hey. Do you need something?

576
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:37,714
Jude.

577
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:40,722
Thank you. Say thank you.

578
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:42,731
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

579
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,249
Are we still on vacation?

580
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:49,129
Not so much. No.

581
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,219
Are we homeless?

582
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:54,347
We are no more homeless
than anyone else here.

583
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,075
Are you homeless?

584
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:00,649
Jude.

585
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:03,851
Oh.

586
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,699
Hey.

587
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,275
Hey, Will.

588
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,683
I've been trying to reach you.

589
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,025
Yeah...

590
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,275
Don't you have a phone?

591
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:17,387
I lost it.

592
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,729
That's not true.

593
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:23,314
It was on top of the toaster
and then it slipped inside.

594
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,802
And then I turned on the
toaster and so I melted it.

595
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:28,555
Is that why the power
went off last week?

596
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:31,667
Could be.

597
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:33,363
I was in the middle
of drying my hair.

598
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:34,323
Looks nice.

599
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:36,339
And the whole building's
complained. And, Jeff,

600
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:38,291
you're four months behind
with the rent.

601
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:39,315
I know.

602
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:40,938
When's the next time
you get paid?

603
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:42,793
Ahh...

604
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,674
Well, then that'll be
the next time I get paid.

605
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,987
Well, that makes sense.

606
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:49,651
Look, I'm gonna need those keys.

607
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,795
I've got new people
coming in at 6:00.

608
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,139
I can only give you an hour.

609
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:54,546
Why didn't you call me?

610
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,570
Your phone melted.

611
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:02,226
But this is my apartment.

612
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,250
No, it's not.

613
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:07,187
That's my bed.

614
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:08,331
Not really.

615
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:10,602
That's my blanket.

616
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:15,187
And the picture on the wall,

617
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,483
and the magazine and my shoes.

618
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:22,283
That's my yellow toothbrush.

619
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,139
Male African American,
early 50s.

620
00:38:57,163 --> 00:38:58,899
We don't think
he has an address.

621
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:00,659
Fractured skull,
partial spinal fracture.

622
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:01,897
We're gonna take care of you.

623
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,595
Can I get some
blood work and a second IV?

624
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:05,833
I need one liter of bolus.

625
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:09,331
I've got no pulse.
He's coding. One amp of Epi.

626
00:39:09,355 --> 00:39:10,355
I'll get it.

627
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,755
- You're good?
- Yeah, I'm good, man. Thanks.

628
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,851
Sir?

629
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,283
Come on, we gotta get him up.

630
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:01,395
Come with us.
We're here to help.

631
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,179
I don't need any help.

632
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:05,395
I got you.

633
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:06,418
It's cold.

634
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:07,795
Hold on.

635
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:08,907
Have you done any drugs?

636
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:11,147
Can you remember?

637
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:13,258
I don't do drugs.

638
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,851
I'm just cold!

639
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,395
Ah, I'm just cold!

640
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:41,675
Why are you wearing that dress?

641
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:44,811
I work here.

642
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:47,435
It's my day job.

643
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,475
I'm not dead, am I?

644
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,795
They got you just in time.

645
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:07,795
Thank you.

646
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,979
Would you like me
to take those for you?

647
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,291
Sorry?

648
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,011
The sandwiches.

649
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,474
No, thank you.

650
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:54,443
I'll see you out.

651
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,491
I used to work

652
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,146
when I was about 17

653
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:10,923
in a place called
Curtis' Curtains.

654
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:14,091
They made some really
beautiful things.

655
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:15,915
Drapes.

656
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,707
Then...

657
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,090
Curtis

658
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,578
thought I was stealing,

659
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,427
which I wasn't.

660
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:36,523
I just made a mistake
with the computer.

661
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:38,931
Did he say he was sorry?

662
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:40,883
No.

663
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:42,859
He didn't. He called the police.

664
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,675
Two policemen came.

665
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,682
And one of them stayed.

666
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:51,243
That was your father.

667
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:53,482
In his uniform.

668
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:56,434
He didn't arrest me.

669
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,251
He just asked me on a date.

670
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,915
And we got married not long
after that and then you came

671
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:06,475
and.

672
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,154
I never needed a new job.

673
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:14,674
What if he finds us again?

674
00:43:14,698 --> 00:43:16,491
He is a police officer.

675
00:43:17,355 --> 00:43:19,211
And you've been stealing.

676
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:22,803
What do you know about it?

677
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:25,842
Mom... Prada shoes.

678
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:28,531
Those weren't Prada.
Those were Florsheim.

679
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:31,635
And they were suddenly just
there instead of my old ones.

680
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,154
I never steal from anyone
it will matter to.

681
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,315
You just deserve the best.

682
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:42,411
You deserve to be educated.

683
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:49,099
You should look smart.
That way you'll become smart.

684
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:50,835
Yeah.

685
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:03,243
Would you like a pair of these?

686
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:04,843
Yeah, uh...

687
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,283
Don't you have any?

688
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:10,763
I probably had some mittens
when I was a kid. I don't know.

689
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:16,523
Maybe you can wait to finish
until it stops snowing.

690
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:18,546
Yeah, uh

691
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,259
I was gonna finish up real
quick and then I'll be done.

692
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:24,467
It's amazing how quickly you've
gotten the hang of everything.

693
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:25,780
You think so?

694
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:28,203
Yeah. Forgiveness is here.
I gotta head off.

695
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:38,483
- Let's pencil out that.
- It's so cold in here.

696
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:39,731
- Okay.
- It's so cold in here.

697
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:40,755
No ice. I'm sorry.

698
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:43,506
Our trays are 20 years old.

699
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,531
Never any ice.

700
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:46,187
Okay, so let's start.

701
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:50,995
Lloyd?

702
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:53,906
You know, I could bring in some
ice cube trays from home next time.

703
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,723
Five or six of them.
I remember that suggestion we had

704
00:44:56,747 --> 00:44:58,035
that you should
love thy neighbor

705
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:01,300
before your neighbor
loves you, uh,

706
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,155
whatever that is.

707
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:04,275
Bonnie.

708
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:05,811
Shouldn't I just go ahead
and say the phrase correctly?

709
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,635
No.

710
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:09,771
Is there still
nobody you like, Marc?

711
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:12,531
No.

712
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:14,740
Come on, Marc.

713
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:17,963
You and me, we're kind of
friends, aren't we?

714
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:20,211
You don't count.

715
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:21,356
Obviously not.

716
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:29,682
Some weeks ago,

717
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:30,956
in the restaurant,

718
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,355
there was a...

719
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,403
A woman.

720
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,130
She...

721
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,019
No.

722
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:46,002
Great. Now everything
falls in place.

723
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,155
Shh.

724
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,947
What about you, Bonnie?

725
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:51,651
Did you get manage to get through
the week without hitting your dog?

726
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,707
I think that one's open.

727
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:56,651
But Mom doesn't like churches.

728
00:45:57,707 --> 00:45:59,305
But it's warm.

729
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:11,723
Like I said, man,
nobody expects you to open up.

730
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:13,228
Me neither.

731
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:29,075
Oh! I'm just about
to close the church.

732
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,995
Can we just stay for a
couple of minutes to warm up?

733
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:33,906
I'm so sorry, I've got to get
to my other job at the hospital.

734
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,219
Is there a library nearby?

735
00:46:35,243 --> 00:46:37,132
There is, but that's about
to close too.

736
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:40,972
You guys don't have
anywhere else to go, do you?

737
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:42,860
No, we don't.

738
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:47,379
- There's a fold-up bed.
- Anthony!

739
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,579
Perhaps you can just stay
in my office tonight.

740
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:53,971
They close the doors
but, uh, Jeff, the volunteer,

741
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:55,595
he'll be here in the morning
and open up.

742
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,995
Can you help me?

743
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,650
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

744
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:02,003
Okay?

745
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:06,314
I'm not supposed to do this.

746
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,571
Thank you so much.

747
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:16,436
Alice,

748
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,155
can you do a 12-hour shift?
I'm understaffed in the morning.

749
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:20,564
Sure.

750
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,268
I figured most of the others got
kids, and no one's waiting for you.

751
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:25,939
Yeah, of course.

752
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,683
Your watch.

753
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:04,588
Jude.

754
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:06,476
Jude?

755
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,810
Jude?

756
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:36,683
Jude!

757
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,020
Come on.

758
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:49,235
Is he dead?

759
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:51,155
He just won't wake up. Come on.

760
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:52,468
- Take his clothes off.
- Anthony, stop it!

761
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:54,835
- I just needed to check his pulse!
- Get away from your brother.

762
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:55,859
Oh, my God.

763
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:57,715
I think he has hypothermia.

764
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:00,268
Come on, baby, wake up. Wake up.

765
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,715
Careful.

766
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,714
Please just leave us alone.

767
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:47,731
Your son's not dead.

768
00:51:47,755 --> 00:51:49,395
There's a chance
he'll still pull through.

769
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:52,435
Can I see him? Where is he?

770
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:53,707
He's sleeping.

771
00:51:56,524 --> 00:51:58,387
Can you just take me back there?

772
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:00,074
We have to wait
for the police first.

773
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:02,699
It's protocol. I'm sorry.

774
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:07,156
We called your father.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

775
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,196
You can't call him!
You can't call him!

776
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,475
Please tell them, please!

777
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:14,996
You can't call them. Please tell
them you can't call the police.

778
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,523
I think they already have.

779
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,411
If they call my husband...

780
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:23,380
If they call him, he will take my kids.
He'll kill them.

781
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:25,203
Do you have any other family?

782
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:27,572
Would you like to just come
back to my office at the church?

783
00:52:27,596 --> 00:52:29,236
No, he'll find us.

784
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,899
We called the ambulance
from there.

785
00:52:30,923 --> 00:52:33,395
Mom, he'll get you arrested.
He'll take Jude.

786
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:35,188
Nobody's gonna take Jude anywhere.
I work here,

787
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:37,196
I'm gonna make sure of that.
Come here.

788
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:40,588
He wouldn't survive it.

789
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:44,692
Where can I take you?
Let me take you somewhere.

790
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,123
Somewhere warm?

791
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,100
He's in good hands.

792
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:55,795
- You'll take care of him?
- Mmm-hmm.

793
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:57,012
You'll make sure he's okay?

794
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,755
We're gonna do everything
we can. All right?

795
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:03,497
Yeah. It's going to be okay.

796
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,284
I've gotta go back
to the hospital.

797
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:14,035
But I thought maybe,
you know, some coffee

798
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:16,523
or an omelet perhaps.

799
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:19,916
Look, I'm gonna
look after your son.

800
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:24,044
You know, if anything
changes, I'll find you.

801
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:30,314
Um, sorry. I'm gonna
be back in a minute.

802
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:11,092
All right, guys. It's late.

803
00:54:11,116 --> 00:54:12,724
We'll finish up tomorrow.

804
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:15,179
Thank you. You did good tonight.

805
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:46,451
Glass?

806
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,748
Sorry. So sorry.

807
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,180
No, it's fine.

808
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,764
You've been sleeping
for a long time.

809
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,163
I'll go in a minute.

810
00:56:58,187 --> 00:57:01,556
Is there anything
I can help you with?

811
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,972
Just please don't tell anyone
that we were here.

812
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,787
Is the boy okay?

813
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:10,604
I have two boys.

814
00:57:12,492 --> 00:57:14,316
The little one...

815
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,236
He's in the hospital.

816
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:25,740
I'm nothing.
I'm just a housewife.

817
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:32,819
One day I came home, and my...

818
00:57:32,843 --> 00:57:36,331
My husband was
beating up my boy,

819
00:57:38,347 --> 00:57:42,036
Anthony, because he'd left
a spoon by the sink.

820
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,844
He'd put him
on the dining room table.

821
00:57:46,956 --> 00:57:48,780
It must have happened before.

822
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,275
The boys had always
wanted to go to the city.

823
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:57,644
We slept in the car.

824
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:03,124
Parked in the alley here
a few times.

825
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,372
I know.

826
00:58:04,396 --> 00:58:06,316
In the beginning, I thought

827
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,740
he'll just do it to me.

828
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,771
The boys would miss him

829
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:16,979
if we left.

830
00:58:17,003 --> 00:58:18,995
Why don't you go to the police?

831
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:20,915
My husband is the police.

832
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:24,244
He has so many friends there,
he'll find us.

833
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,132
Uh, I'm heading home.

834
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:27,987
And if I have to say so myself,

835
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,036
the champagne pyramid
really worked this time.

836
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,060
I thought you were a Russian.

837
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,747
Uh, sorry, yeah,

838
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:35,636
no, I grew up here.

839
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,940
My advisors tell us
to speak with an accent

840
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:40,084
for the sake of the guests.
I find it very humiliating,

841
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:43,977
and hands down, my name isn't
Timofey, it's just Tim Mortimer.

842
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,748
For what it's worth,
Irina in the coat check,

843
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:51,027
she isn't Russian either.

844
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:52,243
Her name is Doris.
She's from Newark.

845
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:55,530
Not now. Just, just go, please.

846
00:58:58,891 --> 00:58:59,988
I'm so sorry.

847
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:01,196
He's nice.

848
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:03,404
Is he?

849
00:59:04,012 --> 00:59:05,449
Where were you?

850
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:17,900
Thank you.

851
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,556
We won't bother you again.

852
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:38,996
Bathroom?

853
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,595
Here we go.

854
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,316
Yeah. We should wash up.

855
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,090
Hey, Sid.
Can I get you a sweater?

856
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:48,748
Sorry.

857
00:59:49,644 --> 00:59:51,732
Is that okay?

858
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,556
How about some socks?

859
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,860
Thanks a lot.

860
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:58,901
Hey.

861
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:00,659
You guys need anything?

862
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:02,284
I'll tell Alice you were here.

863
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:11,764
Lady? Is this your son?

864
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:13,972
He was downstairs
in one of those stalls.

865
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:16,780
He was crying so hard
I had to break the door.

866
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,556
Is this your mom, son?

867
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:22,540
Is she sick?

868
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,196
Is there anything
I can do for you?

869
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,467
No, thank you.

870
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,540
Maybe I could
get you a cigarette?

871
01:00:31,147 --> 01:00:32,236
No.

872
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,108
Lady! Lady!

873
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:39,636
Lady, I'm trying to help you.

874
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,772
You're looking at me
like I'm dirt.

875
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,340
You're no better than me.

876
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:46,220
I've got children, too.

877
01:00:48,236 --> 01:00:49,356
I had a home.

878
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:51,605
I had insurance!

879
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:52,980
Bill!

880
01:00:53,004 --> 01:00:54,581
I had a job! I had a life, lady!

881
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:57,108
Hey! Hey, hey, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

882
01:00:57,132 --> 01:00:59,252
- She's not looking at me.
- Bill, Bill, all right...

883
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:00,276
She's not looking at me.

884
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,803
- Bill, calm down. Calm down.
- She doesn't see me!

885
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:04,692
She doesn't see me, Jeff.

886
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:07,380
I see you. Calm down.

887
01:01:07,404 --> 01:01:09,427
Okay.

888
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,883
She just needs to be left alone.

889
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:19,027
Please, Mom,
please just open your eyes.

890
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,996
Just open your eyes, please!

891
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:27,914
Don't give up, Mom.
Please don't give up.

892
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,644
I don't care about the rules.
I'm his dad.

893
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:48,180
I'm sorry,
it's because of the circumstances.

894
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,716
I know, but he needs me.

895
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,604
I'm sorry, he's not my patient.

896
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,045
I can't just wait here for days.

897
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,636
I have to see my son now!

898
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,300
Do something, will you?

899
01:01:57,324 --> 01:01:58,643
As far as I know,

900
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,821
your son has had a shock,

901
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:03,027
but he's better now,
and I have an emergency.

902
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:04,403
I'll have someone look into it.

903
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:06,124
So, please, just stay
right here.

904
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,074
Can you grab that?

905
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:32,076
Hello, Alice.

906
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:54,284
Look...

907
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,221
You can stay at my place.

908
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:04,364
It's in the top floor
of the building where I work.

909
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:13,964
Okay.

910
01:03:19,373 --> 01:03:20,940
Come on.

911
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:24,173
Come on.

912
01:03:40,653 --> 01:03:42,260
There's a bedroom over there.

913
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,204
I usually sleep in here anyway.

914
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,748
Here are the keys.

915
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:53,004
Thank you.

916
01:03:54,924 --> 01:03:56,428
Is there a computer?

917
01:03:57,228 --> 01:03:58,380
You can use mine.

918
01:04:01,484 --> 01:04:03,252
Where are your normal things?

919
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:05,164
I don't really have any things.

920
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:07,851
Everything was just here.

921
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:15,700
I'll show you
where you can sleep.

922
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:18,005
Don't touch her!
Leave her alone!

923
01:04:18,029 --> 01:04:19,029
Anthony! Anthony, stop!

924
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:20,757
Stay away from my family!

925
01:04:20,781 --> 01:04:22,292
- He's not gonna hurt us.
- Done.

926
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,436
Anthony.

927
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,100
Leave us alone.

928
01:04:26,124 --> 01:04:28,493
Leave us... Alone.

929
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:42,996
Look, it's better than sleeping

930
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,258
under the piano.

931
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:02,571
Are you cold?

932
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:06,284
Sit here.

933
01:05:14,188 --> 01:05:16,461
You don't like it here, do you?

934
01:05:18,573 --> 01:05:19,916
I like it.

935
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:27,180
I just don't think
it's for me anymore.

936
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:36,525
I'll be right back.

937
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:42,132
Hello, Alice!

938
01:05:42,156 --> 01:05:43,221
Hi, Timofey.

939
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:44,149
Can I take your coat?

940
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,229
No, I've got my uniform on.
I mean, um...

941
01:05:46,253 --> 01:05:48,309
You don't have to
put on a Russian accent.

942
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,740
I'm an ER nurse.
I've seen everything.

943
01:05:50,764 --> 01:05:54,484
Long day, short boyfriend.

944
01:05:54,508 --> 01:05:57,427
Yeah, this is Jude,
he's a patient at my hospital.

945
01:05:57,451 --> 01:05:59,220
I'm hoping that I might
find his mom here.

946
01:05:59,244 --> 01:06:03,252
Well, most of our guests
arrive quite late.

947
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:06,324
This is a first-class restaurant
now, it's not Starbucks.

948
01:06:06,348 --> 01:06:07,987
I know, but Marc, your manager,

949
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:09,716
I talked to him earlier,
and I think

950
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,764
she might be hiding here
with her other son.

951
01:06:11,788 --> 01:06:13,780
- She has two sons?
- Yeah.

952
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:16,821
So the bigger one is not an only child?
That's a relief,

953
01:06:16,845 --> 01:06:18,580
because they can be
absolutely dreadful.

954
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:19,637
So she's here.

955
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:23,220
In confidence?
Try the top floor.

956
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:24,340
You have to go
through the kitchen.

957
01:06:24,364 --> 01:06:25,620
Can you call her
and have her come down

958
01:06:25,644 --> 01:06:26,645
because I have to get back
to the hospital

959
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:28,044
and discharge him?

960
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:30,293
Okay.

961
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:31,500
- Yeah? Thank you.
- Yeah.

962
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,140
Would you like to, uh,

963
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:43,404
see the menu?

964
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:50,317
Would you like me
to find your mother?

965
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:07,347
Oh! I'm sorry.

966
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:08,307
Jeff.

967
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:11,477
I was just... I was just here

968
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:14,293
in case they came back.

969
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:15,533
Keep a lookout.

970
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:17,907
Is the kid all right?

971
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:20,908
Yeah, he's okay.
I got him discharged.

972
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:24,173
Is he with his mom?

973
01:07:24,684 --> 01:07:25,901
Yeah.

974
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,828
Jeff, are you hungry?

975
01:07:33,837 --> 01:07:35,211
I could eat.

976
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:39,437
Please say something.

977
01:07:42,253 --> 01:07:45,300
I know you don't wanna
talk to anyone.

978
01:07:45,324 --> 01:07:47,244
But maybe you could talk to me.

979
01:08:04,172 --> 01:08:06,293
You know, my parents gave me
this wristwatch

980
01:08:06,317 --> 01:08:07,827
when I graduated.

981
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:08,820
My dad was so proud

982
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:11,253
he went and showed
everyone in the neighborhood.

983
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:12,949
It's pretty.

984
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:15,125
You need it for your job.

985
01:08:15,149 --> 01:08:17,004
Weren't you supposed to
work tonight?

986
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:19,701
Would you like a vodka?

987
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,836
I don't, uh...
I don't have any money.

988
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,581
I'll get it. Can we have
two vodkas?

989
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,947
Uh, sure. Russian Standard?

990
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,093
Then I don't have to
go to the stock room.

991
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:33,708
Sure. Make 'em doubles.

992
01:08:34,157 --> 01:08:35,093
Sure.

993
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:37,269
You don't have anyone
you need to get home to?

994
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,853
Well, not really, no.

995
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:41,556
I...

996
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,437
Six years ago, my parents died
within a year of each other

997
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:51,477
and I'd moved out
to take care of them

998
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:54,581
and took leave from the hospital.
When I came back,

999
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:56,084
my boyfriend
had found someone new.

1000
01:08:56,108 --> 01:08:57,675
Was he sleeping with her?

1001
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,300
Jeff...

1002
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:03,725
Sorry.

1003
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:07,829
So, um, what...

1004
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:09,195
Thank you.

1005
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,212
Well, what about...

1006
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:13,524
What about you then?

1007
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:17,036
I haven't been with anyone since.
Four years now.

1008
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:24,821
I thought people that had jobs
at hospitals had, you know,

1009
01:09:24,845 --> 01:09:28,532
all kinds of things going on.
All those beds.

1010
01:09:28,556 --> 01:09:31,316
Not in my hospital.

1011
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,820
I don't even know
if I'd remember how.

1012
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:35,789
Alice.

1013
01:09:37,325 --> 01:09:40,404
I know I'm not your type of,
you know...

1014
01:09:40,428 --> 01:09:42,261
Person or, you know, whatever,

1015
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:45,013
and you're not really my

1016
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:47,316
I don't have a type, really.

1017
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,709
But you've been so kind to me,

1018
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:53,549
I'd be happy, you know...

1019
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:56,629
You know, to...

1020
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:59,573
Just once or twice,
you know, so you got the...

1021
01:09:59,597 --> 01:10:03,027
So you found
your way back to it.

1022
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:06,581
An afternoon when the children's
orchestra is gone or something.

1023
01:10:06,605 --> 01:10:09,845
Are you thinking
in the music room?

1024
01:10:09,869 --> 01:10:11,117
On the piano?

1025
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,395
No, I thought we could put
some cushions on the floor.

1026
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:21,236
No, that's okay, but I...
Thank you, though.

1027
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,597
Yeah. It's the least I can do.

1028
01:10:34,668 --> 01:10:37,077
I'm not gonna
go to work tomorrow.

1029
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,741
How come?

1030
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:41,037
I'm just not good
with people anymore, Jeff.

1031
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:46,228
Yes, you are.

1032
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:48,013
The Forgiveness group,
you help those people.

1033
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:52,021
They help themselves.

1034
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:53,493
You're kind to them.

1035
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,213
You are kind to them.

1036
01:10:57,197 --> 01:10:59,148
Even when they're not.

1037
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:07,213
I'm not someone people
get close to.

1038
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:11,372
I'm no one's <i>numero uno.</i>

1039
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:16,875
Is that Italian?

1040
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:20,781
Yeah.

1041
01:11:24,749 --> 01:11:25,749
Bye.

1042
01:11:49,197 --> 01:11:50,869
Hi.

1043
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:52,364
Hey.

1044
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:55,925
I thought you were sleeping.

1045
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,397
The boys are.

1046
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:58,508
How is Jude?

1047
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:01,581
The same.

1048
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,133
Anthony was
on your computer all day.

1049
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:07,157
Yeah.

1050
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,765
Would you like to go out?

1051
01:12:11,789 --> 01:12:12,788
Now?

1052
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:15,117
Yeah. Just for a walk.

1053
01:12:15,757 --> 01:12:17,397
Kids are safe.

1054
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:18,621
You must feel trapped in here.

1055
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:23,565
I can't.
Anthony gets nightmares.

1056
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:26,221
Besides, I like it in here.

1057
01:12:28,268 --> 01:12:29,549
This isn't a prison.

1058
01:12:30,925 --> 01:12:31,949
No, it's not.

1059
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:37,549
If we were going to go out,
where would we go?

1060
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:40,781
Where would you like to go?

1061
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,653
Hmm, not too far.

1062
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:52,117
I would take you quickly
to Canal Street.

1063
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,956
We would cross that,
and then we'd slow down.

1064
01:12:57,037 --> 01:12:59,596
When we'd reached
West Village, I.

1065
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:05,684
I think I would have waited
so long for you to take my hand

1066
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:08,396
that I would try to take yours.

1067
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,381
Hmm.

1068
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:24,628
Forgiveness, is that you?

1069
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:27,733
You know, it's not on today,
but, um

1070
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:29,365
I have a leaflet here.

1071
01:13:29,389 --> 01:13:30,741
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

1072
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:33,876
I'm looking for my son.
Jude Brand?

1073
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,269
The hospital told me he's gone.
You're Alice, right?

1074
01:13:39,277 --> 01:13:43,157
Uh, there's a children's
orchestra on Thursdays.

1075
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,181
My son doesn't play.

1076
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:48,269
I'm looking for my other son,
too, Anthony.

1077
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:50,605
And my wife.

1078
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:54,837
You work in that emergency
ward, don't you?

1079
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:57,557
They say his mom must have
picked him up. Did you see them?

1080
01:13:57,581 --> 01:13:58,701
No.

1081
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:03,149
I mean... I don't know.
I don't know.

1082
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:05,941
I don't think
you should lie to me.

1083
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:07,213
Why would I lie?

1084
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,389
This is a church.

1085
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:13,269
Would you like me to call
the police for you?

1086
01:14:13,293 --> 01:14:15,629
No, no, no, I don't think
you should.

1087
01:14:17,773 --> 01:14:19,637
I love my wife.

1088
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:21,292
I love my sons.

1089
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,196
I don't think you understand
what love is.

1090
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:28,268
I don't think anybody loves you.

1091
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:44,629
Okay, you're good.

1092
01:14:44,653 --> 01:14:46,228
You want a mirror?

1093
01:14:46,252 --> 01:14:47,413
No, I'm okay.

1094
01:14:47,437 --> 01:14:50,068
- Good.
- Thanks.

1095
01:14:50,092 --> 01:14:52,237
You want me
to cut your hair, too?

1096
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:00,757
Mom?

1097
01:15:00,781 --> 01:15:02,901
Mmm-hmm?

1098
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:04,813
What will it take
for us to go home?

1099
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:07,541
That Dad goes to jail?

1100
01:15:07,565 --> 01:15:09,749
I don't know. I think so.

1101
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:12,629
When we were home,
I was on his computer

1102
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:14,324
and I saw some photos he had.

1103
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:16,341
Just leave it alone.
Read a book or something.

1104
01:15:16,365 --> 01:15:19,445
Mom, it wasn't
just police photos.

1105
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:20,909
People being beat up.

1106
01:15:22,028 --> 01:15:24,213
I've been trying to find them.

1107
01:15:24,237 --> 01:15:26,165
What are you talking about?
That's Marc's computer.

1108
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,597
It's not on here,
they're on Dad's computer.

1109
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:31,701
And, you know, I've been trying
to connect to Dad's computer

1110
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:34,517
but it won't let me,
so I can't show you.

1111
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,109
Like, I can't.

1112
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:39,373
It was horrible.

1113
01:15:40,461 --> 01:15:43,021
I mean, torture and stuff.

1114
01:15:44,268 --> 01:15:45,932
Like what he did to us.

1115
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:17,484
Do you know a lawyer?

1116
01:17:20,812 --> 01:17:21,812
Yeah.

1117
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:30,644
- John Peter, Clara.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1118
01:17:30,668 --> 01:17:31,701
Hi.

1119
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:34,228
It's right through there.
I'll be right with you.

1120
01:17:34,252 --> 01:17:35,468
Thanks.

1121
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,717
Far above your standard.

1122
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:40,213
- She's just a friend.
- You don't have any friends.

1123
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:43,541
Okay, I don't. What's that?

1124
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:45,845
- It's a chair.
- Really? Thank you.

1125
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,924
My assistant found it
on the street,

1126
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,517
and she insists I keep it 'til
she finds a boyfriend.

1127
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,893
She says it's retro.

1128
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,461
So you like her?

1129
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:56,910
She's 26 years old.
She thinks I'm retro, too.

1130
01:17:57,901 --> 01:17:59,766
Plus I...

1131
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,581
May be falling for someone else.

1132
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,541
Ah!

1133
01:18:03,565 --> 01:18:05,453
- Someone I know?
- Yeah.

1134
01:18:07,405 --> 01:18:09,270
Yeah, you'll leave us to it?

1135
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:10,708
Oh,

1136
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:12,077
I'll leave you to it.

1137
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,572
Um, have we met before?

1138
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:18,709
I don't think so.
I'm a friend of Marc's.

1139
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:20,205
Hmm.

1140
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:22,668
Have a seat.

1141
01:18:27,212 --> 01:18:28,397
Well?

1142
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:32,365
So, um...

1143
01:18:39,885 --> 01:18:41,101
Hello.

1144
01:19:10,668 --> 01:19:12,622
Is there an...

1145
01:19:21,037 --> 01:19:23,214
The Plaintiff shall be awarded...

1146
01:19:32,653 --> 01:19:34,189
"His uncle came in..."

1147
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:06,421
Back in five.

1148
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:09,165
Yeah, Phil, just
give me a minute.

1149
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,533
There's a church she goes to.

1150
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:26,261
Leave a message.

1151
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:30,125
Tell her to come see you,
that she's forgiven.

1152
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:35,981
I can't stop that trial.
She's not gonna come see me.

1153
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:40,717
All she wants is money, okay?

1154
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,917
Please, Dad!

1155
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:47,444
I need to take care of my sons.

1156
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:50,228
I need her to stop that lawyer.
It's gone too far.

1157
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:52,237
She has a soft spot for you.

1158
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:55,510
She's unreliable.

1159
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:57,301
She left home when she was a kid

1160
01:20:57,325 --> 01:20:59,254
and now she's leaving you.
She's flaky!

1161
01:20:59,278 --> 01:21:00,757
She's not gonna win.

1162
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:01,942
Please, would you just do it?

1163
01:21:04,974 --> 01:21:06,388
I don't...

1164
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:07,436
Oh!

1165
01:21:08,492 --> 01:21:11,566
Ah! Ah! Stop!

1166
01:21:13,388 --> 01:21:14,388
Ah!

1167
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:32,492
This time was not
quite as hopeless.

1168
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:35,405
See you next Thursday.

1169
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:41,932
It's nice.

1170
01:21:42,925 --> 01:21:44,108
A little orchestra.

1171
01:21:46,957 --> 01:21:47,982
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

1172
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:53,588
You wanna sit down?

1173
01:21:53,612 --> 01:21:54,894
I'm not sure where to begin.

1174
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:01,750
You've been calling in sick
for weeks.

1175
01:22:01,774 --> 01:22:04,085
I know. I'm so, so sorry.

1176
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:05,590
For the love of God,
I am a head nurse.

1177
01:22:05,614 --> 01:22:06,892
You look just fine.

1178
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,749
Is this where the soup kitchen
is run from?

1179
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:18,101
Yeah.

1180
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,269
And the support group.

1181
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,518
Management asked me
to come find you.

1182
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:29,941
It's not just you.
The staff is worn out.

1183
01:22:29,965 --> 01:22:31,925
They can't very well ask us
to turn patients away.

1184
01:22:33,294 --> 01:22:34,894
Can I tell them
you'll be back next week?

1185
01:22:38,254 --> 01:22:40,396
I don't think I can do
that job anymore.

1186
01:22:40,974 --> 01:22:42,581
What will you live on?

1187
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:44,622
I don't know. Soup.

1188
01:22:45,614 --> 01:22:46,614
Sorry.

1189
01:22:47,758 --> 01:22:50,574
Maybe I can ask the hospital

1190
01:22:51,502 --> 01:22:52,845
to fund your group.

1191
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:54,262
Really?

1192
01:22:54,286 --> 01:22:56,788
People are grateful, I hear.

1193
01:22:56,812 --> 01:22:59,286
Except the ones who complain
there's a waiting list.

1194
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,725
There's a waiting list?

1195
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:01,749
Yes.

1196
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:05,621
Um...

1197
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:09,646
Well, will you
put in a good word?

1198
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:13,036
I'll try.

1199
01:23:13,518 --> 01:23:14,638
Thank you.

1200
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:29,934
- Goodnight, Jack.
- Goodnight.

1201
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:47,350
Are you busy?

1202
01:23:47,374 --> 01:23:48,716
No, no. Not at all.

1203
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:51,918
The boys are asleep?

1204
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:54,678
Mmm-hmm.

1205
01:23:54,702 --> 01:23:55,950
Have you heard from John Peter?

1206
01:23:57,934 --> 01:23:59,406
It turns out,

1207
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:04,021
someone found my father-in-law
lying on the floor

1208
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:05,166
of his apartment.

1209
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:06,956
His girlfriend...

1210
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:09,805
She got him to a hospital.

1211
01:24:12,749 --> 01:24:14,702
They think my husband
beat him up,

1212
01:24:15,693 --> 01:24:16,749
so...

1213
01:24:18,669 --> 01:24:21,805
Now they're offering the boys
and me a place to stay.

1214
01:24:23,469 --> 01:24:26,005
So, you're moving?

1215
01:24:26,029 --> 01:24:27,028
Tomorrow.

1216
01:24:27,052 --> 01:24:29,581
We can't go home until after
the case is settled.

1217
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:32,910
Will you be staying in the city?

1218
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:35,829
I don't know.

1219
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:38,445
They won't tell us the address.
It's confidential.

1220
01:25:11,502 --> 01:25:13,165
I have to take care of my boys.

1221
01:25:27,118 --> 01:25:28,396
Follow me.

1222
01:25:39,309 --> 01:25:40,366
Thank you.

1223
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:57,237
Why have you put small spoons
on every single place setting?

1224
01:25:57,261 --> 01:25:58,741
Did you do that in kindergarten

1225
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:01,645
or are you trying to force
people to order caviar?

1226
01:26:02,349 --> 01:26:06,038
Don't you see how rude that is?

1227
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:08,085
Don't you think people should
have a chance to decide

1228
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:09,109
for themselves?

1229
01:26:22,702 --> 01:26:23,702
Sorry.

1230
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:29,334
It's completely up to you
if you want people

1231
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:31,118
to have spoons or not.

1232
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:32,822
I'm sorry.

1233
01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:37,014
Yeah, no, you, you, you may
have a point there.

1234
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:41,814
It's actually a little tactless
to just assume without

1235
01:26:41,838 --> 01:26:44,278
I should have seen that.
Don't I have eyes in my head?

1236
01:26:44,302 --> 01:26:46,478
Look, I'm, I'm,
I'm the one who's sorry.

1237
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:51,534
I'm grateful for what you do
at this place.

1238
01:26:52,429 --> 01:26:53,878
It's going great.

1239
01:26:53,902 --> 01:26:56,085
Again, I prefer
not to discuss anything

1240
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:58,326
that has to do with business.

1241
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:01,069
But I have been more worried
than I realized about

1242
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,453
not being able
to keep the place.

1243
01:27:07,502 --> 01:27:10,348
It shouldn't be a problemovich.

1244
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:17,166
Will she be coming back?

1245
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,038
I don't think so.

1246
01:27:23,982 --> 01:27:24,982
Goodnight.

1247
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:27,918
Can you ask her to?

1248
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:32,236
And the kind little boys?

1249
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:35,566
I don't even know
where they are.

1250
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:56,622
Do you wanna sleep in my bed?

1251
01:27:58,253 --> 01:27:59,502
It's not your bed.

1252
01:28:01,518 --> 01:28:03,213
No, it's not.

1253
01:28:06,062 --> 01:28:07,309
You're nothing like him.

1254
01:28:09,069 --> 01:28:10,222
Neither is Jude.

1255
01:28:12,174 --> 01:28:15,405
Neither of you
have anything bad in you.

1256
01:28:16,462 --> 01:28:17,709
I want to kill him.

1257
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:22,830
If we win this,
he's gonna go to jail,

1258
01:28:24,654 --> 01:28:27,318
I think, for a very long time.

1259
01:28:27,342 --> 01:28:29,870
You're gonna grow up
and you'll forget him.

1260
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:31,917
But what if he wins?

1261
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:37,589
I had no idea how much we owed.

1262
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:39,726
I just put all the bills
in my bowling bag.

1263
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:42,549
Huh. And my wife loves shopping.

1264
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:44,886
I mean, I think we had
100 tea pots in my home

1265
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:46,542
and we mostly just drink coffee.

1266
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:48,470
Uh, she even bought one

1267
01:28:48,494 --> 01:28:50,166
that was made to look like
Saint Peter's Cathedral.

1268
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,574
Can we stay on topic?

1269
01:28:51,598 --> 01:28:52,846
We've got one like that.

1270
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,278
Can we stay on topic, please?

1271
01:28:56,142 --> 01:28:58,134
Right. Uh

1272
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:00,022
I think I'll forgive myself
next Tuesday.

1273
01:29:00,046 --> 01:29:01,806
Yeah, you said
that last Tuesday.

1274
01:29:02,606 --> 01:29:03,606
Who's next?

1275
01:29:07,629 --> 01:29:08,718
John Peter...

1276
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,189
You hardly ever speak.

1277
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:14,133
I'm an attorney.
I'm sworn to confidentiality.

1278
01:29:14,157 --> 01:29:15,414
Not about yourself.

1279
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:16,590
I have no problems.

1280
01:29:17,358 --> 01:29:20,022
Not enough sex, but

1281
01:29:20,046 --> 01:29:22,070
I assume everyone else in this
room shares the same problem.

1282
01:29:22,094 --> 01:29:23,158
Speak for yourself.

1283
01:29:23,182 --> 01:29:26,805
Yeah, Bonnie,
I'm sure you're on fire in bed.

1284
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:28,725
Well, still waters can run deep.

1285
01:29:28,749 --> 01:29:30,798
Very deep, Lloyd.

1286
01:29:31,662 --> 01:29:33,230
Why can't you just be kind?

1287
01:29:34,638 --> 01:29:35,861
Terrible things happen,

1288
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:37,966
and some of you
have nobody to turn to.

1289
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:39,917
But you have strangers.

1290
01:29:41,262 --> 01:29:43,022
Why can't you be more careful?

1291
01:29:44,302 --> 01:29:45,358
More compassionate.

1292
01:29:46,862 --> 01:29:48,022
And you two,

1293
01:29:48,046 --> 01:29:50,965
you sit there and you don't
talk and you take up space.

1294
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:53,941
Well, not you, John Peter.
You've actually been...

1295
01:29:53,965 --> 01:29:55,789
You've been terrific.
You've been very kind.

1296
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:58,253
But the rest of you...

1297
01:30:00,398 --> 01:30:02,253
What gives you the right
to be unkind?

1298
01:30:06,126 --> 01:30:07,125
Shut up, Bonnie.

1299
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:08,149
What?

1300
01:30:15,822 --> 01:30:17,550
That was so helpful!

1301
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,006
John Peter and Marc,
could you stay?

1302
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,254
Firstly, forgive me.

1303
01:30:31,278 --> 01:30:32,437
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1304
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:34,005
There's a waiting list
for the group,

1305
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:36,726
and I hope we're moving
to the hospital.

1306
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,190
So I think you guys
should stop coming.

1307
01:30:39,214 --> 01:30:40,526
Oh. Well.

1308
01:30:41,134 --> 01:30:42,549
I'm only here for his sake.

1309
01:30:42,573 --> 01:30:44,526
I'm only here for his sake
and for you.

1310
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:47,542
Um...

1311
01:30:49,326 --> 01:30:50,326
Ah.

1312
01:30:51,182 --> 01:30:52,918
I'm gonna go for a smoke.

1313
01:30:52,942 --> 01:30:53,997
Good.

1314
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:01,261
In that case, um...

1315
01:31:03,533 --> 01:31:05,493
Are you free to come here
on Sunday night?

1316
01:31:05,517 --> 01:31:08,406
Yes, I am.
Um, any special reason?

1317
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:12,278
No special reason, just now
you're not my client anymore.

1318
01:31:12,302 --> 01:31:13,966
Um, I can invite you to dinner.

1319
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,302
Rock and roll.

1320
01:31:18,254 --> 01:31:20,334
That's the first time I've
ever used that expression.

1321
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,118
Whoo!

1322
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,133
Will Alice be there?

1323
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:07,982
Yes, it was her idea.

1324
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:10,766
And she is going to cook for us.

1325
01:32:12,335 --> 01:32:13,646
Will Marc?

1326
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:16,045
No.

1327
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,631
Come on, you'll sit over here.

1328
01:32:23,598 --> 01:32:25,686
Thank you so much for having us.

1329
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:27,382
The boys were so excited.

1330
01:32:27,406 --> 01:32:30,230
I'm so glad that you came.
Nice to see you.

1331
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:32,438
When everyone is seated,
I'll get some chairs.

1332
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:33,686
Okay.

1333
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,958
They're a little wet, though.

1334
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:37,238
- Hi.
- Hi.

1335
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:39,446
- Oh!
- It's just,

1336
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,716
yeah, I'll...

1337
01:32:43,022 --> 01:32:45,429
Oh, hi. Have you heard anything?

1338
01:32:45,453 --> 01:32:47,798
No, I'm sorry. No word yet.

1339
01:32:47,822 --> 01:32:48,855
- No word?
- I'm sorry.

1340
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:51,350
- You all right, Jeff?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1341
01:32:51,374 --> 01:32:52,877
- Say hi to John Peter.
- Ah!

1342
01:32:53,454 --> 01:32:54,933
Hi. How are you?

1343
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:58,838
So, uh, Jeff
has been cooking all day

1344
01:32:58,862 --> 01:33:00,950
and it looks
incredibly delicious.

1345
01:33:00,974 --> 01:33:01,974
It looks great.

1346
01:33:01,998 --> 01:33:03,606
Which corner,
which corner, which corner?

1347
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:04,981
Any.

1348
01:33:05,005 --> 01:33:09,718
Okay. This one. This got...
This got good potato.

1349
01:33:09,742 --> 01:33:11,277
I've got it, Jeff. I've got it.

1350
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,213
Mmm-mmm.

1351
01:33:17,006 --> 01:33:19,125
- Uh...
- What's wrong?

1352
01:33:19,149 --> 01:33:21,110
Forgive me for being a bit

1353
01:33:21,134 --> 01:33:23,766
gauche, but, uh...

1354
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,070
In case we need to eat
someplace else, um,

1355
01:33:26,094 --> 01:33:27,925
I know a place.

1356
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:28,974
That would be great.

1357
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:31,927
Beautiful, Marc. Beautiful work.

1358
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:34,229
You found a way to make
Russian food delicious.

1359
01:33:34,253 --> 01:33:36,662
This Prince Igor salad,

1360
01:33:36,686 --> 01:33:40,118
is this what Brezhnev ate in
the '80s, the early '80s?

1361
01:33:40,142 --> 01:33:41,238
Shut up. It was delicious.

1362
01:33:41,262 --> 01:33:42,165
I like the caviar.

1363
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:44,118
Oh, guys, it can be
Brezhnev's favorite meal

1364
01:33:44,142 --> 01:33:45,998
and still be delicious.
That was wonderful.

1365
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,311
Anthony, have some more.

1366
01:33:48,335 --> 01:33:52,182
Maybe later. Jeff,
can we get some ice cream?

1367
01:33:52,206 --> 01:33:55,638
Yeah. You want me to go get
it, though? Unless you want to.

1368
01:33:55,662 --> 01:33:58,645
Why don't you hang out,
hang out if you want.

1369
01:33:58,669 --> 01:34:01,037
I mean, you worked
a long day today,

1370
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,318
and

1371
01:34:03,342 --> 01:34:05,013
I got kicked out
of my therapy group

1372
01:34:05,037 --> 01:34:08,206
so I could, uh, I could use
someone to chat with.

1373
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:12,662
So when is your case decided?

1374
01:34:12,686 --> 01:34:14,894
Uh, next week, they think.

1375
01:34:15,982 --> 01:34:17,709
If it goes well, we can go home.

1376
01:34:18,669 --> 01:34:20,406
John Peter's been amazing.

1377
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:21,549
Oh, yes, he is.

1378
01:34:22,478 --> 01:34:23,605
The day he won my case,

1379
01:34:23,629 --> 01:34:26,518
I wanted to take him to dinner,
so we came to this place.

1380
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,086
The investors
happened to be here.

1381
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:31,439
We drank all night, and the
next day I had the job.

1382
01:34:40,814 --> 01:34:42,358
It's the concert hall.

1383
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:43,533
Mmm.

1384
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:51,469
I like this place.

1385
01:34:53,966 --> 01:34:55,246
And I like you.

1386
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,726
It's gonna be hard to say
goodbye to you again.

1387
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,790
I think we should do it now.

1388
01:35:09,743 --> 01:35:10,862
Goodbye.

1389
01:35:11,566 --> 01:35:12,566
Goodbye.

1390
01:36:02,606 --> 01:36:03,950
Come, sit down.

1391
01:36:08,813 --> 01:36:10,998
Uh, we won.

1392
01:36:11,022 --> 01:36:13,486
Your husband is going away
for a very long time.

1393
01:36:14,798 --> 01:36:16,975
You're safe now, it's over.
You can go home.

1394
01:36:17,709 --> 01:36:18,863
You can go anywhere.

1395
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,471
How am I ever gonna thank you?

1396
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,646
Oh, I intend to bill you

1397
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:36,086
substantially.

1398
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,006
I have a girlfriend now
who eats caviar

1399
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,079
the way the rest of us
eat frosted flakes.

1400
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,606
- Alice?
- Yeah.

1401
01:36:43,855 --> 01:36:45,197
She's a monster.

1402
01:37:30,991 --> 01:37:32,663
Where's Dad's computer?

1403
01:37:32,687 --> 01:37:33,839
They confiscated it.

1404
01:38:07,247 --> 01:38:08,910
I'd like to change schools

1405
01:38:10,286 --> 01:38:11,983
where they don't know me
and Jude.

1406
01:38:12,846 --> 01:38:13,934
We could move.

1407
01:38:14,766 --> 01:38:16,055
To the city.

1408
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:18,286
We could live
close to the library.

1409
01:38:19,663 --> 01:38:21,710
It would have to be a really
small apartment.

1410
01:38:23,373 --> 01:38:24,719
That doesn't matter to me.

1411
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,334
We could sell the car, then.

1412
01:38:31,022 --> 01:38:32,750
We could get you a computer.

1413
01:38:34,733 --> 01:38:37,262
If you wanted, we could get
one of those really big ones.

1414
01:38:38,702 --> 01:38:40,556
With a box under the desk.

1415
01:38:41,807 --> 01:38:44,309
Just a small one is fine,
thanks, Mom.

1416
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:45,775
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1417
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:59,183
We should probably
stay here, though, for Jude.

1418
01:39:02,573 --> 01:39:03,727
It'd be better for him.

1419
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:06,926
Mom?

1420
01:39:07,694 --> 01:39:09,398
Yeah?

1421
01:39:09,422 --> 01:39:11,310
When Dad said
I had to hit Jude...

1422
01:39:12,686 --> 01:39:14,263
Yeah?

1423
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:16,303
Jude said he could see
why I did it.

1424
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:21,167
He'd have done the same thing
if he'd been the older brother.

1425
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:26,670
So he forgave me.

1426
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:32,687
So you should forgive
yourself, too.

1427
01:39:46,927 --> 01:39:48,014
Mom?

1428
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:52,750
We should move.

1429
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:09,677
I can call you back
at six o'clock.

1430
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:11,597
All right, bye.

1431
01:40:12,974 --> 01:40:14,613
Hi, everyone. I'm Alice.

1432
01:40:14,637 --> 01:40:16,533
Forgiveness is this way.
Just follow me.

1433
01:40:16,557 --> 01:40:18,734
Bonnie, will you introduce
everyone?

1434
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:23,567
And I'm Bonnie.
Peter. That's Marcus.

1435
01:40:24,142 --> 01:40:27,566
Carol. Jonathan. Sita. JJ.

1436
01:40:29,037 --> 01:40:30,797
Carrie. Ola.

1437
01:40:34,894 --> 01:40:36,143
Your receipt is in the bag.

1438
01:40:38,767 --> 01:40:40,046
Thank you.

1439
01:40:49,519 --> 01:40:51,279
Thank you very much.

<i>Spasiba.</i> Thank you.

1444
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,543

1445
01:41:21,806 --> 01:41:22,831
Clara.

1446
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,942
I owe you a lot of money

1447
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:44,047
for rent and everything else.

1448
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:46,199
I can pay you now.

1449
01:41:46,223 --> 01:41:47,311
No, you don't have to.

1450
01:41:48,622 --> 01:41:50,063
Things are going very well here.

1451
01:41:51,086 --> 01:41:52,527
We hired a new doorman.

1452
01:41:53,518 --> 01:41:54,668
Jeff.

1453
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:58,351
He's not helping
people park, is he?

1454
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:00,791
Good.

1455
01:42:02,254 --> 01:42:03,407
Are the boys at school?

1456
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:07,150
Not far from here, actually.

1457
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:25,359
It's for you.

1458
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,246
Thanks.

1459
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,870
You're not very good at
getting presents, are you?

1460
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:31,951
Usually, no.

1461
01:42:34,446 --> 01:42:35,694
What is it?

1462
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,262
Swimming trunks.

1463
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:40,814
I thought we could go
to the beach.

1464
01:42:42,478 --> 01:42:43,799
Now?

1465
01:42:43,823 --> 01:42:44,846
At some point.

1466
01:42:47,726 --> 01:42:49,102
Give me ten minutes.

1467
01:43:24,335 --> 01:43:27,031
If you could just
stand out there, you know,

1468
01:43:27,055 --> 01:43:29,463
you'll get the hang of it
in no time.

1469
01:43:29,487 --> 01:43:31,799
Should I help people in
and out of the taxis?

1470
01:43:31,823 --> 01:43:33,719
No, they can do that
for themselves.

1471
01:43:33,743 --> 01:43:35,702
Should I say hello to them?

1472
01:43:35,726 --> 01:43:37,430
No, they can do that
for themselves, too.

1473
01:43:37,454 --> 01:43:38,647
I mean, if they insist,

1474
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:41,110
you speak
with a Russian accent, okay?

1475

<i>Rushklenov.</i>

1476

That sort of thing, yeah.

1477
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:47,823
You want me to play this?

1478
01:43:51,471 --> 01:43:52,687
Could you if you had to?

1479
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:55,670
Sure.
