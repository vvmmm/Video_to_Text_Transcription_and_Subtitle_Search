3
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,409
You were the VIP patient

4
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,406
at Banseokwon.

5
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,131
You have Seokju's heart,

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,296
don't you?

7
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,529
You have a wild imagination.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,700
But do you have evidence

9
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,658
to back that up?

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,084
I went back to square one
and thought it over again.

11
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,381
Who could the VIP patient be

12
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,129
that Gu Jingi would be willing
to kill a boy to get that patient a heart?

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,101
Who could it be
if it wasn't Lim Taemoon or Yoon Miseon?

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,270
You and Gu Jingi have become enemies now.
But five years ago,

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,060
you were his biggest investor.

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,729
Jayden.

17
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,818
It would make sense
if you were the patient.

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,686
My dad got him a heart?

19
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,068
-What nonsense is that?
-I'm not sure about that.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,658
If I got the heart from him
in exchange for investing in his hospital,

21
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,202
would we have become enemies
just like now?

22
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,122
That would mean that we shared a secret

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,879
that should never get out.

24
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,836
Right.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,915
That's why I thought
you would never be the VIP patient.

26
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,933
But that was the trap.

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
What? Is your pulse rising?

28
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,904
Those who have suffered
from heart diseases for a long time

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,070
have a habit
of frequently checking their pulse.

30
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,741
Since they can have
an irregular heartbeat at any time,

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,279
they're always anxious.

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,621
Let's say I got a heart transplant.

33
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,456
Then is there evidence that shows

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,877
I got Geum Seokju's heart?

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,380
Michael told me

36
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,919
when you were in Korea five years ago
to invest in Banseok Foundation,

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,970
you were in a car accident
and received emergency surgery.

38
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,434
On November 21st, 2016.

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,441
The night I performed
a heart transplant on the VIP patient

40
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,402
at Banseokwon.

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,920
I looked into every single patient
who had surgeries that day at Banseokwon.

42
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,877
Butâ¦

43
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,261
I couldn't find any car accident victims.
Then there's only one answer.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,140
The patient was operated on
by me, a ghost doctor.

45
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,311
So there was no record of this patient.

46
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,019
The patient was you, Jayden.

47
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,078
If you want to ask for forgiveness,
this is the only chance you have.

48
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,002
-Forgiveness?
-Yes.

49
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,915
If there's an ounce of remorse

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,795
for the owner of the heart
that's beating inside your chest,

51
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,851
you should ask
Prosecutor Geum's forgiveness.

52
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,682
And reveal the truth in court.

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,689
See?

54
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,191
You're still so arrogant.

55
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,914
I'm about to be your enemy, but you are
giving me a chance to be forgiven?

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,373
Sorry to break it to you,

57
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,120
but I don't want any forgiveness.

58
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,539
If you think I took Geum Seokju's heart,

59
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,463
find the evidence

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,456
and make me stand trial.

61
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,550
Okay.

62
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,005
That's what I'll do then.

63
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,679
If you had a conscience,

64
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,851
you wouldn't have mocked us
by pretending to be clueless

65
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,061
or helping us find my brother's heart
when you knew all alongâ¦

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,478
that we were looking for you.

67
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,776
Unless you have a warrant,

68
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,073
please leave.

69
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,786
I've got nothing more to say to you.

70
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,756
<i>You think Jayden received
an illegally-harvested organ?</i>

71
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,591
EPISODE 15

72
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,466
I haven't found out yet
what happened in detail.

73
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,393
But that's what
Mr. Han and Prosecutor Geum believe.

74
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,643
<i>If that's what really happened,</i>

75
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,851
it's a chance for us

76
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,146
-<i>to turn the table around in one go.</i>
-I see.

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,190
I'M DONE, LET'S MEET NOW

78
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,605
I'll look into this more.

79
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,790
The accusation Han Yihan made.

80
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,115
-Is it true?
-If it's true,

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,628
will you criticize me too?

82
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,633
No. I can understand that.

83
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,718
People do anything to survive.

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,679
And the heart you got happened to belong
to Prosecutor Geum's brother.

85
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,562
You and that prosecutor were both unlucky.

86
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,187
"Unlucky"?

87
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,361
Are you all right?
You took the drugs a while ago.

88
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,737
I'm fine. It was just a health supplement
that only looked like the drugs.

89
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,374
What?

90
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,374
Why would you pull a prank on me?

91
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,461
I wanted to check
if you were going to take it.

92
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,753
Too bad.

93
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,843
If Gu Hyunseong didn't show up,

94
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,179
I wonder if you would have taken
the drugs I gave you.

95
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,324
Those despicable cheaters.

96
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,149
How dare they fool me?

97
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,582
To be honest,
I felt guilty about what I did to you.

98
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,997
But after seeing everything,
I think I made the right decision.

99
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,420
If Jayden didn't steal you from me,

100
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,053
I wouldn't have done this.

101
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,719
Steal me?

102
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,588
You're still talking like that.

103
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,676
Am I an object?
Something people can steal or lose?

104
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,723
Don't fool yourself.

105
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,056
I had never loved you
or considered you romantically

106
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,352
even for a moment.

107
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,694
So Jayden didn't steal me from you

108
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,232
because you never had me, to begin with.

109
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,525
Now that you know everything,
I don't want to see you ever again.

110
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,797
I must figure it out.

111
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,802
Whatâ¦

112
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,175
What I can do now.

113
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,678
You want me to tell you everything I know?

114
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,517
Then you two must help me

115
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,146
and Susie Yoon with our plan.

116
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,073
We'll decide after you tell us everything.

117
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,945
Explain the relationship
between Jayden and Gu Jingi in detail.

118
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,910
Start from when Honours Hand planned
to invest in Banseok five years ago.

119
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,499
To be honest, Honours Hand

120
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,172
was skeptical about investing
in Banseok Foundation.

121
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,672
Forget about privatizing
the health care sector in Korea.

122
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,594
Setting up
a for-profit hospital is difficult.

123
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,928
So investing a hefty sum
of 300 billion won in a medical foundation

124
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,139
was just too risky.

125
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,767
Jayden pushed for it.

126
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,518
He said he would negotiate with Gu Jingi.

127
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,942
-Nice to meet you. I'm Gu Jingi.
-Nice to meet you.

128
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,242
She's from our legal team.
This is Ms. Pyo Eunsil.

129
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,370
Compared to our investment
which is 300 billion won,

130
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,459
your collateral isn't much.

131
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,999
On top of that, you will pay back
half of our investment with the stocks

132
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,206
of the R and D Center you just founded.

133
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,215
We cannot agree to these terms.

134
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,260
The bio-related businesses in Korea
will grow drastically in several years.

135
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,886
And the stocks of the R and D Center
will skyrocket beyond measure.

136
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,726
-And as for the collateral--
-We should

137
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,018
discuss that in private.

138
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,324
<i>I did get the feeling
that Jayden and Gu Jingi</i>

139
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,994
might have worked out a deal
under the table.

140
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,290
They often had private meetings
without me and Ms. Pyo

141
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,829
with just the two of them.

142
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,327
And three days before the accident,

143
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,668
Jayden said he would stay at Banseokwon.

144
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,592
And when I rushed over after hearing
the news about his car accident,

145
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,844
he was lying in the VIP room, unconscious.

146
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,220
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE

147
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,561
You should look
into Jayden's car accident.

148
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,234
To undergo heart transplant surgery,

149
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,062
patients must be prepped for two days.

150
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,527
But if he left Banseokwon before
the surgery and got into an accident,

151
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,654
there must be a reason for it.

152
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,407
Okay. I'll ask the police
to cooperate and look into this.

153
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,620
We should do everything we can.

154
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,583
I'll get going.

155
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,333
What's wrong? Are you all right?

156
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,209
Yes.

157
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,503
Bye.

158
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,757
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

159
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,145
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE

160
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,737
PROSECUTION SERVICE

161
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,656
Look into car accidents that took place
between 5 p.m. on November 20th, 2016,

162
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,241
and 8 a.m. the next day in downtown Seoul.

163
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,661
It involved injuries.
So there must be records.

164
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,416
I'll ask the police to cooperate.

165
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,998
What about Cheon Hyungu? Any progress?

166
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,674
No. This rat is determined
not to get caught.

167
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,551
He's not using his cell phone or cards.

168
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,512
So the police have no idea
where he is now.

169
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,432
We must find him before Gu Jingi's trial.

170
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,972
He took care of
Gu Jingi's dirty laundry by his side.

171
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,136
I'm sure he has evidence with him.

172
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,475
Okay. I'll look into his family
and his acquaintances.

173
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,988
Chief Secretary Cheon Hyungu.

174
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,280
He served in special forces
at the intelligence command.

175
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,121
He was in special forces. No wonder.
He had that intense aura.

176
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,201
He served for about five years.

177
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,077
He was injured on a mission
and was discharged.

178
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,504
He received surgery
at Banseok University Medical Center

179
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,753
and went through physical therapy
for over a year.

180
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,759
-His family?
-Even when he was on active duty,

181
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,718
he rarely communicated with his family.

182
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,755
And he didn't seem
to have any close friends either.

183
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,513
But here's the problem.
The special forces he was in specialized

184
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,636
in counterterrorism operations
and infiltration to the enemy line.

185
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,644
It means everyone in the unit
is a master of hiding.

186
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,097
If he wants, he can go

187
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,687
a year or ten without getting caught.
So it won't be easy.

188
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,401
NOTICE OF CONFIRMATION
FOR A VETERAN IN SPECIAL FORCES

189
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,526
Call Mr. Cheon.

190
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,786
I can't reach him since his disappearance
on the day of your hearing.

191
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,160
That's expected.

192
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,167
I told him not to meet or contact anyone.

193
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,588
Then how can I reach him?

194
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,007
When you go to the head office
of Hanjin Bank,

195
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,085
there's a VIP safe under my name.

196
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,432
You'll find a cell phone there.
Call the number saved on the phone.

197
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,926
He will answer it.

198
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,137
Yes, sir. What should I tell him?

199
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,240
Ms. Pyo?

200
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,322
Yes. I'm here on behalf of Chairman Gu.

201
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,576
INSERT THE PASSCODE

202
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,962
PLACE YOUR HAND ON IT

203
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,248
SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED
YOU MAY ENTER NOW

204
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,381
-Take your time.
-Thanks.

205
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,779
CONTACTS

206
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,703
PHONE

207
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,834
This is Cheon Hyungu.

208
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,592
<i>It's me. Pyo Eunsil,
Head of the Legal Team.</i>

209
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,628
I have a message from the chairman.

210
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,841
Go ahead.

211
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,929
<i>The former ambassador, Lim Taemoon,
suddenly stopped the press conference.</i>

212
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,425
<i>He spoke in English
and asked if he was in the US.</i>

213
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,937
<i>And he yelled at the reporters
to stop taking his pictures.</i>

214
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,021
<i>-His acquaintances shared
-Stop taking photos of me!</i>

215
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,856
<i>that he had been showing
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</i>

216
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,990
Are you all right?

217
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,069
I knew this would happen.
But it still doesn't feel good.

218
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,696
That's understandable.

219
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,084
He's your father.

220
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,577
What about your parents?
What are they like?

221
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,576
Come to think of it,
you never told me about your family.

222
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,338
Tell me. I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

223
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,968
It's not that I kept it from you.

224
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,729
I had nothing to talk about.

225
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,229
Both of them passed away.

226
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,985
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

227
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,661
Don't make that face. I'm really fine.

228
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,906
They passed away when I was very young.
So I can't even remember their faces.

229
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,880
Besides, you are by my side now
just like my family.

230
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,011
Mom, we're really going home. Right?

231
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,592
Of course.

232
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,047
Gosh. I love it.

233
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,256
Can you make rolled omelets at home?
I want to eat your food.

234
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,095
I'll cook everything you want.

235
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,265
-Hello.
-Hello.

236
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,153
-Get in.
-Be careful.

237
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,404
<i>We just left the hospital.</i>

238
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,817
How is he feeling?

239
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,235
<i>He's good.</i>

240
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,283
He can't run, but he has no problem
with his day-to-day activities.

241
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,709
<i>I'll head over after I stop by home first.</i>

242
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,670
Thank you so much

243
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,376
for waiting until his discharge.

244
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,883
I'm glad to hear that. I'll see you soon.

245
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,279
KEEP QUIET

246
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,747
KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE

247
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,372
Thanks for coming.

248
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,535
No problem.

249
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,495
I really wanted to see you

250
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,001
dressedâ¦

251
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,756
in a prison uniform.

252
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,134
The thing is,

253
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,513
if I start talking about that night,

254
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,394
you'll be wearing the same outfit.

255
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,097
I haven't told anyone that you were
the VIP patient who received

256
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,726
Geum Seokju's heart five years ago.

257
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,114
You, Mr. Cheon, and I are
the only three people who know the truth.

258
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
Han Yihan and Geum Seokyeong

259
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,696
already know.

260
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,741
Even so. I bet it's only speculation.

261
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,214
They can't arrest someone
based on speculation without any evidence.

262
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,330
As long as I keep my mouth shut,
there won't be any evidence

263
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,302
or witnesses in the world.

264
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,218
You'll keep your mouth shut for good?

265
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,854
Of course,
you must want something in return.

266
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,429
Take only the R and D Center.

267
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,099
And back off
from Banseok University Medical Center.

268
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,364
Your investment would have multiplied
with just the R and D Center.

269
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,359
Besides, it will be very difficult
for a foreign company

270
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,324
to operate a university medical center
like Banseok as a for-profit business.

271
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,124
You'll face various restrictions.

272
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,282
And the press will push back hard too.

273
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,751
If you reveal what happened that night,

274
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,869
you and Banseok

275
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,882
will suffer a huge blow.

276
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,669
That's why I've been keeping quiet so far.

277
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,505
But now, I'd rather destroy everything
instead of letting you

278
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,514
take everything from me.

279
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,425
You're already the winner of our war.

280
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,426
Soâ¦

281
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,603
don't make me use

282
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,692
the last card I have left.

283
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,115
Mom, I said I could carry that.

284
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,868
-No, give me that. I'll carry it.
-Let's carry it together then.

285
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,791
My goodness.

286
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,081
I'm going to step out for a second.

287
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,037
Get some rest in your room.

288
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,051
I'll make you a delicious dinner
once I come back. Okay?

289
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,130
Okay.

290
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,347
-Mom.
-What is it, my son?

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,860
You should've listened
when we were being nice.

292
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,362
No. Junhwanâ¦

293
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,945
Let him go. You can talk to me instead.

294
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,622
Sorry. No can do.

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,910
The chairman doesn't want any loose ends.

296
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,416
Junhwan!

297
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,461
Junhwan.

298
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,301
Junhwanâ¦

299
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,274
Please spare my son. Please.

300
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,435
Go ahead and use the last card

301
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,362
if you can.

302
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,952
Bluffing doesn't work on me.

303
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,747
When it comes to gambling,
I am more experienced than you are.

304
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,792
Do you think there is anything
I can't do in this situation?

305
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,995
Everyone has a card he can't use

306
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,512
even though it's in his hand.

307
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,724
To you,

308
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,104
those are Banseok

309
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,470
and your family.

310
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,226
What will happen if Gu Hyunseong finds out
that you are a murderer

311
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,231
who opened a 19-year-old boy's chest

312
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,654
and took out his heart?

313
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:20,146
He is already crazy enough
to swing a golf club at my penthouse.

314
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,237
Once he finds out that everything started

315
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:28,247
because his respectable father got a heart
for the person he hates the most,

316
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,997
he won't be able to bear it.

317
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,972
-Not picking up?
-<i>The person you reached is not availableâ¦</i>

318
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,675
No. She was supposed
to be here a while ago.

319
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
Maybe she betrayed us again.

320
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,064
I have a bad feeling.

321
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,323
I must go to her house.

322
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,567
<i>Why?</i>

323
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,778
Why are you doing this?

324
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,571
I got you the best heart. Thanks to me,

325
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,696
you became a healthy man.

326
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,624
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Gosh.

327
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,161
You are unbelievable.

328
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,878
You are despicable to the end.

329
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,758
Do you still think I don't know

330
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,560
what you did to me that night?

331
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,016
Whyâ¦

332
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,140
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

333
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,596
do you suddenly want
to postpone the surgery to tomorrow?

334
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,937
I apologize.
There is someone I need to meet.

335
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,735
Once I get a transplant,
I will need to stay here for a month.

336
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,374
It's a difficult surgery,
so anything can happen.

337
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,330
I must meet this person now.

338
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,200
Wait. Hold on.

339
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,788
Heart transplantation isn't a surgery
you can postpone easily.

340
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,964
The heart might go
to the next person on the waitlist.

341
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,722
If that happens,

342
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,804
it can't be helped.

343
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,676
I apologize.

344
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,103
How about the investment?

345
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,644
Let's talk tomorrow.

346
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,772
It's too dangerous.

347
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,818
Dangerous?

348
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,282
What do you mean?

349
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,110
You took various injections
to prepare for the surgery.

350
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,703
It could be dangerous to go out.

351
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,287
Banseok will take care of you.

352
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,830
No. Today,

353
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,673
I will move on my own.

354
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,797
In that case,
I will prescribe a counteragent.

355
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,213
Please wait here for a second.

356
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,258
No matter how important the meeting is,
safety comes first.

357
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,223
Understood. Thank you.

358
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,515
Don't mention it.

359
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,587
At first, I doubted it.

360
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,680
So that I could get
transplantation that day,

361
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,890
you caused the accident.

362
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,350
A doctor is someone who saves lives,
so I never imagined

363
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,808
such a thing.

364
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,020
So I ran various investigations
after I got discharged.

365
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,612
The boy who received
the heart transplantation on the same day

366
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,395
died the next day.

367
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,155
The doctor who operated on him

368
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,408
got arrested by the prosecution

369
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,157
and had his medical license revoked.

370
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,206
You are saying I induced a heart attack
so that you would get into an accident.

371
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,052
Had you died in the process,

372
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,919
the investment would have been off.

373
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,433
Why would I do such a thing?

374
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,549
That's right. The grounds are weak.

375
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,262
So I invested in Banseok
and watched for years.

376
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,978
But the doctor
who had operated on the boy that day

377
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,350
became a lawyer
who specializes in medical lawsuits

378
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,444
and pointed his knife at you and Banseok.

379
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,150
It piqued my interest,
so I approached him.

380
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,152
There were many secrets I didn't know.

381
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,368
The medical malpractice five years ago.

382
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,868
-Give me 200 joules.
-He just--

383
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,503
Give me 200 joules! Charge.

384
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,405
CONDOLENCES
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR GENERAL

385
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,293
<i>I plead guilty to the charge.</i>

386
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,751
Gu Hyunseong's ghost doctor.

387
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,848
Park Kitae's death.

388
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
And the hidden secrets
of those who took part

389
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,656
in the surgery,
Cho Junghyun and Lee Dohyung.

390
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,001
I learned everything
once I began to help Han Yihan.

391
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,168
The broken puzzle pieces came together.

392
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
That day,

393
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,549
you caused an accident
so that I must get a heart transplant.

394
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,550
Then you took out Geum Seokju's heart
and ended his life.

395
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,929
Through a ghost doctor,
Han Yihan, that heart

396
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,806
entered my chest.

397
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,267
Han Yihan wants to punish you
with legal means,

398
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,150
but I am different.

399
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,409
I will take away the things
that are the dearest to you.

400
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,777
That night,

401
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,541
you did the same to me.

402
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,271
-Do you need more time?
-It's almost done.

403
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,729
Please go on in.

404
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,994
Junhwan!

405
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,371
It's okay. He just lost consciousness.

406
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,544
Look for Cho Junghyun.

407
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
-Prepare to move him to a hospital.
-Okay.

408
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,264
-Is she missing?
-Yes.

409
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,903
Chairman Gu, how did the talk go?

410
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,574
At the trial, I will denyâ¦

411
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,855
all allegations.

412
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,622
Pardon?

413
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,620
I thought Jayden would back off
once I pled guilty,

414
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,787
but I can't negotiate with him.

415
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,253
Now,

416
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,285
Banseok and family are all I have.

417
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,342
I must stop him before he destroys them.

418
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,351
NEW MESSAGES

419
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,893
TYPE YOUR MESSAGE HERE

420
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,858
It won't be easy.

421
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,646
The fact you already pled guilty
will put you at a disadvantage.

422
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,316
It won't be easy.

423
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,364
That's why I need you.

424
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,083
We went through a lot together.

425
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,790
Ms. Pyo, please don't give up

426
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,584
on me and Banseok.

427
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,010
Yes, sir.

428
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,678
Chairman Gu, Mr. Cheon sent this.

429
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,308
I guess my luck

430
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,112
hasn't run out yet.

431
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,254
To find Cho Junghyun,

432
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,338
I checked all the security cameras,
but she disappeared without a trace.

433
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,132
The police think there is a possibility
it isn't a kidnapping case.

434
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,178
They say she could have gone into hiding

435
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,930
due to the emotional stress
of testifying at Gu Jingi's trial.

436
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,393
That can't be the case.

437
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,180
She wouldn't disappear

438
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,188
and leave Junhwan alone.

439
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,900
Thenâ¦

440
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,730
It must be Mr. Cheon.

441
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,440
She is the only witness
who knows what happened that day.

442
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,662
If that's the case, it's dangerous.

443
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,069
Even for someone
who was in the special forces,

444
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,327
it would be hard to avoid the police
while traveling with a hostage.

445
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,751
Maybe Cho Junghyunâ¦

446
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,385
I want to go
to the Philippines or Thailand.

447
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,902
<i>He wants to go
to the Philippines or Thailand.</i>

448
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,647
<i>Four million won for Manila,
five million for Bangkok.</i>

449
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,487
Can I go to Manila tomorrow?

450
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,356
<i>Can he go to Manila tomorrow?</i>

451
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,907
<i>Tomorrow?
Then the money is far from enough.</i>

452
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,292
It's possible, but you need to pay more
if you want to leave tomorrow.

453
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,911
Tell him that I will give him more.

454
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,788
<i>It doesn't matter how much it is.
The sooner the better.</i>

455
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,712
<i>If the money doesn't matter,
I'll make it happen no matter what.</i>

456
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,766
It's me, Head of the Legal Team,
Pyo Eunsil.

457
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,188
How did it go?

458
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,284
I did as Chairman Gu ordered.

459
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,110
I will take care of her today
and leave the country tomorrow night.

460
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,486
No. Don't leave the country.

461
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,044
Take care of Cho Junghyun
and turn yourself into the police.

462
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,539
It's Chairman Gu's order.

463
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,670
Turn myself in?

464
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,289
Chairman Gu admitted
to killing Lee Dohyung

465
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,167
and ordering Nam Hyukchul to murder.

466
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,875
<i>So even if you turn yourself in,</i>

467
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,586
you will only be punished
for dumping a dead body.

468
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,258
<i>Although Chairman Gu pled guilty,</i>

469
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,017
you need to get caught

470
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,641
in order for the police
to close the investigation.

471
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,436
You know that we will be at a disadvantage
if the investigation drags on.

472
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,243
Before you turn yourself in,
hand over the phone to the Security Team.

473
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,949
It will be a hassle
if the police get their hands on it.

474
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,120
I will destroy it myself.

475
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,743
I need a way to contact you
until the very end.

476
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,537
<i>Don't worry.</i>

477
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,712
Chairman Gu will take the fall
for all the crimes.

478
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:45,882
That's the only way he can save Banseok.

479
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,013
Understood.

480
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,140
Thank you. I will keep in touch.

481
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,790
I think she tried to avoid the cameras.

482
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,003
Look.

483
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,458
She isâ¦

484
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,379
from New-Hope Law Office.

485
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,384
She left after 30 minutes.

486
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,796
Then she came back after an hour
and retrieved the camera.

487
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,719
Look at that.

488
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,178
We have a chance.

489
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,810
Prosecutor Geum.

490
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,401
These are the materials on car accidents.

491
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,646
It looks like there have been
a lot of car accidents.

492
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,992
Thank you. I will check them later.

493
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,368
You are going
to Gu Jingi's preliminary hearing, right?

494
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,118
Don't get worked up today.

495
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,370
We don't want you to collapse again.

496
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,038
Okay.

497
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,009
-She will be okay, right?
-I don't know.

498
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,509
The hearing begins now.

499
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,638
The prosecution, give us
a statement of the indictment.

500
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,062
Yes, Your Honor.

501
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,979
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

502
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,479
On February 14th, 2022, the defendant
ordered a death-row inmate, Nam Hyukchul,

503
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,733
to murder a victim, Park Kitae,
at Seoul Northern Detention Center.

504
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,566
On March 23rd, 2022,
he murdered a victim, Lee Dohyung,

505
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,778
by stabbing him in the neck
in the parking lot of Banseokwon.

506
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,287
By criminal law, Article 250, Section One,

507
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,880
Article 31, Section One,
Article 37, and Article 38,

508
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,708
I indict him for abetment and murder.

509
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,335
Counsel, give us your claim.

510
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,633
The defendant denies the charges.

511
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,224
He didn't abet Nam Hyukchul for murder.

512
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,604
As for Lee Dohyung,
we claim it to be an accidental injury.

513
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,022
PROSECUTION

514
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,487
The victim, Lee Dohyung, passed away.
Why do you claim it to be an injury?

515
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,698
The defendant did cause
an injury to the victim's neck,

516
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,491
but it isn't the cause of his death.

517
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,961
The defendant didn't cause
a serious injury that could lead to death.

518
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,666
We claim the victim's death
was caused by an external factor.

519
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,211
Understood.

520
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,804
Prosecution, apply for evidence.

521
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,933
Yes, Your Honor.

522
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,224
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

523
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,137
Counsel, what's your opinion

524
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,647
on the evidence?

525
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,518
We disagree with item five,
the police report,

526
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,941
and item 12, Han Yihan's testimony.

527
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,494
Item ten, police interrogation report,

528
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,029
and item 20,
prosecution interrogation report.

529
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,873
We deny them all.

530
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,534
Prosecution, request for witnesses.

531
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,957
Yes, Your Honor. We request Han Yihan
who gave his testimony for item 12.

532
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,044
Okay. Does the counsel
have evidence as well?

533
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,705
Yes, Your Honor. We submit

534
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,053
the security camera footage
of Banseokwon's parking lot that day.

535
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,840
We also request Banseokwon's employee
from the footage, Cho Darom, as a witness.

536
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,097
They want me as a witness?

537
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,733
Interesting.

538
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,479
Will you be okay?

539
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,234
Of course, I will be okay.

540
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,186
Do you think I will be
as slow-witted as this bear?

541
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,277
Stop digging up my dark past.

542
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,862
He admitted all allegations.

543
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,156
Why did he deny them
on the day of the hearing?

544
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,252
He thinks he can win the trial

545
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,249
because the witness
and accomplice disappeared.

546
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,079
We must find them.

547
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,501
If Mr. Cheon kills Cho Junghyun,

548
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,627
there won't be anyone who witnessed
what happened five years ago.

549
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,434
There is

550
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,761
one more person.

551
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,656
Is it my turn?

552
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,972
Were you preparing to leave the country?

553
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:45,387
Yes. Honours Hand took over
Banseok Foundation's board.

554
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,641
Chairman Gu got arrested for murder,

555
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,774
so my work here is done.

556
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,818
I am sorry. I couldn't have guessed

557
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,949
that Chairman Gu had taken out
a patient's heart.

558
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,569
Is that really the case?

559
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,412
You are an experienced pathologist,

560
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,248
so you must have known
that the heart you examined didn't match

561
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,041
the patient's records.

562
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,875
Your sin

563
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,090
is no smaller
than Lee Dohyung or Cho Junghyun's.

564
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,010
The autopsy report you fabricated

565
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,848
buried the truth
about Gu Jingi stealing the heart.

566
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,693
If you have any conscience left,

567
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,148
stop thinking about running away
and reveal the truth.

568
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,662
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER
TO RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY

569
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,329
Mr. Gu Jingi, you have
a request for a meeting.

570
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,206
Who is it?

571
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,418
He is Mr. Han Yihan.

572
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,172
Would you meet him?

573
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,466
Mr. Gu Jingi refused a meeting.

574
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,311
Did you give him my name?

575
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,475
Yes. He asked me to send you away
because he doesn't want to see you.

576
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,736
Jayden, that crazy punk!

577
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,157
He is trying to swallow Banseok whole!

578
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,457
We must stop him.

579
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,131
There can't be Banseok
without Cardiothoracic Surgery.

580
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,840
It won't be easy to turn it
into a for-profit hospital.

581
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,218
But if the stock price continues to drop,

582
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,549
it will be impossible
to pay back Honours Hand

583
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,550
using your shares and assets.

584
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,058
Then you will have to issue
convertible bonds.

585
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,597
Then you will lose Banseokwon
and Banseok University Medical Center.

586
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,476
That's why we need to think of a way
to stop them!

587
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,194
Until when will we sit still
and let them have their way?

588
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,533
Who is it?
I told people not to come today.

589
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,834
Han Yihan?

590
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,564
What are you scheming?

591
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,373
Don't say anything stupid to my mother.

592
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,620
I'm here to help you, so move.

593
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,762
It's been a while.

594
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,716
You too, Yoonjung?

595
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,392
I don't need you to greet me,
so cut to the chase.

596
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,101
I don't wish to talk to you.

597
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,524
I'm here to save you.

598
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,187
-What?
-From Jayden and Honours Hand.

599
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,403
How?

600
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,033
At this rate, you'll lose all of Banseok.

601
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,281
I'll stop that.

602
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,202
-How will you stop that?
-Hold on.

603
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,530
Let's hear him out.

604
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,245
Okay. Tell me.

605
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,246
How will you save us?

606
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,751
Before I tell you, I have a question.

607
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,128
-What is it?
-How much do you know

608
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,802
about your husband, Gu Jingi?

609
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,967
What do you mean?

610
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,562
What will you do
if your husband, Gu Jingi, killed

611
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,769
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong's brother,

612
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,688
took out his heart, and used it
to do an illegal heart transplant?

613
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,402
What?

614
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,416
Was your trip here okay, Boss?

615
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,547
I'm not your boss yet.

616
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,175
I need to talk to Han Yihan
and hear from him first.

617
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,846
To see if what you said is true.

618
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,652
GU JINGI

619
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,272
I'm sorry!

620
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,859
Oh, dear.

621
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,108
Gu Jingi has fallen.

622
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,822
It's okay.
We're going to throw it out anyway.

623
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,324
Don't worry about it,
and get rid of everything.

624
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,122
I'm going to change it to my preference.

625
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,332
Why would we change it to your preference?

626
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,293
Did you forget that we agreed to hand over
the chairman position every two years?

627
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,745
Then you can redecorate in two years.

628
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,967
I'm going to be using this office,
so I'll do what I want.

629
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,675
Oh, my. Thank you
for taking the time to come here.

630
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:19,974
What are you doing?

631
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:23,425
I'm going to become the chairman
of Banseok Foundation soon.

632
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,017
That's why I'm cleaning it out in advance.

633
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:31,323
Come to think of it, I forgot to tell you.

634
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,940
About what?

635
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,107
As Banseok Foundation is being reborn,

636
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,492
I intend to leave it to a young
and competent management specialist.

637
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,291
I'll reorganize
the board of directors with outsiders.

638
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,831
-What?
-This isn't what we agreed to.

639
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,665
You said we'd be chairmen.

640
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,671
I'm sorry.
I was planning on doing that initially,

641
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,094
but as I watched you, I realized

642
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,760
you're incompetent and greedy.

643
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,885
You're the worst people

644
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,312
to lead an organization.

645
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,982
What? You punk.

646
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,355
That's enough. I won't warn you again.

647
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,780
Don't worry.

648
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,649
I'll fulfill your greed.

649
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,566
I will give you the dividend
I promised every year.

650
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,079
I know money is more important

651
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,290
than running Banseok for you.

652
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,170
We will start the trial.

653
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,957
PROSECUTION

654
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,595
I'm here with some coffee!

655
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:48,104
Soohee, I got you three shots of espresso.
Here you go.

656
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,436
Yihan, I got you a cold brew latte. Here.

657
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,731
-Thank you.
-No problem.

658
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,361
I'm done writing the article.

659
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,235
After the trial,
dozens of articles about Gu Jingi

660
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,742
and Jayden's
illegal organ harvesting suspicions

661
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,945
will be plastered
all over the portal sites in Korea.

662
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,115
I knew it. You're so competent.

663
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,834
You are as good at your job
as you are beautiful.

664
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,536
What is that? Who is it?

665
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,496
LAWYER HAN YIHAN

666
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,054
This is Chief Director Susie Yoon.

667
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,678
Susie, this is Lawyer Han Yihan.

668
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,348
You're Han Yihan?

669
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,055
I heard about you.

670
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,645
You played a decisive role

671
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,821
in bringing down Banseok with Jayden.

672
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,608
Let me introduce myself.

673
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,777
I'm the Chief Director
of Honours Hand headquarters, Susie Yoon.

674
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,244
Nice to meet you. I'm Lawyer Han Yihan.

675
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,328
On March 23rd, 2022, at around 10 a.m.,

676
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,923
the day of the hearing
for the Minister of Health and Welfare,

677
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,750
you met with the victim
who was to testify as a witnessâ¦

678
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,166
<i>at your hearing.</i>

679
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,255
<i>-I didn't think--
-This is nothing.</i>

680
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:04,799
<i>Let go!</i>

681
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,846
<i>Sir!</i>

682
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,350
<i>-Let go!</i>
-Oh, my.

683
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,847
As you can see, the defendant

684
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,357
clearly aimed for the victim's vital point

685
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,900
as he swung a weapon at him.

686
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,323
Furthermore, the location
in which the victim was attacked

687
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,862
was the hospital
that the defendant was in charge of,

688
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,816
but he didn't take any action to save him.

689
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,038
Therefore, it is clear
that he had intentions to kill him.

690
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,827
COUNSEL

691
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,382
Counsel, do you have anything to say?

692
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,589
Yes, Your Honor.

693
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,047
The victim was a colleague of the victim

694
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,595
who has worked together
on numerous surgeries.

695
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,560
So why would he attack that kind of person

696
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,903
on the most important day of his life?

697
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,148
The fountain pen that the defendant
used to stab the victim

698
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,566
had a micro camera hidden within it.

699
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,489
When the defendant found out,
he lost his temper in the moment

700
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,117
and took the pen from him.

701
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:16,884
When the victim tried to take
the pen back from him, he was flustered,

702
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,749
so he accidentally swung his arm
to hold onto it.

703
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,339
Even if stabbing the victim
in the neck was accidental,

704
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,137
the fact that the defendant didn't do
anything to save his life is a fact.

705
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,933
That's true. It is unfortunate.

706
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,060
But at that moment,

707
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,065
the defendant was consumed
with the realization

708
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,648
that his colleague had betrayed him.

709
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,953
He also had a hearing an hour later.

710
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,028
In this situation,

711
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,083
how many people could calmly give orders

712
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,792
for medical assistance?

713
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,796
Could you do that, Prosecutor?

714
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,423
She's deviating
from the essence of the case.

715
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,469
Please rephrase this.

716
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,971
Sustained.

717
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,852
Counsel, please give your argument
based on the facts.

718
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,060
I will practice caution.

719
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,982
Then from this point forward,
I will speak about the truth.

720
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,731
Is the person who murdered the victim

721
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,487
really the defendant sitting here?

722
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,204
The victim didn't die

723
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,458
on the spot in the parking lot.

724
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,174
The person who ended his lifeâ¦

725
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,140
was this man,
Chief Secretary Cheon Hyungu.

726
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,633
Mr. Cheon. Good work.

727
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,594
-Why did you bring these guys?
-You don't need to worry.

728
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,387
I brought them just in case.

729
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,216
Before that, give me your phone first.

730
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,352
Wait.

731
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,354
I'm going to give
Chairman Gu my last report

732
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,232
and destroy it myself.

733
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,773
No. We will take it and destroy it.

734
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,237
Hand it over.

735
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,654
Okay.

736
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,329
Thank you.

737
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,657
Sir!

738
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,865
What are you doing? Get him!

739
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,791
Counsel. Please start your questioning.

740
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:12,799
Witness. On March 23rd, 2022
at around 9 a.m.,

741
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,054
you installed a camera
and an audio recording device in your car

742
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,348
and filmed the footage of the victim
meeting the defendant. Right?

743
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,983
-Yes.
-Did someone order you to film the video?

744
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,440
-Yes.
-Who is it?

745
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,653
Be specific.

746
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,863
PROSECUTION

747
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,612
WITNESS

748
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,204
It was Han Yihan.

749
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,744
"Han Yihan?"

750
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,369
Are you talking about the lawyer Han Yihan
from New-Hope Law Office?

751
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:42,957
Yes.

752
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,750
Was he also the person
who gave you orders to post it

753
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,875
onto a streaming site?

754
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,090
-Yes.
-Then that means

755
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,013
you filmed the victim
meeting with the defendant

756
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,642
with the purpose of posting it
onto a streaming site.

757
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,561
Without the consent
of the person involved.

758
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,192
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung
gave his consent.

759
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,479
It was with the purpose
of public interest.

760
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,022
Please answer with yes or no.

761
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,686
I believe
I don't need to answer like that.

762
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,742
It is what I said.
Take what you want from that.

763
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,413
Your Honor. The victim and Han Yihan

764
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,952
colluded to film the defendant

765
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,538
and they induced him
to say the answer that they wanted.

766
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,955
Please keep this in mind. That is all.

767
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,961
Prosecution,
please start your cross-examination.

768
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,505
Yes, Your Honor.

769
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,263
DEFENDANT

770
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,391
Witness, do you know why
Han Yihan ordered you to film the video?

771
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,675
Yes.

772
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,055
He wanted to reveal the truth

773
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,475
about the illegal organ harvesting

774
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:51,483
that the defendant had done
five years ago at Banseokwon.

775
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,986
Your Honor. This is unrelated to the case.

776
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,570
Please strike this from the record.

777
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,235
No. In the video, the victim

778
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,544
asked the defendant which patient
received the heart transplant,

779
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,909
and after he did, he was murdered.

780
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,417
It's an important question to reveal
the defendant's motive for murder.

781
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,012
I agree. Please continue.

782
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,129
Thank you.

783
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,220
Please continue.

784
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,641
He said it was a critical opportunity
to reveal who received the heart

785
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,352
that was removed from the patient,
Geum Seokju,

786
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,604
after he was killed five years ago.

787
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,772
DEFENDANT

788
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,609
Your Honor.

789
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,737
In order to verify if the defendant's
counsel and witness are telling the truth,

790
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,748
I would like permission
to question the defendant.

791
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,036
Okay. We'll adjourn for 20 minutes,

792
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,798
Counsel, please prepare
the defendant for questioning.

793
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,165
Yes, Your Honor.

794
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,916
All rise.

795
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,434
DEFENDANT

796
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,579
The court is now in session.

797
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,541
In your previous investigation with me,

798
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,667
you admitted to the murder
and abetting in murder. Is that correct?

799
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,176
But why are you taking back
what you said during this trial?

800
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,806
When I was being investigated,
I was in a state of shock.

801
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,271
And I didn't have the help
of a proper lawyer.

802
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,652
I was going to take full responsibility
for Banseok,

803
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,898
but I thought that hiding the truth

804
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,401
wasn't the best thing I could do.

805
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,653
You were also very coercive

806
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,201
as you accused me.

807
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,489
Okay, fine.

808
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:09,251
Then in this court, where you aren't
being coerced, can we believe

809
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,499
everything you say to be true?

810
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,037
-Of course.
-Then let me ask you this.

811
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:18,045
Your counsel claims
that it was Cheon Hyungu, not you,

812
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,011
who killed the victim. Is this true?

813
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,009
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

814
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,679
I don't know anything about that.

815
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,805
I asked Mr. Cheon
to take care of things after I left

816
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,523
and went to the hearing.

817
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,105
I didn't hear nor see what he did

818
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,900
to Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

819
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,525
Then that means the victim could've died

820
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,775
because of your attack
and not Cheon Hyungu. Is that correct?

821
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,156
Your Honor.

822
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,544
This is a leading question that assumes
unfavorable situations for the defendant.

823
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,672
Sustained.

824
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,171
Prosecution.
Please avoid leading questions.

825
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,962
I will practice caution.

826
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:04,427
Then I'll ask a question
that the defendant can definitely answer.

827
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,389
WITNESS

828
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,348
Did you ever abet Nam Hyukchul

829
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,600
to commit murder through Cheon Hyungu?

830
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,268
Please answer. Did you abet in murder?

831
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,358
WITNESS

832
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,735
I did not.

833
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,447
I never abetted anyone
in committing murder.

834
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,082
If Nam Hyukchul received orders
to commit murder,

835
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,161
they were orders given
by Cheon Hyungu on his own.

836
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,878
GU JINGI'S COUNSEL DENIES
MURDER ALLEGATIONS

837
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,677
HIS COUNSEL CLAIMS
IT WAS ACCIDENTAL INJURY

838
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,230
So he wants to take this all the way?

839
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:02,573
So you didn't murder Lee Dohyung,

840
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,780
nor did you abet Nam Hyukchul
to commit murder.

841
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,912
And you never took out

842
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,946
Geum Seokju's heart at Banseokwon
five years ago.

843
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,372
Your Honor. This case is unrelated
to the case from five yearsâ¦

844
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,455
Yes.

845
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,536
I didn't.

846
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,300
It is true that my emotions took over
and I attacked Assistant Director Lee.

847
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,512
But I never intentionally murdered anyone
or abetted anyone to commit murder.

848
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,894
Because taking a patient's life

849
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,178
on purpose at my hospital

850
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,190
is unimaginable.

851
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,735
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

852
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,785
Counsel. What is this?

853
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,122
What is this noise?

854
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,875
Suddenlyâ¦

855
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,468
Counsel.

856
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,595
Is this phone you have in your hand yours?

857
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:27,735
Your Honor. Prosecution has confirmed
circumstances that suggest this cellphone

858
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,949
possessed by the defendant's counsel
is important evidence in this case.

859
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,620
Please consent to check it.

860
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,119
What are you doing? Let go.

861
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,660
Prosecution. What do you mean?
How is it evidence?

862
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,464
COUNSEL

863
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,043
DEFENDANT

864
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,342
Who is it?

865
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,849
<i>It's Cheon Hyungu.</i>

866
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,352
Where are you?

867
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,439
<i>I'm at the courthouse.</i>

868
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,516
Mr. Cheon Hyungu?

869
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,239
Yes, that's right.

870
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,739
What is this?
Prosecution, what is going on?

871
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,399
Cho Junghyun, Cheon Hyungu.

872
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,614
Were you planning on killing them both?

873
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,204
Did you say you were sick of this?

874
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,871
I'm sick of it too,
so I'll reveal everything

875
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,196
right here, right now.

876
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,799
Your Honor, I would like to call
Cheon Hyungu to the stand.

877
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,926
Let me introduce myself.

878
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,102
I'm the Chief Director
of Honours Hand headquarters, Susie Yoon.

879
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,682
<i>I'm going to take Honours Hand
from Jayden.</i>

880
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,268
I'm getting revenge. Revenge for taking
the most precious thing in my life.

881
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,725
Prosecution. Are you okay?

882
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,942
Seokyeong. Call an ambulance. Hurry!

883
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:02,280
I don't think
I can defend you anymore. I'm sorry.

884
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,657
<i>I'm going to leave the country as soon
as I redeem my investment in stocks.</i>

885
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,830
<i>I wanted to be with you guys
for a bit longer.</i>

886
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,794
Thank you.
