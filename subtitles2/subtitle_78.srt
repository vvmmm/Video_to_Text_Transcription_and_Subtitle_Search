00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,532
"December 4, 1921."

5
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:06,845
"Samara District, Soviet Russia."

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,505
"Today I came upon a group of
men in a makeshift cemetery"

7
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,921
"digging a mass grave."

8
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:16,406
"When I asked where the bodies were,"

9
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,787
"one of them explained..."

10
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:21,653
"We are trying now to make a place"

11
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:23,828
"to put the future corpses."

12
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:27,797
"We are afraid we won't have
the strength to do it later."

13
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:33,147
"As I looked at them,
I wondered if any of those men"

14
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:37,393
"thought he might be digging
his own grave."

15
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:41,535
Will Shafroth,
American Relief Administration.

16
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:55,860
In July 1921,
noted Russian author Maxim Gorky

17
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:58,138
issued a plea to the West.

18
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:03,246
"Gloomy days have come
for the country of Tolstoy,"

19
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,664
"Dostoyevsky, Mendeleev," Gorky wrote.

20
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:10,253
"I ask for prompt aid
to the Russian people."

21
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,981
"Give bread and medicine."

22
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:16,363
Gorky never mentioned Vladimir Lenin

23
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:18,538
or his Bolshevik revolution.

24
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:25,165
Russia had suffered a drought,
which was not unusual.

25
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,479
The famine of 1921 was.

26
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:32,275
It would become the worst
natural disaster in Europe

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,175
since the Black Plague in the Middle Ages.

28
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,938
There was this historical coincidence

29
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,837
of a number of social forces:

30
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,942
the collapse of the tsarist regime,

31
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,599
the outbreak of civil war,

32
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:48,188
the policies of the Bolsheviks themselves.

33
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,607
The government carried out
mass requisitioning of grain,

34
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:56,817
which prevented peasants
from feeding themselves

35
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,441
or even having enough seed
to carry on next season

36
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:03,617
planting a new crop.

37
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,934
Herbert Hoover,
the new secretary of commerce

38
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,901
under President Warren Harding,

39
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:15,249
spotted Gorky's plea in a newspaper.

40
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:18,011
Hoover was also the director

41
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,875
of the American Relief Administration,

42
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,843
known as the ARA.

43
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,121
For most Americans,

44
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,504
Herbert Hoover is associated
with the Great Depression.

45
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,299
But back in the 1920s,

46
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,751
his image was one of being
a very efficient...

47
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:36,788
a hardheaded humanitarian

48
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,652
who knew how to get the food through.

49
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:42,656
No one in the West had better credentials

50
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:46,695
to answer Gorky's request
than Herbert Hoover.

51
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,250
Hoover was a Stanford-trained
mining engineer

52
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,390
who had operated in Australia, China,

53
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,910
and Russia's Ural Mountains,

54
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,120
and knew the logistics
of moving men and materiel

55
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,329
around the world.

56
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:04,954
When World War I broke out, he
was asked to organize the relief

57
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,750
of an entire nation.

58
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:11,064
There were seven million Belgians

59
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,274
living under German occupation.

60
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,863
So it became Hoover's responsibility

61
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:19,624
to provide daily food assistance

62
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,350
that would keep all those people alive.

63
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:25,561
And Hoover showed that he had
the administrative talents

64
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:29,841
as well as the humanitarian
sympathies to pull this off.

65
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:34,363
And he became an American hero
and even an international hero.

66
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,993
After the war,

67
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,237
the Paris Peace Conference
asked the United States

68
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,447
to feed tens of millions in 21 countries

69
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:53,934
throughout war-torn Europe
and the Near East.

70
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:58,801
The U.S. created the ARA
with Herbert Hoover as its head.

71
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,841
It has been said, and I think correctly,

72
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,463
that Herbert Hoover was responsible

73
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:10,951
for saving more lives than
any person who has ever lived.

74
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,061
He became known
as the "Master of Emergencies"

75
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:20,098
and the "Great Humanitarian,"

76
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,066
the embodiment of an America

77
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,726
proud of its newfound sense of
itself as an altruistic nation.

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,592
Hoover accepted Russia's plea for help.

79
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:39,255
Will Shafroth, 29, son of
the governor of Colorado,

80
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,396
joined other famine relief
workers from the United States

81
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,227
and headed for Moscow.

82
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,955
Spurred by a sense of adventure
and altruism, "Hoover's boys,"

83
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:50,542
as they came to be known,

84
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,442
had done relief work after World War I

85
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,514
and represented an America
that emerged from the war

86
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:58,102
as a world power.

87
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:04,764
Now their idealism would be tested

88
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,973
by a railroad system in disarray...

89
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,149
a forbidding climate...

90
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,534
a ruthless government suspicious
of their motives...

91
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,780
and the shear scale
of starvation and death.

92
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,577
They would be among
the first Americans to see

93
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:27,269
the earth-shaking revolution

94
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,479
that Vladimir Lenin and
his Bolsheviks had wrought

95
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,619
and the first to feel the tensions

96
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,208
that would mark U.S.-Soviet
relations

97
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:36,968
for much of the century.

98
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,806
On September 1, 1921,

99
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,601
the first ship carrying
American relief supplies

100
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,672
arrived from Hamburg, Germany,

101
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:55,193
and docked at Petrograd,
the former St. Petersburg.

102
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:02,373
It began to unload 700 tons of
rations that had been in storage

103
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,064
since the European relief.

104
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,279
The ARA's goal in Russia was
to do what it had done

105
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,316
in postwar Europe:

106
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,078
feed children, mainly in the cities.

107
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:21,841
Feeding one million seemed
a manageable task.

108
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:27,156
Within a week, the first ARA
feeding station opened

109
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,987
in Petrograd School number 27.

110
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:40,860
The menu was white bread,
corn grits, rice, milk, cocoa,

111
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,310
and sugar.

112
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:48,902
At a time when there
was not a spark of hope anywhere,

113
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:52,526
unexpectedly, without any reason,

114
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:56,323
nobody could explain why Americans came,

115
00:07:56,358 --> 00:08:00,638
why they provide food for children.

116
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:10,682
The "Chicago Tribune" began running a story

117
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:14,169
that would captivate America.

118
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,451
It also appealed for funds.

119
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:28,459
Private donations began to flow to the ARA.

120
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,089
Five days after his arrival in Moscow,

121
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:42,093
Will Shafroth was part of an ARA
scouting party sent east

122
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:45,269
to evaluate the famine in the Volga valley.

123
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,178
People had fled their villages,
desperate to escape the famine.

124
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,427
At the station at Kazan
on the northern Volga,

125
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,877
Shafroth noted "wretched creatures

126
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:11,674
huddled together in compact
masses like a seal colony."

127
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,958
Most were children whose mothers
had deserted them or had died.

128
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,765
Shafroth and his fellow scouts
then drove to a home

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,802
for orphaned and abandoned children

130
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:39,392
whose lice-ridden clothes
had to be destroyed.

131
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,465
"I saw emaciated little skeletons,

132
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,987
"whose gaunt faces and toothpick
legs testified to the truth

133
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,231
of the report that they were
dying daily by the dozen."

134
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,203
"The stench was nauseating."

135
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:03,174
He served with the ARA in Poland
right after the war,

136
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,764
but he had never witnessed
scenes of horror like this.

137
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:13,874
Shafroth witnessed
the same or worse in Simbirsk,

138
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,120
in Sengiley, in Samara.

139
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,748
Once the richest grain-growing
province in the Volga valley,

140
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:29,131
Samara was now at the heart of the famine.

141
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:34,274
My father wrote about one children's home

142
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,762
in Samara where 283 children
were confined to three rooms.

143
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,875
"They were sitting on the floor,

144
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,429
"and when I asked the brave
little lady where they slept,

145
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:54,398
"she pointed to the floor and said, 'There.

146
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,883
"We have no other place
for them.'

147
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,473
"And then she had those
little, hungry, homeless waifs

148
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,889
sing for me."

149
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:20,286
My dad said he had to turn away.

150
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,220
It was more than he could stand.

151
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:33,299
In October
1921, Colonel Walter L. Bell,

152
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,473
a National Guardsman from Syracuse,

153
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,580
was dispatched into the abyss
of the unknown...

154
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,653
Ufa in Bashkiria, 725 miles from Moscow,

155
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:46,208
at the foot of the Ural Mountains.

156
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:49,970
His relief district would expand
east across the Urals

157
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:52,041
to the edge of Siberia.

158
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:58,669
"It is impossible
to describe the suffering and misery

159
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:01,603
that presented itself
on every side."

160
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,610
"I found the only food was made from weeds

161
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:13,856
mixed with ground-up bones,
tree bark, and clay."

162
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:18,482
The famine was awful.

163
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:23,625
People were eating almost everything

164
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,558
that could be swallowed.

165
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:28,975
They ate straw from the roof.

166
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,188
Using this straw and such
substitutes of food,

167
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,086
they became ill and they look

168
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,296
something like fat men,

169
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,162
but it was the beginning of their illness.

170
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:55,035
We had a camel...
two camels our family had.

171
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,247
Finally, of course, we ate him, our family.

172
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:06,495
So we ate all cats, dogs,
horses, everything.

173
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,569
Shafroth and Bell wired their reports

174
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,951
to Colonel William Haskell in Moscow,

175
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:16,091
a retired Army officer who was the director

176
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,887
of the ARA's Russian relief.

177
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,444
Haskell began to grasp the
enormity of the problem.

178
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:28,310
In October 1921,
he wired Hoover in Washington

179
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,899
that the starvation would peak
in the winter

180
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:34,834
and affect 16 million people.

181
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:42,428
Hoover realized the challenge

182
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:45,707
was not hunger, as in postwar Europe.

183
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,021
Soviet Russia faced the greatest
famine in history.

184
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:54,681
Feeding one million children
would only scratch the surface.

185
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:57,236
He needed to feed adults as well.

186
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:03,103
That would mean funding from Congress.

187
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,176
Yet he worried Americans would be reluctant

188
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,937
to spend their tax dollars on people

189
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,181
whose Communist government
many saw as monstrous

190
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,288
and intent on spreading revolution.

191
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:20,604
We had had a Red
scare in our own domestic politics

192
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:25,402
in 1919, 1920, a general strike in Seattle,

193
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:27,058
a bombing of the home

194
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:30,338
of the attorney general of the
United States, never solved.

195
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:34,376
There were many reasons to fear
that left-wing agitation,

196
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:37,897
even of the Communist variety,
was a serious menace.

197
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,454
Hoover had a
reputation not just as a humanitarian

198
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:46,733
but also as a staunch anti-Communist.

199
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:49,874
In postwar Central Europe,

200
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,981
he had helped thwart Lenin's
attempts to expand Communism

201
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:55,086
by threatening to withhold relief supplies

202
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,504
from countries sympathetic
to the Bolsheviks.

203
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:01,714
That worried the American left.

204
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,687
Left-of-center
people... legitimately, I think...

205
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:13,691
suspected that his motivation
here wasn't pure,

206
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,245
because he had this
counterrevolutionary record

207
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,111
with respect to food relief
in Eastern Europe.

208
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:25,013
To them, a Socialist revolution
or a Socialist regime in Russia

209
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,326
was an experiment that should be
encouraged.

210
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:31,260
In Hoover's mind,

211
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,367
there was no conflict
between feeding people...

212
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:36,956
giving sort of straightforward
humanitarian relief

213
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,613
on the one hand...

214
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,824
and using food as a political
weapon to stop Bolshevism.

215
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,791
Bolshevism was wicked.

216
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:45,930
It was evil.

217
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:47,898
Stopping it was humanitarian.

218
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:52,247
Hoover felt the
example of American efficiency

219
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:56,838
and generosity might do more
than just feed the Russians.

220
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:01,463
That was part of his pitch
to President Warren Harding.

221
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,810
He wanted and I think implied

222
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:07,745
that food famine relief could, perhaps,

223
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,057
lead to a regime change

224
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:13,130
and that it might get rid
of the Bolsheviks.

225
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,408
He thought that by bringing in

226
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:19,550
Americans with their talents
and administrative expertise...

227
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:21,172
their efficiency, if you will...

228
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:25,418
that they could serve as
an example to the Russians.

229
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:28,870
Lenin was afraid that he would
try to sneak arms in with food

230
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,561
and try to organize a resistance.

231
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:33,909
No, no, Hoover was not trying
to do that at all.

232
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:38,880
Hoover's primary
argument for helping the Russians

233
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,778
was an economic one.

234
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,610
Feeding Russians would help
American farmers

235
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,060
who were sitting on huge surpluses.

236
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:52,376
Hoover asked Congress for
$20 million to buy surplus corn

237
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,897
for an expanded relief program
for children and for adults.

238
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,073
Some in the House feared it would bolster

239
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:01,799
the Bolshevik government.

240
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:05,872
With unemployment reaching
five million during a recession,

241
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:08,910
some senators favored projects
that would create jobs

242
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,844
for Americans or help veterans in distress.

243
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,265
Hoover supporters and the Farm
Belt lobby carried the day.

244
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,338
On December 22, 1921,
with Harding's backing,

245
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,582
Congress approved the purchase
of surplus corn.

246
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,483
Hoover also insisted
the Soviets buy wheat seed

247
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:35,868
to plant in the spring to secure
the harvest of 1922.

248
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:38,595
The ARA campaign in Russia

249
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:43,358
would be the largest relief
operation to date...

250
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:47,362
and the first to provide relief
to an adversary.

251
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:51,090
The challenge was to get the food

252
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:53,437
almost halfway around the world,

253
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,923
where up to 100,000 Russians
were dying every week.

254
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,592
America's surplus corn and wheat
seed began to move quickly

255
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,802
from the heartland to the holds
of oceangoing freighters.

256
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,055
The first relief ships left
New York in mid-January 1922,

257
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,058
carrying 300,000 tons of grain.

258
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:35,341
The task before the ARA workers
in Russia was Herculean.

259
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,206
During the child feeding,

260
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,554
the ARA had divided Russia
into ten districts.

261
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:46,490
Each had an American supervisor
and a small staff of Americans.

262
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,115
Once again, these relief workers set off

263
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,462
into the far corners of their districts,

264
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:57,639
estimating the new needs,
arranging for more warehouses

265
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,055
to store 20 million bushels of corn

266
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,988
and thousands of tons of seed...

267
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,200
and directing the village committees

268
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:11,066
to identify starving adults
for the expanded relief.

269
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,969
They traveled over the flat
expanses of the Russian steppes

270
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:20,524
for silent days in crude sleighs,

271
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,319
by train if they could find a private car.

272
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:29,464
Their greatest physical threat
was typhus, spread by lice.

273
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,813
They're afraid
to travel with ordinary Russians

274
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:38,887
in third-class cars because of lice.

275
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:40,302
They're traveling along in a sled,

276
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,581
and they get out and they go
into a peasant hut

277
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:47,068
for the night and they see
the walls crawling with lice.

278
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,556
So they go back in the sled,
they bundle up, and they know

279
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,284
"Mr. Louse," as they called him,
couldn't survive in that cold.

280
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:02,877
The ARA had to expand its staff.

281
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,845
With no more than 200 American
supervisors in Russia

282
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,231
at any one time, it hired
120,000 Russians to do the work.

283
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,405
They invited those who could speak

284
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,650
at least a little bit English
or other foreign languages.

285
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:21,067
For ARA, it was practical reasons.

286
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,656
They had an education.

287
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,279
Because most Communists were
without any education,

288
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:30,042
no languages, but the Russian authorities,

289
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,977
they interpreted this
as an opportunity for the ARA

290
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:38,878
to find people who would be able to support

291
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:40,431
counterrevolutions, all these things.

292
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,192
So, different perceptions.

293
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:47,404
Will Shafroth's Samara
district was divided into eight regions,

294
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:50,027
each with at least one warehouse.

295
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,791
Every village had a committee
of local citizens

296
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,896
who decided who got fed.

297
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:05,146
Shafroth would supervise 16,000
Russians in 900 kitchens.

298
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,774
In his sprawling Ufa Urals district,

299
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,397
Walter Bell faced even greater challenges.

300
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:21,403
The population
of that district was almost nine million

301
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:23,992
and the territory is bigger than France.

302
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:26,546
And there were only five or six Americans

303
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,066
supervising the operations.

304
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,482
They didn't know Russian at all.

305
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:34,451
They knew nothing about
Bashkir and Bashkiria.

306
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,487
They kept asking each other,

307
00:21:36,522 --> 00:21:39,042
"Have you ever heard
about those Bashkirs?"

308
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,630
They, they didn't know that
such people exist.

309
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,981
The Bashkirs had been a nomadic people

310
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:51,364
who settled in what would become
Russia's lawless wild east.

311
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,508
In addition to the Muslim Bashkirs

312
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:59,131
who were hostile to the Russians

313
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,822
and had a reputation for plunder,

314
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,894
Bell's district contained Kazakhs,

315
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,345
who for centuries had attacked the Bashkirs

316
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:08,796
and hated the Russians.

317
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,352
"The diplomatic entanglements
involved," Bell would write,

318
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:15,630
"make the Paris Peace Conference seem

319
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,666
like a well-conducted
private school."

320
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,810
Walter Bell faced a formidable task.

321
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:26,089
Unlike Shafroth,
he had no previous experience

322
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:28,056
with relief work.

323
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:36,582
Vladimir Lenin kept
a watchful eye on the ARA.

324
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:43,244
In February, the Cheka...
his secret police...

325
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,696
ordered its agents "to purge the
ARA of undesirable elements."

326
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:53,530
These agents began
to infiltrate ARA offices,

327
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:56,982
hired as Russian assistants.

328
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:59,708
They reported to Alexander Eiduk,

329
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,781
a Cheka agent who was
the Soviet government's liaison

330
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,955
with the ARA.

331
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,304
Was there any
political activity made by the ARA?

332
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,032
Did they meet any suspicious persons here?

333
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,172
Did they agitate against anything?

334
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:18,693
Did you notice any anti-Communist slogans

335
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:21,109
in their declarations?

336
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:27,495
Eiduk also tried
to undermine the ARA's American staff.

337
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,156
One target was David Kinne, the
29-year-old district supervisor

338
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,401
of Saratov Province on the Volga.

339
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:40,853
Cheka agents
had secret instructions from their chiefs

340
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,338
to use every American weakness

341
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,858
to get control over American supply.

342
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:50,449
And David Kinne was
a perfect match for them

343
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,900
because he was an alcoholic.

344
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,148
The Cheka exploited Kinne's weakness.

345
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:03,324
The Soviet notion
is if they can get control of the food,

346
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:08,260
they can funnel it to the people
they want to get the food,

347
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,987
and they can keep the food away from people

348
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,852
they don't want receiving the food.

349
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:18,615
Poretskii, that guy from Cheka

350
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,618
who was supervising American
operations in Saratov,

351
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:23,862
he knew exactly what he was doing.

352
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,591
The Cheka
agents took over Kinne's operation

353
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:33,388
and diverted food from children
to their political allies.

354
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,635
It took several months before
the ARA could reclaim

355
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,431
American control in Saratov province.

356
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:49,232
In March, David Kinne was
dismissed from the ARA

357
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:52,097
and sent out of Russia a broken man.

358
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,733
American relief ships got
as far as the Baltic Sea,

359
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,461
only to become icebound in
February and for much of March.

360
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,432
It was the coldest winter in 15 years.

361
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,954
"The Lord seems to have a particular animus

362
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:25,509
toward the Russian people,"
an ARA staffer mused.

363
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:28,098
"He cuts off the rain in the summer

364
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,825
and freezes up the Baltic
in winter."

365
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:42,630
While touring his district
in the fall of 1921,

366
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,874
47-year-old Walter Bell contracted typhus.

367
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,396
His Russian assistants drove him
for three days

368
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:53,020
back to Ufa, delirious.

369
00:25:55,884 --> 00:26:00,959
He was unconscious for
three weeks and almost died.

370
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,859
Harold Blandy, Bell's assistant in Ufa,

371
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,447
also came down with typhus.

372
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:10,969
Harold Blandy had a big heart.

373
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,763
Harold Blandy was the type who could not

374
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:14,973
simply go into a children's home
and inspect it.

375
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,629
He had to go into a children's home

376
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:21,324
and interact with the children,
put his hand on the kid's head.

377
00:26:24,223 --> 00:26:27,468
It wasn't a surprise to the Ufa Americans

378
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,403
that Blandy caught typhus.

379
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:34,130
Blandy died a week later.

380
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,549
To the Russians,
his death warranted a tribute...

381
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:43,380
an elaborate funeral procession in Moscow.

382
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:50,111
To the ARA, anyone who caught
typhus, much less died from it,

383
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:52,424
was an embarrassment.

384
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,151
To be outwitted by lice was to fall short

385
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:58,499
of being a cautious and
efficient relief worker.

386
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,403
When Walter Bell recovered,

387
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:08,785
he resumed his tour of some
of the remotest parts

388
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:10,166
of his district.

389
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:16,344
He found a home in what he
called "the wilds of Russia."

390
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,766
He would stop at a village
and spend days at a time

391
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:27,390
with the local Bashkirs
and Soviet officials,

392
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:30,186
including Eiduk's Cheka agents.

393
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,745
"He out thinks these people,"
a colleague noted,

394
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:40,127
"and wins them by his courtesy."

395
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,960
The other directors of the ARA regions,

396
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:51,517
they were not polite
with Russian authorities.

397
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:54,313
And I have read some letters.

398
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:58,455
They were full of sarcasm, irony,

399
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,218
and sometimes they used rather rude words.

400
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:06,912
Mr. Bell, he was polite,

401
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,847
and sometimes, when there were his mistake,

402
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:14,644
he accepted that he was not right.

403
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,755
"One big reason for the friendly contact

404
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,103
"that existed between us
and the authorities

405
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,382
"was whenever we had an
important question to decide,

406
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,385
we had a conference
with the ones concerned."

407
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:37,770
Bell was
older than most of the ARA workers.

408
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,877
And it was easier for local population

409
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:43,673
to perceive him as a boss.

410
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:47,401
He's Colonel Bell.

411
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:51,405
He's, as the Russians would say,
"Polkovnik Bell."

412
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,372
And we're dealing with a country here

413
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:56,237
that has just seen a civil war,

414
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:58,481
Whites and Reds going back and forth.

415
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:00,655
Military authority counts for something.

416
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:07,559
With the Baltic
frozen and supplies running low,

417
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:09,906
Polkovnik Bell told his colleagues

418
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,656
he was forced to put
the children's kitchens

419
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,668
on half rations.

420
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:18,121
Yet he continued to feed the children

421
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,987
of both Russians and Bashkirs
with their cooperation,

422
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,644
not interference.

423
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:34,033
On February 6, 1922,

424
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:38,141
the first American ship carrying
corn to feed Russian adults

425
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,869
docked at Novorossiysk on the Black Sea.

426
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:44,734
Six weeks had passed since
Congress had voted.

427
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,222
The next link in the chain
to feed the starving Russians

428
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,432
would be a crucial one, and the weakest.

429
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,301
Years of war had wrecked
80% of Russia's railroads.

430
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,754
An American journalist wrote

431
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:06,687
of locomotives resting in graveyards

432
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,415
"silently like sleeping monsters"...

433
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,901
of "miles of sick box cars on sidings

434
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:16,214
like rows of skeletons."

435
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:24,877
The corn had traveled by ship
almost 5,500 miles in 16 days.

436
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:33,438
The trip from Novorossiysk to
Samara was only 1,300 miles,

437
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,234
yet it would take 21 days.

438
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:41,653
"The dilapidated railroads were
urged to do the impossible,"

439
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:46,278
Will Shafroth wrote,
"and they did it."

440
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,833
Shafroth received a small
first installment of corn

441
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:52,077
in mid-March.

442
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,286
And actually the Bolsheviks paid

443
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:56,978
to railroad workers with American corn

444
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,291
to make the trains run.

445
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,189
And it was a big help

446
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,778
because Russian government
didn't have money

447
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,642
and didn't have food to pay them.

448
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,546
With relief workers
desperately waiting for more supplies,

449
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,515
entire trains began to disappear.

450
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,416
Shafroth wired Moscow that
local officials in Samara

451
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,765
had commandeered 95 corn cars
for railroad employees.

452
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,012
The authorities in Moscow had no
control over their railroads.

453
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:38,330
By mid-March, almost 7,000
freight cars had left the ports.

454
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:42,334
At the end of the month, 60,000
tons of supplies were waiting

455
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,163
for the empty cars to return.

456
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,181
Forty-six trains from Odessa
in Ukraine were stalled

457
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:04,977
in one yard west of the Volga.

458
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,159
Supplies from the Baltic
via Moscow were stalled

459
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,678
at another train yard.

460
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,860
The result was like logjams on rivers.

461
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,763
Trains were hemmed in.

462
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:35,456
For three weeks, nothing could move.

463
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,565
Relief supplies from both
the Black Sea and the Baltic

464
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,498
to much of the Volga valley

465
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:46,294
and all of Walter Bell's
Ufa-Urals district were stalled.

466
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,610
An estimated 25,000 Russians

467
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:54,337
died in these regions each week...

468
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:59,204
75,000 more deaths by the end of March.

469
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:06,591
People had been dying at this
rate all over Russia all winter.

470
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:12,493
Will Shafroth described
a scene he witnessed in Samara.

471
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,842
"I have seen piles of corpses,

472
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:19,914
"half naked and frozen into
the most grotesque positions

473
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:24,574
"with signs of having been
preyed upon by wandering dogs.

474
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,750
"I have seen these bodies

475
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:31,029
and it is a sight that
I can never forget."

476
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:36,586
Shafroth cabled Haskell in Moscow

477
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,451
that the body of a Russian
assistant who recently died

478
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:43,455
from typhus had been dug up and eaten.

479
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,320
Ten butcher shops, he said,

480
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:48,426
had been closed for selling human flesh.

481
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:55,847
Americans read that Shafroth
himself had been eaten.

482
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:02,785
The government
tried to stop people eating corpses.

483
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,513
And they led propaganda against this,

484
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,585
and they tried to put guards
in the cemeteries

485
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,692
in order to prevent people
from eating dead bodies.

486
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:18,628
Grandma told me about it.

487
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:20,527
When the dark was coming,

488
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:26,084
they put a huge lock to save children,

489
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:29,225
because children were the
main target of cannibals.

490
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:33,712
There were cases of killing
children by their own mothers,

491
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:36,991
by their own parents, and eating them.

492
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:41,375
Some mothers did that for mercy.

493
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,068
But some mothers killed them
to feed other children,

494
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,519
especially very small babies.

495
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,905
And now, at the end of March 1922,

496
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:57,046
dozens of trains with relief
supplies were stalled.

497
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,224
It was unclear why the first
trains were detained.

498
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:07,125
What was clear is that only
the Russians could undo

499
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,610
the train jam.

500
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:13,683
Alexander Eiduk, the Russian in charge,

501
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:17,342
told Haskell everything was under control.

502
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,069
For two weeks, he did nothing.

503
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:24,798
Another 50,000 Russians starved to death.

504
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,318
If the American wheat seed were
not planted that spring,

505
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:30,700
there would be no harvest in the fall.

506
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:34,014
The famine would continue another year.

507
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,466
Haskell decided it was time for a showdown.

508
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:41,573
He decides to send a cable

509
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:44,093
in the clear...
not coded, in the clear...

510
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,750
to Herbert Hoover,

511
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:48,200
meaning that the Kremlin
would be able to see

512
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:49,650
the message he was sending.

513
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:53,654
And the message was the Soviets
are not only not helping,

514
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:55,449
they're being obstructionist,

515
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:59,418
and that until he got better cooperation,

516
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,835
all relief supplies from the United States

517
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,906
ought to be held up at port.

518
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,157
The engineer
in Herbert Hoover had foreseen the limits

519
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:16,608
of Russia's railroads.

520
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,853
He had testified before Congress
that $20 million worth of corn

521
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:23,546
would test these limits.

522
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,342
When Haskell's telegram arrived,

523
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:29,034
Hoover was being blamed
by his critics on the left

524
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:33,245
for exaggerating Russia's
transportation problem.

525
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,939
He was attempting "to kill the
Soviet government," they argued,

526
00:36:36,973 --> 00:36:39,666
by limiting relief supplies.

527
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:42,703
Hoover could have silenced these critics

528
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:45,188
by releasing Haskell's telegram.

529
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:47,984
But he felt stirring up
anti-Soviet feelings

530
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,262
would be inappropriate for an agency

531
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:53,196
"engaged in the business
of saving human lives."

532
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:58,823
Lenin's government got the message.

533
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:02,965
It humiliated, then fired, Eiduk.

534
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,588
It brought in Felix Dzerzhinski,

535
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,970
People's Commissar of Transportation,

536
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:10,489
better known as the founder of the Cheka

537
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:15,184
and mastermind of the Red Terror
during the civil war.

538
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:19,153
He was the most feared man
in Soviet Russia.

539
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:22,674
It was very important symbolically.

540
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,953
The dreadful Iron Felix was appointed

541
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:28,024
as a railroad commissar.

542
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,441
And every railroad worker understood.

543
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,167
It's a sign.

544
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:36,343
"We should do something,
otherwise we will be shot."

545
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:38,207
And the trains started to run.

546
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:01,471
The corn was finally on its way.

547
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,268
Its distribution would be planned

548
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:09,341
in hundreds of ARA offices across Russia.

549
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:14,277
Here the Americans still faced
major hurdles.

550
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:18,143
The culture clash was profound.

551
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:21,284
A lot of the people the Americans hired

552
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,839
had never really worked
in an office before.

553
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,392
If they had worked in an office,

554
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:27,187
it wasn't like an American office.

555
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,327
The Americans wanted you
to get to work on time.

556
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:32,088
You start work at 8:00.

557
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,677
What the Americans found was the
Russians would wander in late.

558
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,748
"Well, there was a goat
for sale up the street,

559
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:38,474
and I had to go check that out."

560
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,166
It would drive them nuts.

561
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:48,933
There were even
problems with the elite they hired.

562
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:51,383
"With the best will in the world,

563
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:54,904
it is rather difficult for an
ex-princess to do cross-filing,"

564
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:57,873
wrote a relief worker from Montana.

565
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,740
Especially baffling to the Americans

566
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,225
was the sense of passivity and resignation

567
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,606
on the part of peasants who came for help.

568
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:16,098
Many Russians
saw in that famine a sign of...

569
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:19,446
a sort of God will, a sort of retribution

570
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,104
for their bad behavior
during the revolution.

571
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:24,727
They seized church land.

572
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,556
They killed priests.

573
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:30,008
"So we can only suffer,
because we deserved it."

574
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,186
These Americans
got pretty impatient with this.

575
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,742
Their attitude was, "Look,
it's time to get to work."

576
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,640
This is their Protestant ethic speaking.

577
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:43,159
"Your fate is in your hands.

578
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,714
"Get up off your knees, start to help out,

579
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:48,164
and let's get moving."

580
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:05,837
Despite the
culture clash, romance flourished.

581
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:11,463
The Americans had comfortable
quarters, food, and cars.

582
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:13,880
Their Russian staff was mostly women.

583
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:22,612
Of the 300 American supervisors,
26... nearly ten percent...

584
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,236
came home with Russian brides.

585
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,596
Weather had helped cause the famine.

586
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,358
Now it once again delayed the relief.

587
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:48,811
A spring thaw made it almost
impossible to get the corn

588
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,365
from the rail-heads to the villages.

589
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,173
The return of winter helped.

590
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:17,633
Horses were important...

591
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:21,740
those which had not died or been eaten.

592
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:26,642
Many were too weak to draw heavy
loads over long distances.

593
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,927
Where horsepower was lacking,
some relied on camels.

594
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:38,516
"The camel can live where the horse dies,"

595
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,001
the "Chicago Daily News" noted.

596
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:43,348
"It grubs up herbage from under the snow.

597
00:41:43,383 --> 00:41:46,420
It will exist on anything."

598
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:53,876
An ARA Russian inspector
remembers seeing 2,500 wagons,

599
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,051
drawn mostly by camels,

600
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:59,295
leave Tsaritsyn and head for Leninsk.

601
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,095
"In spite of the immensity
of the steppes," he wrote,

602
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,926
"it was impossible to see the beginning

603
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,307
or the end of this train."

604
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:17,003
"Even the oldest and most
experienced teamsters admitted

605
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,660
they had never seen
such a sight."

606
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,718
"Contrary to the popular imagination,

607
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:45,859
the corn was not heralded with
the ringing of church bells,"

608
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:48,827
an ARA physician wrote.

609
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:55,834
"These people have borne so much

610
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:58,734
that their emotions have
long since exhausted."

611
00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:15,889
He observed the only surviving
member of a family of five

612
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:17,925
clutch her 21-day ration.

613
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:26,762
My father said
that there were a half a million people

614
00:43:26,796 --> 00:43:29,420
in his district who faced starvation

615
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:31,594
when he began to distribute the corn.

616
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:38,084
Every household got a month's
supply... two pounds per day.

617
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,950
That's the job he came
to do, and he was doing it,

618
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:44,228
and he was very pleased.

619
00:43:56,205 --> 00:43:59,243
People used to call that food "America."

620
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:01,866
So, we were handed out
"America."

621
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,146
At home, people cooked soup out
of it, fed their children.

622
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:08,873
This, of course, was great help to us.

623
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:12,773
My father used to say, "See, the
Americans did the right thing,

624
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:15,811
sent us help."

625
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:22,093
Every day in his
Ufa Ural Mountains district,

626
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:26,580
Walter Bell fed 1.6 million
Russians, Bashkirs,

627
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:32,207
Tatars, and Kazakhs in 2,750 kitchens.

628
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:36,107
One was a three-year-old boy.

629
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:41,457
I still remember they gave us corn

630
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:45,772
and sweetened condensed milk.

631
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:52,503
I was little then, but
I still remember the taste

632
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,746
of that American canned condensed milk.

633
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,718
Our father brought it to us.

634
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,311
Thanks to this help I survived,

635
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:11,073
and then studied and
became a famous dancer.

636
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:26,433
Before the corn and wheat seed arrived,

637
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:31,783
up to five million Russians
had starved to death.

638
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:34,890
By August 1922,

639
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:37,720
five months after the corn
reached the villages,

640
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:41,310
the ARA was feeding up to
11 million Soviet citizens

641
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:44,658
every day in 19,000 kitchens.

642
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:59,466
Jesus Christ brought 13 people bread.

643
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:03,401
Herbert Hoover gave millions
of people bread.

644
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:09,166
You cannot find other example of
such behavior in world history.

645
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:14,964
Herbert Hoover had
insisted the Russians buy wheat seed,

646
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:18,313
which the peasants planted
in the spring of 1922.

647
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:22,282
The wheat harvested that fall

648
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:24,871
ensured the famine would not return.

649
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,912
The starvation in the Volga
valley was finally over.

650
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:38,436
"Whether the Russians
or anyone else realizes it,"

651
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:40,473
the ARA's historian wrote,

652
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:44,201
"we have saved a nation."

653
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:56,834
The ARA's relief operation
in Russia began to wind down.

654
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:10,365
Will Shafroth soon wrote of his experience.

655
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:13,230
"The thing which
gives me the most satisfaction

656
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:17,303
"is the gratitude with which
our help was received,

657
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,270
"from the simplest peasant
who would have died

658
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:22,342
"if he had not been fed by America,

659
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:26,760
"from the mother whose children
ate at an ARA kitchen.

660
00:47:26,795 --> 00:47:30,488
These are the people for whom
we brought in the food."

661
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:35,907
Nowhere was that gratitude greater

662
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:38,047
than among Russia's 14 million Muslims,

663
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:42,189
who paid Colonel Walter Bell
a special tribute.

664
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:45,814
This was an extraordinary moment

665
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:50,819
when the local Muslim officials
decide to show Bell...

666
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:56,100
this infidel...
a copy of the Koran.

667
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,033
It was incredible.

668
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:01,830
They had never shown it
to anyone before, to any...

669
00:48:01,864 --> 00:48:04,281
to anyone who is not Muslim.

670
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:09,769
And they had never shown it
even to Russians,

671
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,911
with whom they lived
side by side for many years.

672
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:20,918
Before he left Russia in July 1923,

673
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:24,335
Bell, who served longer than
any other ARA supervisor,

674
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,650
was named honorary mayor of Ufa.

675
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:33,310
He became known as the
"idol of the Bashkirs."

676
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:39,143
"I feel as though I were a part of them.

677
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:42,146
"I have lived with them through
the worst period of suffering

678
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,734
"they have ever endured.

679
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:48,497
"I have traveled into every
corner of their republic,

680
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:49,774
"slept under their roofs,

681
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:52,812
"broken their bread

682
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:56,091
and listened to their tales
of woe and happiness."

683
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:01,545
"They nursed me through typhus."

684
00:49:04,617 --> 00:49:08,862
"I feel as if I am part
of their new existence."

685
00:49:17,146 --> 00:49:20,253
Herbert Hoover
had hoped the ARA's efficiency

686
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:24,740
would inspire the Russians
to overthrow the Bolsheviks.

687
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:27,743
Instead, it may have saved
the Soviet regime.

688
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,160
He himself in the late '20s

689
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:34,336
said to a reporter named Henry Wolfe

690
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:38,547
that he thought "he had set
the Soviets up in business."

691
00:49:38,582 --> 00:49:41,895
Now, that was a kind
of revelatory statement

692
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,414
for him to make,

693
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:49,662
because he had sold the program
of emergency relief to Russia

694
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:54,425
as something that would perhaps
effect regime change.

695
00:49:56,945 --> 00:49:59,775
Hoover was president
when the Great Depression began

696
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,192
a decade after he rescued the Russians.

697
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:05,332
As Americans went hungry,

698
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:08,474
his image as the "Great
Humanitarian" began to fade.

699
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:13,996
The story of his Russian relief
was soon forgotten.

700
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:16,896
Yet the humanitarian spirit he planted

701
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,346
in the American character lived on.

702
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:24,938
Hoover was really,
in some ways, the vanguard

703
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:27,734
of that whole approach that has
become associated

704
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:29,460
with America in the last hundred years,

705
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:32,739
namely that when there
is a humanitarian tragedy

706
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:36,536
in the world, whether from war
or from famine or revolution

707
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:39,746
or a typhoon or an earthquake,

708
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:42,784
that Americans will be there
to organize the relief.

709
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:48,203
The memory of
the American Relief Administration

710
00:50:48,237 --> 00:50:51,344
lives on in Russia by word of mouth

711
00:50:51,378 --> 00:50:54,174
among the families who were saved.

712
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:57,523
My grandma told me many times,

713
00:50:57,557 --> 00:51:02,424
"Dear Anatoly, do not forget American help

714
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,601
at the time of our
national disaster."

715
00:51:06,635 --> 00:51:10,605
Among those people who were
saved were my family,

716
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,954
family of my father, of my grandmother.

717
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,612
My family will never forget.

717
