2
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,749
Cinderella.

3
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,414
I want in, someone.

4
00:00:57,572 --> 00:01:00,670
Hurry, just get that milkman
and jerk off that goat.

5
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,880
Get me some fresh milk.

6
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:04,979
Yesterday, milk was curdled.

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,325
If the Lady of Avon comes,
get me one of everything.

8
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,831
I you get another wash,
you can have the water

9
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:13,700
to wash your hair.

10
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,076
You know there's a water shortage.

11
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,835
And then you'll take in more
laundry from the neighbors.

12
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:20,400
We need the money.

13
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:25,686
Don't make you another
wig of your sister's.

14
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:29,336
Keep working, work keep
your mind off sex.

15
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,751
Oh look.

16
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,446
This baby is daydreaming again.

17
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,649
I wonder what about.

18
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,251
Probably about all kinds of
dirty and degenerate dogs.

19
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:52,817
Dingling and dangling about her.

20
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:55,868
She mopes through her dreary day.

21
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,466
I think it's naughty.

22
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,862
I should say, if you
didn't if you ask me,

23
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:03,857
which I know you're about to do.

24
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,471
Shirking her little duties again.

25
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:07,601
Disgrace all.

26
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,371
Marbella, Marbella.

27
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,630
Give it a little two.

28
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:19,859
Do you know, that a
not so little birdie

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,779
told me that it was none
other than little ass.

30
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,144
Rella over there that told
mama we go out at night.

31
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,395
I never did any such thing.

32
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,131
I wouldn't, believe me.

33
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,245
I did no such thing.

34
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,334
I wouldn't, believe me.

35
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,400
I did no such thing.

36
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,731
I wouldn't, believe me.

37
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,609
Really, Cinderella,
you are such a bore.

38
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,821
You always force us to behave
so unpleasantly to you.

39
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:43,388
I think that even a
tour most unpleasant,

40
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:46,148
we're not at all that
unpleasant, actually.

41
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,503
Are we?

42
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,273
Are we Cinderella?

43
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,317
Well, I...

44
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,405
Talk.

45
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,688
You think like a snail.

46
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,261
Honestly, why don't
you go old and die

47
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,174
before you would answer a
perfectly simple question.

48
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,593
Or was the question, never mind,
whatever she would answer

49
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:05,466
would be a bore.

50
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,040
Drucella, dear.

51
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,654
We mustn't forget about
Cinderella's indiscretion tip.

52
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,342
Mama, it was unforgivably naughty.

53
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,714
She must be punished, mustn't she?

54
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:16,530
Of course.

55
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,581
How else will she ever learn?

56
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,625
Let's see.

57
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,180
She can wash our dresses.

58
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,266
And they must be perfectly
pressed, do you hear?

59
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:31,076
Perfectly pressed.

60
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:44,129
 Cinderella, sweep the
ashes from the fireplace

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,518
 Cinderella, wash and
scrub up the entire place

62
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,161
 Cinderella, polish
every little widget

63
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:54,744
 Sit up straight girl, don't
you fuss and don't you fidget

64
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:58,037
 And I wonder if I
have to face this scorn

65
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:02,382
 Yes, I wonder just
why I was ever born

66
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:12,017
 Times when I want to
cry, I spy a rainbow

67
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:17,537
 When life is gray, the
flowers start to bloom

68
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:23,372
 Or when a chilling wind
begins the rain flow

69
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,282
 I take a moment to remind me

70
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,945
 Someone will come
along and find me

71
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:34,290
 Suddenly I can
smile away the gloom

72
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,557
 Cinderella, braid my
hair and just for kickers

73
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,970
 Cinderella, darn my
hose and iron my knickers

74
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:49,602
 Cinderella, you're a
good-for-nothing wretch, girl

75
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,587
 Where's my girdle

76
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,256
 Goodness sake's, go
run and fetch girl

77
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:56,333
 And I wonder, is
this all I'll ever be

78
00:04:56,334 --> 00:05:00,679
 Yes, I wonder, is there
nothing more to see

79
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:10,555
 When I am cold, the
morning sun will warm me

80
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:16,100
 When I am sad, the
birds begin my song

81
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:21,691
 And when, at times, my
life begins to scorn me

82
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:25,868
 I take a moment to remind me

83
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,216
 Someday he'll come
along and find me

84
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:32,562
 And the time goes
by and I am strong

85
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,978
 Sometimes I think in a
wink of an eye it'll happen

86
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:44,981
 Life rearranges and
changes tomorrow's tune

87
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:50,622
 But just when I'm caught Ina
thought, I remember tomorrow

88
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:56,287
 And just like today, it
will be on its way too soon

89
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:02,243
 So I can't be down too
long or stay too lonely

90
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:07,907
 For nothing can be
as awful as it seems

91
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:14,674
 When things go wrong,
I know that I have only

92
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,821
 To take a moment to remind me

93
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:20,629
 Someone will come
along and find me

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,975
 And we'll be forever
inside my dreams

95
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,839
Just a
second, we're going.

96
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,347
Faster
Cinderella, faster.

97
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:10,389
No,
slower, Cinderella.

98
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,430
Faster.

99
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,519
Slower.

100
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,388
Faster.

101
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,257
Slow.

102
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,656
Oh boy, oh boy.

103
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,641
Chamberlain, Chamberlain.

104
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,215
Come here at once.

105
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:46,568
Yes, my liege.

106
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:51,895
It's a whopper.

107
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,540
I will summon the
Queen immediately.

108
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,574
No, you fool.

109
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,317
Fetch me my baggy pants.

110
00:07:57,318 --> 00:08:01,603
I'm taking this one into town.

111
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:04,870
Too late, my Lord.

112
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,103
Good morning, your Majesty.

113
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,146
Good morning.

114
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,162
Chamberlain, leave us.

115
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,290
We have private
business to discuss.

116
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,202
Clod.

117
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,169
What is it you want, your Highness.

118
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,515
Your Highness indeed, you
horny little jack off.

119
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:38,642
But what do you want, my Queen?

120
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,951
Next month, our son will
reach his 21st birthday.

121
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:46,607
Well this calls for a double
celebration, I would say.

122
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,035
A double celebration?

123
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:50,481
21 years ago was the
last time you had

124
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:51,699
a royal boner.

125
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,250
Really?

126
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,235
If you had been in here
a few minutes ago,

127
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:01,581
you wouldn't be so quick
to judge me.

128
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,914
But I'm not talking
about pierced hard on.

129
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,541
Oh, oh, don't hurt
me, don't hurt me.

130
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,375
Consider this pleasure.

131
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:12,184
Let's get down to business.

132
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,944
Now I don't mind preparing the ball

133
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:18,986
but one thing I will not
do, and I don't know

134
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:22,642
how capable you are,
and that is tell him

135
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:24,361
the facts of life.

136
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:28,097
The boy knows absolutely
nothing about sex.

137
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:55,882
 There was a time when
my scepter would climb

138
00:09:55,883 --> 00:10:00,142
 Whene's a sweet lass came my way

139
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:04,088
 If the damsel was built,
the tilt of my kilt

140
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,712
 Was a bold invitation to play

141
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:12,900
 But now the thrill's
faded, his Highness is jaded

142
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:17,017
 I'm rather a sad, royal bloke

143
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:21,302
 Girls plead for the
chance to fondle my lance

144
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:25,587
 And I just fall
asleep in mid-stroke

145
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:30,017
 With many of them,
I have tried S and M

146
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:34,617
 But I get no kick from the pain

147
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:38,127
 And though you may think
I'm not one for a kink

148
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:42,411
 I once made it with a Great Dane

149
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:46,576
 I can't raise a bulge in my tunic

150
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:50,667
 Per chance I'm becoming a eunuch

151
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:54,856
 Or am I headed
straight for the day

152
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:58,971
 When I'm blissfully
happy and gay?

153
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:02,771
 I've known more delights
than King Arthur has Knights

154
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:07,444
 My sex life is legend to some

155
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:11,512
 But I've lost my touch
and I dread it very much

156
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:15,857
 The day when my
Kingdom won't come

157
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,171
 Kingdom won't come

158
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,633
 My Kingdom won't come

159
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,718
 Can't get my Kingdom to come

160
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,031
I don't care if the
Prince can't come.

161
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,791
My pee-pee's getting very hard.

162
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,282
Hi Majesty the kind
and Her Highness the Queen

163
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,843
proclaim a great ball.

164
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:51,330
In honor of the
birthday of the Prince

165
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,443
who will choose a bride.

166
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,751
A bride.

167
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,754
From all the
fair maidens of the land.

168
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:00,055
We gotta get ready for the ball.

169
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:02,401
Forget it, you're pregnant.

170
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,101
Is your father about?

171
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,379
My business is with him.

172
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,582
He's out setting
beaver traps, my Lord.

173
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,447
Beaver traps?

174
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,867
There's no beaver in this
part of the country.

175
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,170
What do you call
this then, my Lord?

176
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,171
The fern.

177
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,202
A bush?

178
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:27,268
A bush?

179
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,551
A beaver, my Lord.

180
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,028
Beaver?

181
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,679
Fern, bush, beaver?

182
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,245
Bush, beaver, fern.

183
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,512
Then put your beaver
next to her bush.

184
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:44,816
Yes, my Lord.

185
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,810
Now that's a fern.

186
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,230
Ere here, ere here, my Lord.

187
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,973
What are you doing?

188
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,442
With me two lovely birds.

189
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:01,451
Birds, birds, birds.

190
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,436
It was a hot and long
journey, I thirst,

191
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,221
I stop for a pot of water.

192
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,454
For you, sir.

193
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,109
Invitations from his royal
Highness the Prince,

194
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,167
inviting your daughters
to the great ball

195
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:25,055
in honor of his birthday.

196
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,727
The Prince is born.

197
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,447
The Prince is born,
my little birds.

198
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:36,584
Oh, we broke the balls, eh, now.

199
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,048
You're so gorgeous,

200
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,787
you drive me insane.

201
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:50,371
And you, my lovely, I could
eat you up, you're so scrummy.

202
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,596
I must come closer.

203
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,879
Closer, yes.

204
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,227
Closer.

205
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,849
Closer.

206
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,893
Closer.

207
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,636
Closer.

208
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,933
Closer.

209
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,023
Ooh.

210
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,354
Yes.

211
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:10,986
It's true.

212
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,366
Could I do it to you.

213
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:19,459
 Sweet, sexy and seductive are we

214
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,413
 Hot honeys of the highest degree

215
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,099
 Live, luscious
ladies lying in wait

216
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,445
 We're so fine that it
must have been fate!

217
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:33,719
 Do it, do it, do it to me

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,882
 Do it, do it, do it now

219
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:40,738
 Do it, do it, do it to me

220
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:44,389
 Do it, do it, do it now

221
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:54,248
 Where could you find
two sensuous sisters

222
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:57,758
 It's evident no
man could resist us

223
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,663
 Right from the very
moment he kissed us

224
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:05,675
 That the fool is
a prisoner of love

225
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:09,185
 Do it, do it, do it to me

226
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:12,429
 Do it, do it, do it now

227
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,648
 Do it, do it, do it to me

228
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:19,298
 Do it, do it, do it now

229
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:29,642
 When we're done with him,
that man's not the same

230
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:33,031
 But each one of them
is glad that he came

231
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,500
 Yeah, even though
we talk a good game

232
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:39,846
 It's been years
since we had us a man

233
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,022
 Do it, do it, do it to me

234
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:47,750
 Do it, do it, do it now

235
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:50,970
 Do it, do it, do it to me

236
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:54,553
 Do it, do it, do it now

237
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:57,555
 Do it, do it, do it to me

238
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:01,138
 Do it, do it, do it now

239
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,213
 Do it, do it, do it to me

240
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,863
 Do it, do it, do it now

241
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,209
The Lord Chamberlain.

242
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,253
My Lord.

243
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,327
Fetch your father.

244
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,433
My business is with him.

245
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,128
He's out chopping wood.

246
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,282
For the hearth, my Lord.

247
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,517
Hearth.

248
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,082
Hearth, my Lord.

249
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,362
Very well.

250
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,805
Some wine, my Lord?

251
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:12,849
Yes.

252
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,653
And fetch me an apple.

253
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,883
Anything wrong, my Lord?

254
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:26,926
No.

255
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,273
Have you binding?

256
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,718
Isn't he paying
taxes, is that it?

257
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:01,107
Oh please, please
don't harm my father.

258
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,303
He's a good man.

259
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,716
And our mother died,
he's all we've got.

260
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:10,694
At least kill us when
our father is done.

261
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:25,020
Please, oh please,
please my Lord, I'll,

262
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:29,458
I'll do anything, spare my father.

263
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,361
We'll do anything.

264
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,534
For our father.

265
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:38,898
I shan't wait for
your father any longer.

266
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,679
When he returns, give him these.

267
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,676
What are they?

268
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,719
Read them.

269
00:25:56,692 --> 00:26:00,444
His royal Highness the
Prince has the honor to invite

270
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:03,615
your daughter to the
great ball he is giving

271
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,615
on the 13th day before.

272
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:11,121
Why that pompous.

273
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:12,164
Poop.

274
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,603
Whoa, Glump, whoa.

275
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:27,147
Hey, Glump, you're the
best trained horse

276
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:28,451
in the Kingdom.

277
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,791
Oh, Lord Chamberlain.

278
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,456
What a pleasant surprise.

279
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,455
I think not, Madame.

280
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:58,800
Oh, do, do, do come in.

281
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,329
Do, do come in.

282
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:20,382
My God, three flew
over the cuckoos nest.

283
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:38,749
With your kind permission,
Madame, may I present

284
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,878
these invitations
to your daughters.

285
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,557
And pretty girl, what
might your name be?

286
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:09,643
My name is Cinderella.

287
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,882
She deaf.

288
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:19,129
We cannot wait, my Lord, we
cannot thank you enough.

289
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,475
This would be the biggest
ball of them all.

290
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:26,591
You have no idea.

291
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:31,578
Do, do, do.

292
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:40,410
Tell us.

293
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:50,592
 His Majesty, the king

294
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:54,112
 Is going to do his thing

295
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:57,840
 He's going to have a royal ball

296
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,753
 His Highness sincerely begs us to

297
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:01,521
 Invite the social register

298
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:05,866
 Only if they'll
come one, come all

299
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,696
 Her Majesty, the Queen

300
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:14,375
 Will really dig this scene

301
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:18,127
 She's anxious for a royal ball

302
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,113
 It's been so many months, you see

303
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,711
 It happened only once, you see

304
00:29:21,712 --> 00:29:26,056
 She wants it to
be large, not small

305
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,312
 The Kingdom will be festive

306
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:31,612
 With wine flowing everywhere

307
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:34,760
 And feasting all around

308
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,132
 There'll be many a buxom maiden

309
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,342
 And many a handsome lad

310
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,780
 And frolicking will abound

311
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,599
 His Majesty, the Prince

312
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,109
 This part of it makes me wince

313
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,886
 Will announce in
front of one and all

314
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,944
 He's looking for
someone great to be

315
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,663
 His future mate, you see

316
00:29:56,664 --> 00:30:01,009
 In simpler words, the royal ball

317
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,231
I'm gonna wear
my gigantic steeple hat

318
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,635
with the big wings.

319
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:20,750
And I'm gonna wear my ruby
breast flattering.

320
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,705
I'm gonna wear my blue and gold.

321
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,152
Glump.

322
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,977
What should I wear?

323
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:53,264
Yes, Cinderella does
need something to wear

324
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,911
to the ball.

325
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:58,647
But first, of course,
she must be washed.

326
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,094
Glump.

327
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,131
Oh look.

328
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:23,794
Here's some soap.

329
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,909
That's
not soap, that's.

330
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:27,980
Yes.

331
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:39,178
Lovely fragrant bath powder.

332
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:46,834
Berry juice for her lips.

333
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:52,575
Ooh, coming along nicely.

334
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:57,250
Now jewels for tiara.

335
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:05,096
Oh shit.

336
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,460
Cinderella, it's gorgeous.

337
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,696
Stunning.

338
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:27,075
It's you.

339
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,466
It's really you.

340
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:36,323
Cinderella, will you stop
wasting your sisters' time.

341
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:38,526
They must get ready for the ball.

342
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,044
You should be helping them,
not distracting them.

343
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:42,522
Ungrateful child.

344
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,429
Glump.

345
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,427
Bitch leg, I promise you
I won't sing anymore.

346
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:58,665
Give me that.

347
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,543
It's getting cold in here.

348
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,644
We should have
been Charlie's Angels.

349
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,582
Cinderella,
we're off to the ball.

350
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:40,927
But please do wait for us.

351
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,000
Thief, he robbed
the old.

352
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:56,795
Thief, thief, thief.

353
00:36:56,796 --> 00:37:00,135
He robbed my sister, thief, thief.

354
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,130
Thief, over there, over there.

355
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:05,510
Stop, get him.

356
00:37:05,511 --> 00:37:07,011
Thief.

357
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,795
Thief, thief, thief.

358
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:11,683
He robbed my grandmother.

359
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:12,727
Thief.

360
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,186
Police, police, thief.

361
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:24,345
Who are you?

362
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:25,389
Who am I?

363
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:28,996
Who are you?

364
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:33,327
Well, I'm Cinderella.

365
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:37,673
Oh, if you're Cinderella,
I'm your fairy Godmother.

366
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:42,114
You're my fairy Godmother?

367
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:43,906
Sure am.

368
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,109
But where's your wings?

369
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,153
Wings?

370
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:52,380
Oh, my wings were clipped
a long time ago.

371
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:53,423
Oh.

372
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,407
But isn't a fairy Godmother
supposed to be a woman?

373
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:01,507
Child that didn't even
know what fairy means.

374
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:04,435
Well a fairy can go
both ways, mama.

375
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:08,085
Oh, well I'm glad to
see you, of course,

376
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,556
but you're not at all like
they described you to me.

377
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,347
When I was little, I mean.

378
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:19,258
I was told that my fairy
Godmother was, well,

379
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,319
fair skinned.

380
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,677
Well, you know my
sweet, of fairies,

381
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,517
we follow the seasons.

382
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:31,931
I just came from a long
vacation in an island

383
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:33,408
and in the sun all day long.

384
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,829
That's why I'm a little
on the dark side.

385
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,985
You know what I mean?

386
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:40,158
But let's talk about you.

387
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,902
How's my little Godchild doing?

388
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:46,770
Not very well, fairy Godmother.

389
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,641
You've been crying.

390
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:55,377
What's the matter, huh?

391
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,750
My stepmother and
stepsisters have been very

392
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,082
mean to me lately.

393
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,091
Tonight's the great ball
at the palace and...

394
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:03,874
I know.

395
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,150
The Lord Chamberlain
invited me himself,

396
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:09,007
but my stepmother threw it
in the fire and it burned.

397
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:13,967
That's stepmother of
yours, she's a real mother.

398
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,540
No, she's my stepmother.

399
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,418
You see, my father
remarried before he died...

400
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:20,358
No no no no no no, cool it mama.

401
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,955
Lay your story on me.

402
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:25,660
Why won't they let you
go to the ball, huh?

403
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:27,936
I am too dirty and ugly.

404
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:31,688
Well, why, I meant you do
have a little crud on you.

405
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:32,732
Yes sir.

406
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,585
But I know, that's enough bad.

407
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:36,629
Well, here.

408
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:39,967
Oh, thank you.

409
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:42,921
Besides, I couldn't go
in these rags, anyway.

410
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,472
Never mind the rags, mama.

411
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:50,935
And about that ugly
face, you got something

412
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:53,283
nobody at the ball has got.

413
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:56,599
You got tits and ass.

414
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,262
Yeah, you can go to the ball naked,

415
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,499
and make them all look like frogs.

416
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,266
Anyway, loosen up now.

417
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,913
We got to do something about that.

418
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:09,382
Yeah, mama, and you're
still going to the ball.

419
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:11,004
I'll handle that.

420
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,255
Do you have a little
something to drink, huh,

421
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,041
do you?

422
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,711
We have
some goat's milk.

423
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:21,486
Goat's milk.

424
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,600
Are you a fool?

425
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:23,469
It means that mother
got a little something

426
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:24,338
in the medicine cabinet, huh.

427
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,547
Which is?

428
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,590
I never heard of that...

429
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,671
How about some smoke, dear?

430
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:31,527
The yard's full in back.

431
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:34,395
No, honey, I mean, Flugel weed.

432
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:37,531
You sure do talk funny.

433
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:38,935
What weed?

434
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,412
Are you going on up?

435
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:45,568
Take a bath and leave the
rest to your fairy Godmother.

436
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,715
 I have looted half the Kingdom

437
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:03,060
 And I've stolen everything
from art to zebras

438
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:05,510
 They were very little zebras

439
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:06,945
 Proving I'm not prejudiced

440
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:10,819
 I've ripped off
Saggitarians and Libras

441
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,804
 The Libras owned the zebras

442
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:16,460
 If you can't keep
up with the prices

443
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:19,994
 I'll tell you what
this fairy's advice is

444
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:22,294
 You got to grab it

445
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:23,674
 And fence it while you can

446
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:26,023
 It's a livin'

447
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:27,523
 So stick it to the man

448
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:29,581
 Gotta grab it

449
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:31,130
 If bread is what you lack

450
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,599
 It's called a livin'

451
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,747
 So slip it in your pack

452
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:40,136
 Won't my family be surprised

453
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:43,986
 When I make my debut

454
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:48,150
 They just won't
believe their eyes

455
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:51,781
 And I'm sure they'll say too

456
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:53,856
 Shove it in your Gucci sack

457
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:57,246
 And load it on the
back of both your zebras

458
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,473
 I couldn't fence the zebras

459
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:01,386
 My stash of ladies underwear

460
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:05,235
 Has even got a pair
of double D bras

461
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,317
 I put them on the zebras

462
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:10,924
 At every other
trade, I'm inept, so

463
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:14,798
 I guess I'll spend
my days as a klepto

464
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,904
 I'm gonna grab it

465
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,949
 And fence it while I
can, because it's a living

466
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:21,845
 You got to stick it to the man

467
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:24,338
 So better grab it

468
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:25,742
 If bread is what you lack

469
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,775
 It's called a livin'

470
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:30,947
 So I slip it in my pack

471
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,820
 With a fairy for a friend

472
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:38,598
 I've no worries since he'll

473
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,821
 See that there's a happy end

474
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:46,550
 And I know the Prince will

475
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:49,914
 Grab it and put it in your sack

476
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,536
 Livin'

477
00:42:51,537 --> 00:42:53,449
 Uh-huh

478
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,838
 Grab it and put it in your sack

479
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,969
 Livin'

480
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,026
 Uh-huh

481
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:04,319
 Grab it and put it in your sack

482
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,498
 Livin'

483
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:08,725
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

484
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:11,269
 Grab it and put it in the sack

485
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,835
 Livin'

486
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:16,812
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh

487
00:43:16,813 --> 00:43:20,185
 Grab it Oh my, look.

488
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:29,089
Remember I said tits and ass.

489
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,871
You got a face to with it, yeah.

490
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,304
But now, what?

491
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:38,164
Now what?

492
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:42,543
Ah, I'll tell you what.

493
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,383
What good will a fairy
Godmother be if he

494
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:46,634
couldn't help his Godchild.

495
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:50,387
Let him go on and see
what's in his bag.

496
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:53,429
We're gonna do something about you.

497
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,538
Yeah, I'll save this for later.

498
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:20,987
I don't know what the hell it is,

499
00:44:20,988 --> 00:44:23,408
I'll save it for my
next garage sale.

500
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:26,102
Those people will buy anything.

501
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,278
Oh is that your magic wand?

502
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:35,322
My what?

503
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:39,208
Oh, oh, of course.

504
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,710
That's what it is.

505
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:43,138
Let's see now.

506
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,293
Which wand is this?

507
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:48,319
I have several, you know.

508
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,249
Could you, could you read this?

509
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,106
My eyes are a little
bad in the dark.

510
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:58,996
This wand can perform
miracles for good causes only.

511
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:03,168
Caution, all miracles null
and void at midnight.

512
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:06,912
Keep out of reach of children.

513
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,212
Does it really work?

514
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:11,561
That's what it says.

515
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:13,376
Could we try it on my hair?

516
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,549
It's all wet and stringy.

517
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:21,268
I'll give it a shot.

518
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:27,200
Stand back, mama.

519
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:29,286
This is some heavy shit.

520
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,463
Chili, sweet potato pie.

521
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:46,808
Change that
girly bitch in my eye.

522
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:06,866
Damn, it works.

523
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:10,430
This thing ain't going
in no garage sale.

524
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:23,740
Fairy Godmother, you've done it.

525
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,396
Sure, I did.

526
00:46:27,397 --> 00:46:28,728
Come here, baby.

527
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:31,161
Come on to your sweet daddy.

528
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:36,377
Wait, oh no, I can't
get into the palace

529
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,289
without my invitation.

530
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:42,436
You ain't gonna
give up that easy.

531
00:46:51,316 --> 00:46:53,904
Pasta.

532
00:46:53,906 --> 00:46:54,948
Lasagna.

533
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:01,821
Bring the invitation out the fire.

534
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,662
Fairy Godmother,
you've done it again.

535
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:19,169
Hey mama, don't you
have any pumpkins?

536
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,295
No, we've got some watermelons.

537
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,248
Watermelons?

538
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:27,823
Yeah.

539
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:30,339
Sure, I hate to waste one.

540
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:33,463
All we gotta do is
find some horses.

541
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:35,085
Any rests around here?

542
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,635
No.

543
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:39,975
I haven't seen any all year.

544
00:47:39,976 --> 00:47:41,887
But we've got lots of snails.

545
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:44,019
Snails?

546
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,850
Yeah, but that sure gonna
be a drag.

547
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:47,894
Get it?

548
00:47:51,984 --> 00:47:56,329
Okay, little snails, soon
you'll be eating oats and hay.

549
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:01,328
Step back, mama.

550
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:02,372
Go on.

551
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:10,746
Ride them high.

552
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:11,964
Ride them low.

553
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:16,894
However you ride them,
ride them with so.

554
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,951
It's beautiful.

555
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:31,420
Oh, fairy Godmother,
it's beautiful.

556
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,301
White sails, black horses.

557
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,432
Ride on wild.

558
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,611
All we need now is a coachman.

559
00:48:38,612 --> 00:48:40,838
You're looking at him, honey.

560
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:43,767
Oh, fairy Godmother,
you're wonderful.

561
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,454
I guess we're all ready.

562
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:48,294
Now quite, child.

563
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:51,126
Step inside this coach here.

564
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,938
Pull up that dress
of yours child.

565
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,101
What for?

566
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:03,231
Did I ever tell you?

567
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,882
Pull up that dress.

568
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:15,769
And split those legs.

569
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:28,368
The better be tight.

570
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:45,064
What was that for?

571
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,769
They have tits and ass, and
a pretty face.

572
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:53,114
But then I gave you as
napping pussy.

573
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:56,589
What for?

574
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,842
You'll find out soon enough.

575
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,051
And when you do.

576
00:50:00,052 --> 00:50:04,396
You'll thank me for it.

577
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:15,448
I could use a bottle of
Dom Perignon champagne.

578
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,450
What?

579
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:19,668
Do your stuff.

580
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,732
Shit.

581
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:42,513
Does wine only work for honkies?

582
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:46,667
Goddamn, get on up there.

583
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:57,277
Just a moment, my darling.

584
00:50:57,278 --> 00:50:59,504
Yes, my sweetheart.

585
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,804
You must promise me
one thing, my darling.

586
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:04,370
What is that, my sweetheart?

587
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:07,566
You must control your
insatiable appetite tonight.

588
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:10,665
Oh, I promise not to eat
any starters whatsoever,

589
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,044
my sweetheart.

590
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:13,497
I don't mean food, my darling.

591
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:15,845
I mean.

592
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,419
Sex, sex, sex.

593
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:20,711
Oh, dear.

594
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:23,810
This is a very
important occasion.

595
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,134
And we cannot afford
do jeopardize it.

596
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:28,545
But how could we
possibly jeopardize

597
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:30,966
the Prince's birthday?

598
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:34,477
I refer to the loan our
country's trying to obtain

599
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:35,518
from the king.

600
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,447
We must be on our best
behavior tonight.

601
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,892
Well then, you stick
very close to me, darling,

602
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,175
and you protect me.

603
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:43,434
You know how the slightest.

604
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,719
Little thing can just
set me right off.

605
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,729
I will, my darling.

606
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,125
Now, well, get in.

607
00:51:53,554 --> 00:51:54,789
Get in.

608
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,095
Yes, yes, yes.

609
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:57,403
Open the door, you fool.

610
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:02,635
Swine.

611
00:52:09,605 --> 00:52:12,437
Get off, coachman, get off.

612
00:52:50,448 --> 00:52:51,511
Hit those rocks.

613
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:54,271
Darling, control yourself.

614
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:55,505
I can't.

615
00:52:57,951 --> 00:52:59,950
Oh here, hold my hands.

616
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:03,338
Now hold my breasts.

617
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,208
Sit still.

618
00:53:06,723 --> 00:53:08,707
Take your hands off me.

619
00:53:10,402 --> 00:53:11,467
Halt.

620
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,624
Don't.

621
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,142
Stop.

622
00:53:17,108 --> 00:53:18,151
Don't.

623
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:19,942
Stop.

624
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:22,312
Don't.

625
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:25,607
Stop, stop.

626
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:47,773
Oh, oh, oh yes,
ride me hard, yes.

627
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:53,185
I've got something of a tummy.

628
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:55,298
Oh yes, oh yes.

629
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,166
Wait a little for me wait.

630
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:01,255
Oh yeah, yeah.

631
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:02,125
Wait, wait.

632
00:54:58,923 --> 00:55:01,790
Damn Prince's skateboard.

633
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:04,919
How quaint.

634
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:12,068
You shall pay for
your clumsiness.

635
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:14,105
Both of you.

636
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:03,839
We're going to the ball.

637
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,709
Or you think I'm going to the ball.

638
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:30,963
Let the dancing begin.

639
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,318
Oh no.

640
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,361
Ha.

641
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:37,860
Look at him.

642
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,200
He's gorgeous.

643
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,761
What do you think?

644
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:47,805
10 inches?

645
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,167
Quite cute.

646
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,080
Eight inches, no more.

647
00:58:57,512 --> 00:58:58,575
10.

648
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,665
Eight.

649
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:00,682
10.

650
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:01,868
Eight.

651
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:04,215
Nine and a half at least.

652
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,503
The Prince will now choose a
partner for the next dance.

653
01:00:00,504 --> 01:00:01,547
Shmuck.

654
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,660
I've met all the beautiful
maidens of the Kingdom.

655
01:00:40,661 --> 01:00:43,614
But never have I seen you before.

656
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:44,920
I know.

657
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:47,681
You're a visitor from
another Kingdom.

658
01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:49,787
No, my Prince.

659
01:00:49,788 --> 01:00:51,651
What is your name?

660
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,871
My name is Cinde...
Never mind.

661
01:00:54,872 --> 01:00:56,323
The night is young.

662
01:00:56,324 --> 01:00:58,696
You will tell me later.

663
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,217
I love the mystery about you.

664
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:05,693
Tonight, I dance with no one else.

665
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,589
If I can't play in the palace,

666
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,067
I'm gonna rob it.

667
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:33,524
If I can't be a king, I'm
sure I don't smell like one.

668
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:47,880
I bet he likes dogs.

669
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:49,163
Right.

670
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:50,252
That's why...

671
01:02:50,253 --> 01:02:51,588
Why are we doing here?

672
01:02:51,616 --> 01:02:53,497
This dog show here today.

673
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:54,541
Creep.

674
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,170
And now, fair ladies,
the game you've been

675
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:02,963
waiting for all evening.

676
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:04,609
Backgammon.

677
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,037
Here are the rules.

678
01:03:06,038 --> 01:03:09,233
When the pointer spins
and points at a maiden,

679
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:11,920
she will come behind
the screen to my bed

680
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,180
and them bow to my wishes.

681
01:03:15,237 --> 01:03:18,142
I will now put my blindfold on.

682
01:03:18,143 --> 01:03:22,184
Any of you who do not
wish to play the game,

683
01:03:22,185 --> 01:03:23,589
may leave.

684
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,934
And forever hold your piece.

685
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,494
You play it down on my
gal, I'll pull your ass

686
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:40,327
all over your head and
make your dumb ass.

687
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,218
You.

688
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:45,937
Now get out.

689
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:05,768
Hello.

690
01:12:12,924 --> 01:12:15,010
Don't smear my lipstick.

691
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:45,436
Oh not me.

692
01:15:04,974 --> 01:15:06,765
The sensation.

693
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:07,809
It snaps.

694
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:15,498
Fairy, fairy Godmother.

695
01:15:16,377 --> 01:15:19,070
Yes, he gave me snapping pussy.

696
01:15:21,678 --> 01:15:23,783
A snapping pussy.

697
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:26,471
The Kingdom has a snapper.

698
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:30,489
A snapper, the Kingdom
has a snapper.

699
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,533
Chamberlain.

700
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:35,835
A snapper.

701
01:15:43,436 --> 01:15:45,612
Do you know what I'm smelling.

702
01:15:45,614 --> 01:15:48,493
I smell a snapping pussy.

703
01:15:48,494 --> 01:15:51,859
Why you don't got
no snapping pussy.

704
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:57,452
Snapper.

705
01:16:07,935 --> 01:16:09,968
A snapping pussy.

706
01:16:09,969 --> 01:16:11,638
Chamberlain.

707
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:12,680
A snapping.

708
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:18,225
It's time.

709
01:16:20,935 --> 01:16:22,048
It's time.

710
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:23,161
Time up, mama.

711
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,711
Time, time, time.

712
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:27,834
Time, time, time.

713
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:28,878
It's time.

714
01:16:30,012 --> 01:16:31,055
Snapper.

715
01:16:31,056 --> 01:16:32,506
A snapper.

716
01:16:32,507 --> 01:16:33,550
The snapper.

717
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:35,992
Let go, man.

718
01:16:37,107 --> 01:16:38,389
Let go snapper.

719
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,433
Mine.

720
01:16:47,832 --> 01:16:49,417
 In all my years as
king of this land

721
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:50,930
 I've led an unusual life

722
01:16:50,931 --> 01:16:52,474
 I've run into many
a beast in which

723
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:54,488
 Not the least of which is my wife

724
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,280
 But now a young
maiden has come along

725
01:16:56,281 --> 01:16:58,120
 And she's made my spirit rise

726
01:16:58,121 --> 01:16:59,766
 With a rare and wondrous talent

727
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:03,252
 That lies betwixt her thighs

728
01:17:03,254 --> 01:17:06,121
 Ooh, a snapper

729
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:10,198
 Want to trap her

730
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:11,409
 Although I'm rather envious

731
01:17:11,437 --> 01:17:12,960
 I also brim with pride

732
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,437
 That lucky son-of-a-bitch

733
01:17:14,438 --> 01:17:18,782
 Has found a snapper for his bride

734
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:27,510
 It's always a rare occasion
when the king takes me to bed

735
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:31,574
 Once we're there, I find he's
soft, not only in the head

736
01:17:31,575 --> 01:17:33,729
 But now he swells
about what dwells

737
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,011
 Within this maiden's lap

738
01:17:35,012 --> 01:17:36,828
 The only thing he'll get from her

739
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:39,417
 Is a common case of clap

740
01:17:39,418 --> 01:17:42,460
 Oh, that snapper

741
01:17:45,205 --> 01:17:46,559
 Want to slap her

742
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,103
 If I should catch
her with the king

743
01:17:48,132 --> 01:17:49,755
 I'll tear her limb from limb

744
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:54,101
 And if the Prince is fortunate,
I'll save a piece for him

745
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:28,393
 The royal family's in a state

746
01:18:28,394 --> 01:18:30,306
 That's best described as shock

747
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:32,017
 The Prince is running
through the halls

748
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:33,720
 Behaving like a schmuck

749
01:18:33,721 --> 01:18:35,245
 The king is fleeing
from the Queen

750
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:37,133
 Not anxious to be crowned

751
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:41,054
 The mystery wench departed
and she's nowhere to be found

752
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:44,614
 Oh, that snapper

753
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:47,930
 We'll kidnap her

754
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:50,569
 The Prince must now conduct
a search through hovels

755
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:51,731
 Homes and huts

756
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:55,629
 In order to retrieve the lass
who sheathed his royal putz

757
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,607
 Oh, that snapper

758
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:02,214
 We'll kidnap her

759
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:04,005
 The Prince will now
conduct a search

760
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:06,063
 Through hovels, homes and huts

761
01:19:06,065 --> 01:19:10,409
 In order to retrieve the lass
who sheathed his royal putz

762
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:19,078
Good news travels fast.

763
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:20,122
I know.

764
01:20:22,687 --> 01:20:27,673
Why don't you put inside
where it's a little stabler.

765
01:20:27,674 --> 01:20:30,215
Then you know what we seek?

766
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:32,442
If this glass slipper
should fit one

767
01:20:32,443 --> 01:20:34,597
of your lovely daughters,
then they will the bride

768
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:35,814
of the Prince.

769
01:20:37,478 --> 01:20:41,109
That is, if they can
pass the final test.

770
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,413
A final test?

771
01:20:43,725 --> 01:20:46,289
My good man, why don't
we leave the Prince

772
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,856
and your lovely daughters alone.

773
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:52,076
I'm sure they'd be
more at ease that way.

774
01:20:52,077 --> 01:20:56,422
Oh of course, my Lord.

775
01:21:16,673 --> 01:21:18,391
Is it nice there in the palace?

776
01:21:18,392 --> 01:21:20,564
Will I like living there?

777
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:24,831
It fits both of you.

778
01:21:26,672 --> 01:21:28,583
Tell the truth, girls.

779
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,683
Were one of you one of the ones

780
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:35,265
who left me behind
that screen during

781
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:37,614
our little game last night?

782
01:21:37,615 --> 01:21:39,787
Yes we were, my Prince.

783
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,345
When she held me with you
know, it was like a vice.

784
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,363
Her charms did indeed snap at me.

785
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,267
Well mine snaps and crackles.

786
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:55,657
And mine pops.

787
01:21:57,027 --> 01:21:58,331
We shall see.

788
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:01,134
We shall see.

789
01:22:08,187 --> 01:22:11,055
What exactly is it that you do?

790
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:15,979
Not even pop?

791
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:23,439
How many people would have to die

792
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,264
before I became king?

793
01:22:32,543 --> 01:22:34,260
Do you feel it snap?

794
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,737
No.

795
01:22:40,142 --> 01:22:41,185
Crackle?

796
01:22:41,186 --> 01:22:42,273
No.

797
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:10,574
No, no more.

798
01:23:10,575 --> 01:23:12,801
I've been searching for days now.

799
01:23:12,802 --> 01:23:14,835
Not only can't I find my snapper,

800
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:16,921
I can't find my pee-pee.

801
01:23:30,016 --> 01:23:31,830
His Majesty, the Prince.

802
01:23:31,831 --> 01:23:33,840
Oh, the Prince do.

803
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:36,454
Come in, do.

804
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:38,279
Yes, yes, the Prince.

805
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:42,482
Your Highness.

806
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,303
Prince-y, not quite king sized.

807
01:24:02,093 --> 01:24:06,135
You remember my daughters
at the ball that night.

808
01:24:06,136 --> 01:24:08,120
Could I ever forget them.

809
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,775
Oh we're so happy, my Prince.

810
01:24:11,776 --> 01:24:13,156
Yes, we waited so long.

811
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:14,729
Never mind all this.

812
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,423
Ladies, please.

813
01:24:16,424 --> 01:24:18,335
Try the slippers, yes.

814
01:24:22,017 --> 01:24:23,129
Give me that.

815
01:24:26,326 --> 01:24:30,670
Oh, playful lot, eh?

816
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,399
Looks right.

817
01:24:41,336 --> 01:24:43,901
I guess my feet swelled up
from dancing last night.

818
01:24:43,902 --> 01:24:46,153
I'm sure if we try tomorrow.

819
01:24:46,154 --> 01:24:48,477
Never mind tomorrow,
give me that.

820
01:24:51,235 --> 01:24:52,277
Phew.

821
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:05,469
Oh, they say
that glass shrinks at night

822
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,815
or the daylight sometimes.

823
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,840
Let us be off, Chamberlain.

824
01:25:10,841 --> 01:25:12,292
Not yet, my Prince.

825
01:25:12,293 --> 01:25:13,336
Not yet?

826
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,473
But there's nothing left of me.

827
01:25:20,258 --> 01:25:22,517
There's one maiden left.

828
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:26,794
Oh, don't worry about her.

829
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:28,634
My Lord, she's never had on shoes,

830
01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:31,297
let alone glass slippers.

831
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:33,790
Anyway, she never
went to the ball.

832
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:35,921
I should say not.

833
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:38,753
But I remember giving
her an invitation myself.

834
01:25:38,754 --> 01:25:40,144
Come here, girl.

835
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:56,211
Let her sit.

836
01:26:29,062 --> 01:26:32,103
I know the slipper fits, my dear.

837
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,257
What did you say your name was?

838
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:38,913
My name is Cinde...

839
01:26:38,914 --> 01:26:40,197
Never mind, girl.

840
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:42,370
It's no use, it's no use.

841
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,394
You couldn't possibly be the one.

842
01:26:46,395 --> 01:26:49,881
What I mean is, you could
hardly be the one who,

843
01:26:49,882 --> 01:26:52,402
who possesses, possesses the.

844
01:26:58,718 --> 01:26:59,760
Oh no.

845
01:27:01,623 --> 01:27:02,665
Oh no, no.

846
01:27:21,157 --> 01:27:22,981
You can't be the one.

847
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:25,952
No, no, no.

848
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:30,842
No, you, no.

849
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:35,273
No, no, no.

850
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:38,419
No, no, yes.

851
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,847
Yes, yes, yes.

852
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:48,568
Yes, yes, yes.

853
01:27:51,249 --> 01:27:52,465
Yes, yes, yes.

854
01:27:55,026 --> 01:27:56,243
She's the one.

855
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:58,875
She's my snapper.

856
01:28:07,711 --> 01:28:10,291
Why didn't you bother to tell me,

857
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:14,636
she was the one with the
snapping pussy.

858
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:21,137
She was always my favorite.

859
01:28:21,138 --> 01:28:23,073
She's my favorite.

860
01:28:23,074 --> 01:28:26,116
Hop on my children, hop on, hop on.

861
01:28:27,284 --> 01:28:28,588
Do it, do it.

862
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,785
Oh, look at all the commotion.

863
01:29:12,786 --> 01:29:15,859
It must be the pleasure fair.

864
01:29:15,861 --> 01:29:18,763
Oh looks like
it is the end of my roots.

865
01:29:52,996 --> 01:29:54,213
Off with it.

866
01:30:09,193 --> 01:30:10,498
It's my fairy Godmother.

867
01:30:10,499 --> 01:30:11,685
We've got to save him.

868
01:30:11,686 --> 01:30:12,919
Your what?

869
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,745
I'll explain later.

870
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:17,377
Halt.

871
01:30:32,482 --> 01:30:34,951
What has this man done?

872
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:37,928
Last night at the great ball
in your honor, my Prince,

873
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:40,035
he cleaned out the palace.

874
01:30:40,036 --> 01:30:43,835
Furs, shawls, all
matter of perfumes,

875
01:30:43,836 --> 01:30:46,617
and above all, the royal jewels.

876
01:30:49,138 --> 01:30:51,049
Oh yes, two corn cobs.

877
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,602
But my dear, this
is a serious offense.

878
01:30:58,603 --> 01:31:02,259
My Prince, I beseech
thee, it wasn't for him

879
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,244
we'd never have met.

880
01:31:04,245 --> 01:31:06,156
What are you saying?

881
01:31:07,102 --> 01:31:09,304
He gave the one who
gave me the snapper.

882
01:31:09,305 --> 01:31:10,347
He what?

883
01:31:12,403 --> 01:31:15,705
You release him,
or no more snapper.

884
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,285
Release that man.

885
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:20,545
He's in my protection now.

886
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:24,632
Goodbye, fairy friend.

887
01:31:30,293 --> 01:31:33,198
Which of you honkies got my bag?

888
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,328
Here it is.

889
01:31:36,613 --> 01:31:38,698
Thank you one and all.

890
01:31:52,276 --> 01:31:54,018
Wait for me, mama.

891
01:31:54,019 --> 01:31:55,084
I'm going with you.

892
01:31:55,085 --> 01:31:57,003
Just one time, I don't
mind riding at the back

893
01:31:57,031 --> 01:31:58,642
of the coach.

894
01:32:18,712 --> 01:32:20,454
Snap on now.

895
01:32:20,456 --> 01:32:23,168
Snap on.

896
01:32:33,505 --> 01:32:37,183
And Cinderella lived
happily ever after,

897
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:41,529
thanks to my snap judgment.

897
01:32:42,305 --> 01:33:42,905
