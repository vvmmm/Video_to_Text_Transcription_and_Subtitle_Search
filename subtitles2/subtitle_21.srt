00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,885
-[Jason] Bit of wildlife?
-Yes.

00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,178
-Have you fast-forwarded?
-Yeah.

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,679
-No animals die?
-No.

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,139
Okay, good. [sighs]

5
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,307
Gecko maybe.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,684
Oh, no, that's okay.
I can't really warm to geckos.

-Aw.
-What?

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,984
I just feel sorry for fish.
They always look so cold.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,445
I mean, it's no life, is it?

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,241
What's it like having empathy
for every single thing?

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,993
Oh, God, Jason,
it is absolutely exhausting.

13
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,828
I can't even look at elephants anymore.

14
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:38,997
[phone chimes]

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,749
Who's that?

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,835
-Oh, it's Penny.
-What'd she say?

17
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,462
She's gonna pop by tomorrow.
She's got some news.

18
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,922
[cell phone rings]

19
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,007
-She didn't say what?
-No.

20
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,717
[stammers, sighs]

21
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,802
Hello, Mum. You all right?

22
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,346
He won't try anything new,
so I'm going on my own.

23
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,474
Spain, Jason, Spain!
She's gonna get herself killed!

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,352
It's a walking holiday in Alicante, Dad.
No one's getting killed.

25
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,272
I wanna have experiences!
I wanna live an impulsive life!

26
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,568
I wanna eat a bull's testicle
and flamenco!

27
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,611
-[Vic] Your mum's gone mad, Jason.
-[mouths] Bull's testicle?

28
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,321
-Don't know.
-Did I tell you about vanilla essence?

29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,698
Oh, for God's sake.

30
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:18,245
There's vanilla essence in the cupboard.
Nine years old, barely used.

31
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,748
If I bake at the current rate,
I'll die before it's empty.

32
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,793
Outlived by vanilla essence!

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,838
Okay, fine!

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,133
I'm happy to consider more decking
in the back garden!

35
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,720
Not decking, Vic. I'm sick of decking.

36
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,139
You can't keep throwing decking
at the problem.

37
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,309
And she's gone.

38
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,021
You know, it won't kill us
to be a bit more impulsive.

39
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,692
[clicks tongue]

40
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,695

Yeah, you just pick up the car
outside terminal 4.

43
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,593
Yeah, no, I know. I get confused
in arrivals and departures too.

'Cause, you know,
I'm arriving at the airport. [chuckles]

Aw, thanks. I think you're
a really unique person too. [chuckles]

Okay, bye. Enjoy your car.

-Hey. You know Richard's leaving?
-Really?

00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,776
Are you gonna go for his job?

Jen. [chuckles]
They're never gonna let me be a manager.

50
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,697
Why do you think they're better than us?

51
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,409
All right, Richard drives a Volvo estate.
They're not astronauts.

[Jen] Hello. Thanks for waiting.

00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,712
Uh, yeah, you were just in a queue, so...

56
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,050
[chuckles] Right, I mean,
I think if you hate queues this much,

-Hi, Raina.
-Hi.

60
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,454
-Who's that?
-My auntie.

61
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,497
Hey, guys. How are you?

62
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,499
So is your dad not picking you up anymore?

63
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,750
No.

64
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,921
-[sighs] Maybe drop-offs?
-No, he has a new job.

65
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,716
Well, sometimes daddies have to work.

66
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,095
It doesn't mean he doesn't love us.
I mean, you.

67
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,431
Doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,226
Okay, okay, off you go.

69

Hey! Oh.

00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,692
[Raina] Bye.

Jason?

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,752
Your bathroom needed retiling.

76
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,755
Oh. Okay.

77
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,926
Thank you. [breathes heavily]

78
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,888
-Hiya.
-Jase.

79
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,765
-What?
-Why is your dad retiling our bathroom?

80
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,642
-Is he okay?
-Listen, don't rock the boat.

81
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,853
Those are the sorts of questions we can
get into once we have a retiled bathroom.

82
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,564
-[doorbell buzzes]
-Oh, no, I'm nervous.

83
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,774
Oh, I know, I know.

84
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,693
-Okay, all right. I'm gonna get that.
-Okay, yeah.

85
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,244
[Nikki] Hello, Penny.

86
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,954
-Do you wanna come in?
-Yes, please.

87
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,872
[Nikki speaks indistinctly]

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,916
[door closes]

89
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,379
[Vic] Your carpet trim needs doing now.
I'm never getting away!

90
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,130
Sorry. My mum's away. I think he's lonely.

91
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,799
Yeah. [chuckles]

92
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,552
So, what's going on?

93
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,804
Right, uh, we don't have much time.
[stammers]

94
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,098
Can I be blunt? Don't answer that.
We don't have the time.

95
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,391
I'm going to be blunt.

96
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,895
The local authority are now considering
another family for Princess.

97
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,274
-Oh.
-Oh.

98
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,358
Why?

99
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,988
Well, an opportunity has arisen to place
Princess and her brother together,

100
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,116
and they would love to keep these children
together if at all possible.

101
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,620
And, look, I know it's hard,
but I would urge you, if you can,

102
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,790
to look inside yourselves and summon
the courage to see this as good news,

103
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,169
-because it-- it is, for them.
-[sighs]

104
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,338
I mean, it's not-- It's not hard, is it?
I mean, we saw 'em together.

105
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:42,259
-It's not-- It's not hard, but... [sighs]
-I mean... [chuckles] ...it's a bit hard.

106
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
Mmm.

107
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,803
[Penny] I know.

108
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,309
[clicks tongue, chuckles]
Could we not take them both?

109
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,770
Oh. Taking two children,
that's a mammoth undertaking.

110
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,025
And I should know. I have brought up two
happy, friendly, well-adjusted children...

111
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,109
out of four.

112
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,320
We-- We could do it. I know we could.

113
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,779
Not to mention
there's a question of space.

114
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,782
Ah, we have space. Penny!
We have-- We have space.

115
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,285
-[Jason] Do we?
-Yeah, absolutely.

116
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,997
I mean, Penny, it's bigger than it looks.
It's just-- It's just messy.

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,124
They usually require each child
to have their own room.

118
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,169
-Jason, help me pick some of this up.
-What's under there? A third bedroom?

119
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,921
Oh! Maybe they could sleep in our bed.

120
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,380
We could have the sofa.

121
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,049
-We sleep on the sofa quite a lot.
-See?

122
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,220
As convincing as all these plans sound,
listen, we have to let this play out.

123
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,721
This is a process.

124
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,516
Ebb and flow,
and we are in the ebbiest of ebbs.

125
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,851
You must just stay strong.

126
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,438
Lean on each other, and I will call
as soon as we know the decision.

127
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,732
Is there anyone who can support you
over the next few weeks?

128
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,526
Someone who'd understand?

129
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,946
-Where's your angle driver?
-[Jason] I haven't got an angle driver.

130
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,240
How can you not have an angle driver?

131
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,158
I suppose I can make do
with your diamond core drill.

132
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,785
I haven't got one of those either.

133
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,913
You're not using an SDS drill
for masonry work, are ya?

134
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,289
Who do you think I am, Dad?

135
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,959
Sorry. Vic, can you--
Can you give us a minute, please?

136
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,503
What's the matter?

137
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,381
They found someone that can take
both Princess and her brother.

138
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,467
-Why don't you take 'em?
-Each child has to have their own room.

139
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,011
Why? I never did. Never have.

140
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,597
I had a brother, and then I got married.

141
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,850
What's rooms got to do with it?

142
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,185
The queen's got hundreds of rooms.
Look at her kids.

143
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,271
-All simpletons and perverts.
-Dad, can we have a minute?

144
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,524
-Thick as mince, the lot of 'em.
-Please, Dad. Just... Thank you.

145
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,279
Would he be spending a lot of time
with the children, or...

146
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,114
Not unsupervised, no. No.

147
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,785
No,
it's good that they get to stay together.

148
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,371
[inhales] We want what's best for them.

149
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455
-Don't we?
-Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,916
I will call you
as soon as we know the decision.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,376
Thanks, Penny.

152
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,047
Can we just give them a bit of space?

153
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,303
It's all right. It's all right. Hey.

154
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,763
Come on.

155
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,515
We just keep going.

156
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,268
-All right? We just keep going.
-[sighs] I'm so tired.

157
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,772
So, why aren't you in Spain, then?

158
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,484
Not for me.

159
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,699
Okay. [sighs]

160
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,166
-She doesn't want me there.
-Did she invite you?

161
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,713
She's changed a bit.

162
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,133
Yeah, they do that, people.

163
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,638
She wants to dance the flamenco.

164
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,390
Can you see me doing that?

165
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,602
[inhales] Now you listen to me.

166
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,524
All I had to show for being 60
was an addiction to antique gravy boats,

167
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,526
a husband gayer than Adele's entourage

168
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,694
and a sharp, shooting pain
when I look to the left.

169
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,323
Four years later, I have slept with
two members of the shadow cabinet,

170
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,574
and I'm not done yet.

171
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,159
Had cancer, beaten cancer,

172
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,454
regained full neck rotation,
learned Korean...

173
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,997
[speaks Korean]

174
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,083
...and saved over 30 kids
from at-risk homes

175
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,086
because I am the best bloody
child and families social worker

176
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,921
in North East London.

177
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,633
No one's laminated my life story yet,
nor yours.

178
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,388
The next time I see you,
you'd better have something pierced.

179
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,348
Either that
or a shirt with some color in it.

180
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,476
[sighs]

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,563
-Okay.
-Oh, my goodness!

182
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,524
What is the one thing that we need
to be able to take these kids?

183
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,445
Money, experience, preparation,
approval from social services--

184
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,780
Exactly. Another bedroom.

185
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,700
So, why don't we just rent somewhere
with three bedrooms?

186
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,243
-With whose money, Nik?
-Mine.

187
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,288
There's a management position
opening at work. I'm gonna go for it.

188
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,914
I thought you said
you were happy where you were.

189
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,917
Nope. It's time to make a move.
I need to take control of my life,

190
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,712
and I need to stop relying
on other people all of the time.

191
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,255
-[sighs]
-[spits]

192
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,048
-Can I borrow your laptop?
-Go on then.

193
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,718
Oh, "Operation Rent A Bigger Flat"
starts here.

194
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,471
You know you don't call the operation
the actual thing you're doing.

195
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,556
What?

196
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,017
Well, it needs a code name.
Otherwise, what's the point?

197
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,269
-What you talking about?
-Operation Valkyrie wasn't called,

198
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,479
"Operation
Let's Secretly Kill Adolf Hitler," was it?

199
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,399
Oh, God, Jase. You're really taking
all the fun out of this, aren't you?

200
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,276
-[exhales]
-[sighs]

201
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,198
Oh, bloody hell. Three grand a month?

202
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,092
Oh, my God.

203
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,344
I hit rock bottom, Nikki.

204
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,971
I got so drunk on Monday,

205
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,058
-I went home with a zone five.
-[gasps]

206
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,228
It has got to stop.
I am not yet the best I can be.

207
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
-Your hair is amazing.
-Thanks, I needed it.

208
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,065
I was carrying a lot of trauma
in my fringe.

209
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,191
[chuckles]

210
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,318
Also, I decided...

211
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,237
I'm going for the promotion. [chuckles]

212
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,697
Oh, okay.

213
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,034
I cannot still be sat here answering
phones in this job in my 30s, Nikki.

214
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,702
-I'd kill myself.
-Yeah.

215
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,287
And management get flexi-hours.

216
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,915
I could finally get out of this crazy
ten-to-four grind.

217
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,751
Jen, you know they're not the hours
that we're actually supposed to--

218
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,795
Plus, I forgot my phone yesterday.

219
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,630
So I had to work, and you know what?

220
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,382
I didn't totally hate it.

221
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,175
I thought
if you're not going for it, then--

222
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,511
Okay, yeah, um... [smacks lips]

223
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,054
The thing is, I... [chuckles]

224
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,557
I actually thought
that I might go for it too.

225
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,226
-Really?
-Yeah, is-- is that okay?

226
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,103
Oh, my God, of course!

227
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,147
Turns out we need a bigger flat or
we're not gonna get the kids that we want.

228
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,941
Also, you get a personal laptop.

229
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,986
So you can look at porn
without having to disable the IP address.

230
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,489
-Yeah, and there's that.
-Mmm.

231
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,036
Hello. Vista Car Rental,
Jennifer speaking. How may I help you?

232
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,499
[Karen]
Thanks for coming in at short notice.

233
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,087
I just think
we have a real talent on our hands.

234
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,840
What is it? A hippo?

235
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,508
No, it's a house.

236
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:03,932
Oh. Okay. [inhales] Okay.

237
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,353
So is this all you wanted?

238
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,064
I mean, I left work early, so, um--

239
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,152
Well, the school doesn't see
this kind of talent very often.

240
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,155
I mean,
we did have a county shot-putter once,

241
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,409
but that was largely a thyroid issue, and,
uh, she left under a cloud anyway, so.

242
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,165
No, I mean, this is a fish she's done.

243
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,670
She's got real movement in the hair.

244
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,841
Isn't that where she just leant on it?

245
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,260
And all the teachers love her.

246
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,848
Mainly because she doesn't really
say much, but that's a gift in itself.

247
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,269
And...
her face is always spotless after lunch.

248
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,192
-Well, she's obviously a talent.
-Mm-hmm.

249
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,487
Maybe we should meet up
and put a plan together.

250
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,406
For the talent nurturing.

251
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,284
Sure. Yes.

252
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,162
Drink tomorrow?

253
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,248
We can meet
at The Camden Assembly at 6:00.

254
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,832
Right, okay. Yes.

255
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,628
-See you there.
-See you there.

256
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,883
Oh. Thank you.

257
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,681
Even if you get your new promotion,
we can't afford any of these. Look.

258
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,558
Can you not look further out of London?

259
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,226
I've gone down as far as Brighton.
Nothing.

260
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,061
-Well, go further.
-Well, you can't.

261
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,145
Why?

262
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,398
'Cause that's the sea.

263
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,649
Then France.

264
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,026
Then it starts getting
more expensive again.

265
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,236
[groans]

266
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,905
How's your Albanian?

267
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,675
[typing]

268
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,598
Oh! [pants]

269
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,682
Hello, Vic.

270
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,601
Socket needed rewiring.

271
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,021
Right.
I thought Jason said he'd fixed that.

272
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,732
-We have different standards.
-Ah.

273
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,694
New shirt?

274
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,112
Uh, yeah.

275
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,824
Very nice. Snazzy. [chuckles]

276
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,576
Got my job interview today.

277
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,496
They got rid of lever arch files,
and the world went to shit.

278
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,582
Yeah.

279
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,419
-Sorry about that.
-Not your fault.

280
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,298
Right. Have a nice day.

281
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,805
Oh, my God. He's here. Again.

282
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,558
He's got a couple of things
to take care of, then he's gonna go.

283
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,519
-He won't be long.
-He's left stuff in the freezer.

284
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,229
And tins. Look.

285
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,983
Oh, my God. What is happening
to this flat? [breathes heavily]

286
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,111
Where are my keys? [stammers]
Oh! [chuckles]

287
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,572
Oh, good luck with
"Operation Nikki Gets a Promotion Day."

288
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,783
-See? It's clearer, isn't it?
-Oh-- Oh, God, yeah.

289
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,744
Don't forget we've got a viewing
on that Mayfield Street place at 6:00.

290
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,704
-Okay. It's definitely three bedrooms?
-[Jason] Yeah.

291
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,082
-How is that in our budget?
-Dunno. Maybe it's a murder house.

292
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,460
Fine. It'll have been deep cleaned then,
won't it? Okay.

293
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:19,962
-I love you.
-I love you.

294
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,255
Listen, good luck, all right?

295
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,048
-[groans]
-You're gonna be great.

296
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,384
-Bye, Vic.
-See ya.

297
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,221
[door opens, closes]

298
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,976
All right, I'm gonna finish this,
then shoot off.

299
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,104
-All right.
-I've got other things to do, you know?

300
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,523
You know you can just pop over
and say hello, you know?

301
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,441
And have a chat. Y-you haven't--

302
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,526
What about?

303
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,529
Well, I don't know. General chat.

304
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,786
-You all right, then?
-Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,917
-You?
-Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,220
Actually, would you mind
having a look at the toaster?

307
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,639
-It's not catching or something.
-That'll be a latch release.

308
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,143
-Ah. Is that what it is?
-Yeah. Probably.

309
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,107
-You heard from your mum then?
-No.

310
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,317
She's only been gone, what, two--

311
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,277
-Nearly three days.
-Okay.

312
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
Why don't you give her a call? Huh?

313
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,825
Nah. It's been a blessing, the quiet.

314
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,790
-All right. I'll leave you to it.
-She says she regrets her life.

315
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,754
But I've been her whole life.

316
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,174
I don't think she regrets
the things that she's done.

317
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,385
I think that she regrets the things
that she hasn't done. You know?

318
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,514
It's about adding things, innit?
Not taking away, you know?

319
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,309
I think-- I think you need to, um,
you need someone who adds things.

320
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,435
-Do I?
-Yeah.

321
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,231
Yeah. I think-- I think it's good for you.
I think it helps you grow and all that.

322
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,526
It's fun, innit, you know?

323
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,569
Watching someone grow. Change.

324
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,657
'Cause you never know
what they're gonna turn into.

325
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,410
[metal clinks]

326
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,079
All right then, mate.

327
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,633
I started here five years ago
as a lowly customer service assistant.

328
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,469
You're still a customer service assistant.

329
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,179
That's correct.

330
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:38,267
And that gives me a unique insight.
Uh, let me give you an example.

331
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,521
Who do we rent cars to? Drivers.

332
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,567
What do drivers want? Cars.

333
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,654
And what do they not have
when they call us? Cars.

334
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,490
[chuckles] So how are they getting here?

335
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,994
Do you know how many people
have decided not to hire a car with us

336
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,290
when I've told them we don't pick them up
or drop them off? Loads.

337
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,210
So much business, lost.
Literally thousands of pounds.

338
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:10,090
-So, the first thing that I would do if--
-Wait. We do pick customers up.

339
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,844
-What?
-We offer pickups and drop-offs.

340
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,389
We rolled that out about 18 months ago.
Have you... [chuckles]

341
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,225
Have you not been telling people
that we do that?

342
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,686
Um... [inhales]

343
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,989
How'd it go?

344
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,909
-Really well. [chuckles]
-Yay. [chuckles]

345
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,536
It was tough,
but I managed to convince them. [chuckles]

346
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,871
What, to give you the job?

347
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,581
No, to keep my current one.

348
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,958
[chuckles] It was touch and go
for a while.

349
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,337
[smacks lips] I think my luck is changing.

350
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,298
This could be the start
of something really good for me.

351
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,674
[chuckles]

352
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,303
Hello. Vista Car Rental, Jen speaking.
How may I help you?

353
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:16,657
All right, let's start. This is Lucy from
the Reading branch, and Debbie's from HR.

354
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,992
She has to be here
because of Weinstein and that.

355
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,329
We'll just let you
make yourself comfortable.

356
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,830
She's fine. We're all fine.

357
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,751
Okay. Why don't you start by telling us
why you'd like a move into management?

358
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:32,756
Yes.
Well, um, as a customer sales executive,

359
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,050
I have extensive sales experience,

360
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,219
an intimate knowledge of the business,

361
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,596
a-- a good relationship
with existing clients.

362
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,932
Um, I-I work well as-- as a team,

363
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:47,312
but, um, you know, also
as a-- as-- as an individual. [chuckles]

364
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,316
[chuckles] Sorry.

365
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,945
Oh, my God.
No, I don't know what I'm talking about.

366
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,780
Um... [breathes deeply]

367
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,534
I-- I hate all that. I'm just--

368
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,452
I'm just gonna talk normally.

369
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,331
I'm not a customer sales executive.
I work on the phones.

370
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,749
There's nothing wrong with that,

371
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,919
but I've--
I've got some really good ideas, Terry.

372
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,422
And no, I-- I've not much
management experience,

373
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,967
but Richard has an MBA, and his
computer's been on for five straight years

374
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,760
because
he doesn't know how to log back in. So...

375
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,889
You know, I mean,
where has that got you? [chuckles]

376
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,850
Right. First, we've got to--

377
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,644
We've got to change the--
the hall music, Terry.

378
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,521
E-everyone's complaining about it.

379
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,191
Why don't we provide car seats
for children

380
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,359
and do pickups on a Sunday evening?

381
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,282
Stop being horrible to our customers.
Just let scratches go.

382
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,701
Stop cheating people on the extra cover.

383
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:47,623
Oh, and d-do not--
Do not launch a promotion on a Monday,

384
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,709
'cause half the sales are 23,
and they're off with hangovers.

385
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,960
You don't know stuff like this

386
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,213
unless you've been out there
for eight years, Terry.

387
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,590
What's your view
on the sustainability report?

388
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,301
Have you got the, uh... [inhales]

389
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,637
-Where's the... [sighs]
-It's in the shared folder on the G drive.

390
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,222
What?

391
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,058
-On the desktop.
-Right.

392
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,354
-No. Uh, on your computer.
-Jeez. [sighs]

393
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,483
God. They got rid of lever arch files,
and the world went to shit. [chuckles]

394
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,861
-[snaps] Yes. Thank you. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

395
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,493
Did they say when you might hear?

396
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,871
Oh, ages. Honestly, Jase,
I'm just glad I didn't embarrass myself.

397
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,374
[sighs] It's not very "us"
around here, is it, Nik?

398
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,751
-I mean, it's a bit coconut latte-ey.
-Mmm.

399
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,129
I looked it up,
and no one's been stabbed here since 2016.

400
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,924
I mean, that's just weird.
You want a stabbin' every six months.

401
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,676
Otherwise, the house prices spiral.

402
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,929
No, I love it. Camden's so grubby.

403
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,931
I'd love our kids
to be able to walk to school

404
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,642
without being offered weed
or knockoff trainers.

405
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,310
-You talking about Sneaky Steve?
-Yes.

406
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:53,146
That guy's a legend. He can get you
literally any shoe you want.

407
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,649
Yeah, but where is he getting them from?
That's my question.

408
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,776
'Cause they're not new.

409
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,946
-My Reebok Classic had a sock in it.
-[chuckles]

410
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,323
And our flat's literally falling apart.

411
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,033
-God, it is nice, isn't it?
-Yeah.

412
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,289
[sighs]

413
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,834
-Hello, mate.
-Hello.

414
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:14,918
-Hello.
-Nikki.

415
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,628
-Yes, Nikki. Yes.
-Jason. What's your name?

416
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,088
-Toby.
-Hello, Toby. How are ya?

417
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,437
-Hello.
-Hiya.

418
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,649
-I-- I'm not coming.
-What?

419
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,611
-I'm not coming.
-But you're here.

420
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,113
Yeah. [chuckles]
But just to tell you I'm not coming.

421
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,658
-Okay.
-Uh, I'm here physically but not morally.

422
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,619
Okay.

423
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,580
Because we're not gonna talk about Raina,
are we?

424
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,123
I mean, we both know.

425
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,001
I-- I've spoken 50 words to you.

426
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,130
I don't even know you.
I don't even know why I'm here.

427
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,465
Well, I didn't think you were.

428
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,843
And they were nice words.

429
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,680
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

430
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,849
-Okay.
-Okay.

431
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,810
See you.

432
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,065
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

433
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,620
-So, um, where are you guys?
-Uh, Camden.

434
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,664
-Camden way, yeah.
-Yeah. It's nice, but, you know.

435
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,376
Yeah. I mean, it's, uh, supposed to be
up-and-coming, isn't it?

436
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,796
But there's still only one bank
and about 12 places to buy a bong.

437
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,381
-Right, yeah. [chuckles]
-[scoffs]

438
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,384
-[mutters]
-Oh, this is lovely.

439
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,468
Wow.

440
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,929
Um, as you can see,
nearly an en-suite, which is good.

441
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,474
And, um, good storage.
And, uh, the garden's south-facing.

442
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,476
-[gasps] Oh, wow. [chuckles]
-[sighs]

443
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,353
Do you guys have a garden yourselves?

444
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,897
No, no. We did have a window box, though.

445
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,899
-But it, uh, it got away from us.
-Mmm.

446
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,818
Okay.
I'll let you guys have a look around.

447
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,403
-All right, mate.
-Make yourselves at home.

448
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,154
-[Jason] Nice one. Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

449
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,868
Oh, my God.

450
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,329
[chuckles]

451
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:19,459
Oh. Bloody hell. [chuckles]

452
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,674
-We love it. [chuckles]
-It sounds terrific, doesn't it?

453
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,635
Amazing. Um, well,
we're looking to move out as soon as.

454
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,513
-So, I-- I'll let the estate agent know.
-All right. Fantastic.

455
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,764
Perfect. You can meet the others.

456
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,266
-The others?
-What you mean?

457
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,517
-Yo.
-Hey, how you?

458
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,602
-Hello. Hi.
-You all right?

459
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,354
This is Nikki and Jason.
They are taking the room.

460
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,439
The room?

461
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,900
-Yay! Yes, come. Come live with us.
-Oh.

462
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,193
-It's really nice.
-"The room."

463
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,819
Apart from the lock on the downstairs
bathroom doesn't work.

464
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,070
I didn't know it was just a room.

465
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,864
So you just have to sing
while you're in there.

466
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,618
-Cheers, mate. We'll be in touch.
-Yeah.

467
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,369
-Thank you.
-Yeah, speak soon.

468
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,121
-Yeah, bye.
-Yeah, lovely. See ya.

469
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,749
Why didn't you read the whole advert?

470
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,876
I saw the word "beautiful"
and jumped straight to the pictures.

471
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,294
Just like everyone else does.

472
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:06,465
Toby. I mean, what sort of name is Toby?
Of all the names you could pick. Toby?

473
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,509
-I stole a guava.
-What? Why?

474
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,886
-Because he slagged off Camden.
-You slagged off Camden.

475
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,388
Yes, I'm allowed to slag off Camden.
It's where I live.

476
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,890
Okay.

477
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,480
-Need any gear, guys?
-No, thanks.

478
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,023
But th-- thank you for asking.

479
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,691
All right, guys. Fancy new trainers?

480
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,109
Read the room, Steve.

481
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,194
[man] Any gear, guys?

482
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,657
Yes, bro. Yeah, new kicks, new kicks.

483
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:39,706
[sighs]

484
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,000
[sighs]

485
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,004
It's not the same, is it?

486
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,089
No.

487
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,383
It's better.

488
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,677
It's a home.

489
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,852
[sighs]

490
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,033
Jason?

491
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,625
-Oh, my-- What?
-[chuckles]

492
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:30,716
-What-- What's he gone and done?
-He's made a third bedroom.

493
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:35,429
-Jason, this is unbelievable.
-[exhales]

494
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,556
-Oh, look. Nikki, Nikki, look.
-Yeah?

495
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,142
He's got some little handles for the--
for their little hands.

496
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,518
Stop it.

497
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,564
This is the maddest...

498
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,650
[smacks lips] ...and the sweetest thing.

499
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,238
-Is it even possible? Um--
-Well, I dunno. [chuckles]

500
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:57,284
It's a three-bedroom flat.
[chuckles] Kind of.

501
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,371
-What's the landlord gonna have to s--
-Ah, let's not, let's not.

502
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,333
Let's just enjoy it for tonight, Jase.

503
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,504
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] My God.

504
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,551
[breathing heavily]

505
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:24,728
Oh.

505
00:27:25,305 --> 00:28:25,660
