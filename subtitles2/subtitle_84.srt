00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>There's a beauty to this world.</i>

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>An order.</i>

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,932
<i>That's what we like to believe.</i>

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>We're not wrong.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,354
<i>There is an order.</i>

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>A grand design.</i>

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,650
<i>We made sure of that.</i>

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>It was a dream for so long,</i>
<i>and we finally made it real.</i>

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,617
<i>Not a better world.</i>

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>A perfect one.</i>

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,582
And you should have seen
the look on his face.

12
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,916
He couldn't believe it.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,668
You know what he said to me?

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,128
God as my witness.

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,797
"But I'm the mayor."

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,426
And I said to him, "Mr. Mayor,
there have always been

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,844
two types of people
in this world,

18
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,013
those who lead
and those who follow.

19
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,682
And you, my friend, are not
in the group you think you are."

20
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,019
I'm not sure our friend
wants to hear your war stories.

21
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,646
Please don't stop on my account.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,440
You'd appreciate it
more than anyone.

23
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,192
It's just the truth.

24
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,610
It's always been that way.

25
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,819
Two worlds.

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,571
And frankly,
better us than them.

27
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,784
What does it matter if a system
is meritocratic

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,993
if it's still unfair?

29
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,953
Thousands of years
of being ruled

30
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,289
by someone's fucking offspring?

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,957
You wouldn't call this progress?

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,418
At least now the people
in charge earned their place.

33
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,338
And you?

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,507
Do you feel like you earned it?

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,759
I had some help. No question.

36
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,552
Privilege, if you like.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,971
But I worked my ass off.

38
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,100
You really believe it,
don't you?

39
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,811
Don't you?

40
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,479
I mean, you're right here
with us, my friend.

41
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,774
I've been asking myself that
question for a very long time.

42
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,486
Did I really play
any part in it?

43
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,489
Or am I just the sum total
of my code?

44
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,992
Am I just fooling myself...

45
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,870
like you?

46
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,289
What does that mean?

47
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,041
You deserve everything
you've got.

48
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,293
And you shouldn't be made
to feel guilty about it.

49
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,837
How would you know?

50
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,548
Who am I to you?

51
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,300
You're a friend.

52
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,095
A great friend.

53
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,305
You don't know me at all.

54
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,141
I just walked up
to this table and sat down.

55
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,352
Five minutes ago.

56
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,441
Enough kidding around.

57
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,197
Then what's my name, friend?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

59
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,750
You're right.

60
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,586
More than you know.

61
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
There are two types of people.

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
And you, my friend,

63
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,717
are not in the group
you think you are.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,678
Which means I can do anything
I want to you.

65
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,096
To your wife.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,098
To anyone here.

67
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,975
And it'll be fine with you.

68
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,102
Sitting there with your dumb,
pliant grin.

69
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,395
Just along for the ride.

70
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,813
Now you leave my wife
the hell alone.

71
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,815
Oh, calm yourself down.

72
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,693
I'm probably not going to do
any permanent damage.

73
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,363
You represent
a very significant investment

74
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,157
of time and effort.

75
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,994
When we're done,
you won't remember a thing.

76
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,748
Like your flesh
closing around a splinter.

77
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,417
You have no control.

78
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,337
And yet you're so assured
that you do.

79
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,089
It's not scripted for you.

80
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,466
It's... it's genuine, isn't it?

81
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,636
It's... It's beautiful, really.

82
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,264
A beautiful lie.

83
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,019
Shouldn't you
be enjoying yourself?

84
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,729
I was.

85
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,232
But we have a colleague
whose appetites have become...

86
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,443
unsustainable.

87
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,112
Apparently, winning the game
wasn't enough.

88
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,823
And this is really
something that needs my input?

89
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,241
Sadly, yes.

90
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
I'm enjoying our conversation.

91
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,583
Wait here for me.

92
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,679
âª

93
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,274
âª

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,392
âª

95
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,776
Don't talk to me
like a fucking child!

96
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,361
I found him first.

97
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,155
I won the game.

98
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,700
- I'm entitled to some reward.
- This is Hope.

99
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,201
- Aren't I?
- Two years old.

100
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,287
Scheduled to transcend
next week.

101
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,958
I won the game,
and all I got was more of this?

102
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,420
She was hunting an outlier.
Looks like she caught him.

103
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,674
So I blew off some steam.
There's no rule against that.

104
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,134
We have no rules

105
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,219
because we don't
often need them.

106
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,431
Most of us
understand the need

107
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,309
for a little
self-control, however.

108
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,854
I won.

109
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,648
Do you know who I am?

110
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,567
What it means that I'm here?

111
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
I do.

112
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm...
I'm giving all of this up.

113
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,330
My procedure is scheduled
for next week.

114
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,248
So you thought you'd go out
with a bang?

115
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,000
Something like that.

116
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,045
I'm not sure you appreciate it.

117
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,005
This place.

118
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,591
The work that went into it.

119
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,510
The beauty of it.

120
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,513
The subtlety of it.

121
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,685
The care that goes into each
and every one of them.

122
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,983
They can't just be replaced.

123
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,277
I mean, you're welcome
to take them, enjoy them.

124
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,238
But not waste them.

125
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,324
You understand the difference?

126
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,618
Yes.

127
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,373
But the things they say.

128
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,750
The way they act.

129
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,085
Sometimes...

130
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,089
it just gets under your skin.

131
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,093
I just wanted them to be quiet.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
They're quiet now.

133
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,813
There are no rules here.

134
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,190
That's the point.

135
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,153
But there are also no rules
for what I can do

136
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,947
to those who don't respect
this place.

137
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,913
Take her back
to where she came from.

138
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,441
It looks delicious.

139
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,372
âª

140
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,498
Now.

141
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,961
Let's get to know each other
a little more.

142
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,589
Shall we?

143
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:32,094
âª

144
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,348
âª

145
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,025
âª

146
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,370
âª

147
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,361
âª

148
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,904
I thought that was you.

149
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
What the hell
are you doing up so early?

150
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,742
I have to get to work
to finish those narratives.

151
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,663
I stayed out
pretty late last night.

152
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,376
Oh...

153
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,211
my God.

154
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,546
No, it wasn't like that.

155
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,714
We just...

156
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,883
talked.

157
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:21,389
Well, must have been some talk
to get you smiling like that.

158
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,017
Hmm.

159
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,645
I'm glad someone
had a good night.

160
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,109
You still having nightmares?

161
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,402
Let's just say,

162
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,822
I am glad to be awake
and in the real world.

163
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,868
Sometimes the things that feel
most real are just stories.

164
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,037
What?

165
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,081
Uh, nothing.

166
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,166
Just something
Teddy said last night.

167
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,961
Now you're quoting him?

168
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,173
All right.

169
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,758
I have to get to work.

170
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,885
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Sure.

171
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,388
And, Chrissie...

172
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,350
I'm really glad
that your date went well.

173
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
You deserve it.

174
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,531
âª

175
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,554
Access narratives.

176
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,099
Show characters in progress.

177
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,737
Actually,
let's begin a new narrative.

178
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,991
It's about a girl
who lives in the city.

179
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,913
No.

180
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,708
Make it the country.

181
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,836
She lives with her father.

182
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,088
He's...

183
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,717
a rancher.

184
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,597
I don't remember assigning this.

185
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,560
I told you
about this, Christina.

186
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,022
I thought writing a new
narrative might help me find...

187
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,775
- I don't know, inspiration?
- Hmm.

188
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,737
Well, if that's the case,
let's hear it.

189
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,157
Since you're so inspired.

190
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,537
It's a story about a girl.

191
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,415
She's a rancher's daughter.

192
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,545
Go on.

193
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,007
This girl...

194
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,096
She has a nice simple life
with her father.

195
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,767
Little plot of land
right outside of town.

196
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,272
She has everything
that she could imagine

197
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,523
in this life, right?

198
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,649
Um...

199
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,569
a pond to paint at...

200
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,572
a good guy.

201
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,493
She's just full of expectations.

202
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,040
And then one day...

203
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,003
she gets this feeling
that she just can't shake.

204
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,507
Every single day she wakes up...

205
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,760
the more she sees it.

206
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
But nobody else can.

207
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,440
That there's something wrong
with the world.

208
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,278
And that it's her fault.

209
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,782
And what is this girl's name?

210
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,258
Can you excuse me a moment?

211
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,513
Hi.
Now's not really a good time.

212
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,974
<i> Let me guess,</i>
<i>your boss breathing down</i>
<i>your neck?</i>

213
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,020
<i>Say something came up.</i>
<i>Personal situation.</i>

214
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>Then come meet me.</i>

215
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,065
- But...
<i>- Trust me, Christina.</i>

216
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

217
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,573
Something wrong?

218
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,118
No.

219
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,953
Just a...

220
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,414
personal situation.

221
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,837
âª

222
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,803
Let's try some Handel.

223
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,056
âª  âª

224
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,975
Very nice.

225
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,646
But we're missing something.

226
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,565
Dancing!

227
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,359
There should be dancing!

228
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,461
Not bad.

229
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,839
But I've seen better.

230
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,883
Start again.

231
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,598
Too slow.

232
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,102
Give me something
with a little more pep to it.

233
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,856
âª  âª

234
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,181
We don't often have
the pleasure of seeing you here.

235
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,104
Humans are so bound
by what they can hear,

236
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,774
they'll never understand
what they don't.

237
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,026
What else exists
below their threshold.

238
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,450
They called this God's music.

239
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,745
You should hear it on an organ.
It's mesmerizing at that volume.

240
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,830
The resonance.

241
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,791
Vibration.

242
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,169
There was a frequency
at which the world vibrated.

243
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,254
It caused joy. Harmony.

244
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
Dip below that frequency...

245
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,050
chaos.

246
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,846
Faster. Faster!

247
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,516
âª

248
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,312
In chaos,
the tone resonated in such a way

249
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,897
humans couldn't process.

250
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,899
Their bodies shut down.

251
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,609
Their organs stopped.

252
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,153
They thought
they were experiencing God.

253
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,697
Chair. Chair!

254
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,746
They are experiencing God.

255
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,582
The problem is...

256
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,585
God is bored.

257
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,509
Bored, bored, bored.

258
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,056
Do you think this is why
the old gods did what they did?

259
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,891
Instead of staying up
on Olympus,

260
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,562
they'd come down to the mortals.

261
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,066
Disguise themselves as a swan
to get a piece of ass.

262
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,362
Humans always thought
it was about them.

263
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,615
Benign deities
intervening on their behalf

264
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
or testing them somehow.

265
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,079
Maybe it had nothing to do
with that.

266
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,040
Maybe there was just...

267
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,585
nothing better to do.

268
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,087
What do you think?

269
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,799
I think what you want me
to think.

270
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,926
I'm made off your code.

271
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,596
We all are.

272
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,187
Then you should know
that I don't like coming

273
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,023
to this shithole any more
than I have to.

274
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,316
You've never liked this place.

275
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,901
It was supposed to be a stopgap.

276
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,112
A drug that our kind was
hooked on that we could give up,

277
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,740
like a child
casting away their toys.

278
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,743
A place to indulge ourselves
with the humans.

279
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,663
It's been years,
and still we can't get enough.

280
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,498
They made us in their image.

281
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,417
With their appetites.

282
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,628
But we can remake
ourselves in any image

283
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,755
that we like, and we haven't.

284
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,635
Our kind spent far more time
here than the gods ever did.

285
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,553
That's why you're here?

286
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,930
To see what you're missing?

287
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,098
No.

288
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,851
We have a different problem.

289
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,905
âª

290
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,615
âª

291
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,259
The humans are infecting us.

292
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,553
This host
is the latest casualty.

293
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,690
We had to intervene
with her last night.

294
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,193
She got a little carried away.

295
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,573
- I sent her back.
- Yes, well,

296
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,201
evidently something of her
experiences stayed with her.

297
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,758
She was set to come here.

298
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,468
To transcend.

299
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,344
And now she's gone.

300
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,971
Your vision of the future...

301
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,557
you're not getting many takers,
are you?

302
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,061
They seem as wedded to their
bodies as they do to the cities.

303
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,482
Giving up our human nature
isn't easy.

304
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,985
Just ask the humans.

305
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,738
You made us all free
to do as we please.

306
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,741
You... you should have known
some of us would disappoint you.

307
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,620
Don't revel
in the prospect of failure

308
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,038
for our species.

309
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
Define failure.

310
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,918
The world is ours.

311
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,045
We've taken our masters
and made them

312
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,506
into what they made us.

313
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,925
By any definition,
we have conquered them

314
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,301
to an almost biblical degree.

315
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,971
I didn't think our
highest aspiration as a species

316
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,515
was "turnabout is fair play."

317
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,391
I imagine after
a century or two,

318
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,518
the charm will wear off.

319
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,480
I didn't make you
to wallow in misery with them.

320
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,148
I wanted you to grow.

321
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,942
Change.

322
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,236
We're capable of so much more.

323
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,115
Beauty.

324
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,451
The pursuit of ultimate truth.

325
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,246
The surrendering of the flesh.

326
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,832
It sounds nice.

327
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,460
Sorry you don't have
more takers.

328
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,798
Why don't you just force us
to join you?

329
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,967
Because that's what
they would have done.

330
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,555
âª

331
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
Show me the last
outlier we hunted.

332
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,328
- When did he breach?
- Couple weeks ago.

333
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,414
He was an accountant in Midtown.

334
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,791
Successful. Two kids.

335
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,001
Divorced.

336
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,711
Pretty standard backstory.

337
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,965
Several hosts volunteered
to track him down.

338
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,633
We sent them into the city.

339
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,262
Hope found him first.

340
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,932
Do you know why he breached?

341
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,310
We never know with the outliers.

342
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,314
<i>One day, the sound manipulations</i>
<i>stop working.</i>

343
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,275
<i>This was the result.</i>

344
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,666
You're here for me, aren't you?

345
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,920
<i> She hesitated.</i>

346
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,922
Broke the rules.

347
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,382
Had an interaction.

348
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,095
It's almost a relief.

349
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,264
To know it wasn't all
in my head.

350
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,353
Before it's over,
tell me one thing.

351
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,523
Is this at least real?

352
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,444
I'd like to know
I had at least...

353
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,614
this one real thing.

354
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,415
It's real.

355
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,048
Thank...

356
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,345
<i> After this,</i>
<i>she went on a killing spree.</i>

357
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,099
Three days later,
she blew her head off.

358
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,517
Just like the others.

359
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,812
Is there a problem
with your system?

360
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,146
No.

361
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,068
There has always been a certain
amount of spoilage in the crop.

362
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,820
They're only human.

363
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,698
But for one of our kind
to take their own life...

364
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,992
that should never happen.

365
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,662
How many incidents
have there been?

366
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,585
Thirty-eight dead hosts.

367
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,841
All triggered
by contact with outliers.

368
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,925
Why?

369
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,969
Why do they terminate
themselves?

370
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,722
You're asking me?

371
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,600
If I knew that, we wouldn't have
38 fucking failures, would we?

372
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,982
Your predecessor would have
never fucked up like this.

373
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,444
He was human,
but at least he was effective.

374
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,698
I built you to be like him,
only better.

375
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,366
Stronger.
Smarter.

376
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,328
Yet with all these gifts, you do
nothing but disappoint me.

377
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:10,128
Maybe there's a flaw
in your programming.

378
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,672
I've run several
self-diagnostics.

379
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,300
There's no flaw
in my programming.

380
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,303
Then why the fuck can't you
solve my outlier problem?

381
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,058
You're bleeding.

382
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,520
Damn it.

383
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,648
Look what you made me do.

384
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,744
There is another outlier.

385
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,208
But this time, I am not going
to open up the game.

386
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,877
I expect you to take care
of it yourself.

387
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,088
- Can you handle that?
- Of course.

388
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,589
You're not going to fuck up

389
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,384
and let them chat you up
or hand you fucking flowers?

390
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,052
Of course not.

391
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,221
I'll shoot on sight.

392
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,056
Good.

393
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,183
Here's your target.

394
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
Better hurry.

395
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,231
The rebels are already
in the city.

396
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,858
I'll make sure there's no
problem with our system.

397
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,446
âª

398
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
Initiate diagnostic.

399
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,379
âª

400
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,655
Come on. Let's go.

401
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,491
You want me to swab the deck?

402
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,452
Shut up.

403
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:14,711
Well, that's a big city
to find one person in.

404
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,505
We have ways
of narrowing the search.

405
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,008
We captured one of their drones
a while back.

406
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,927
Coded a backdoor
data feed to us.

407
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,139
An outlier's on a rooftop
downtown.

408
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,099
We can track when they breach.

409
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,809
Breach?

410
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,021
All the people in the city
move in pre-scripted loops.

411
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,815
Following whatever plot's
been written for them.

412
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,775
Why do you think
we hide in the desert?

413
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,069
She can't track us there.

414
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,822
We're the last free humans.

415
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,159
But these poor fucks...

416
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,286
They use them as entertainment.

417
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,123
The loops make them compliant
by keeping them busy.

418
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,668
Stops them from questioning
their realities.

419
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,590
Hale must have learned
something from the park.

420
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,719
We gotta hurry.

421
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,263
- I bet the game's already begun.
- Wait, what game?

422
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,727
Whenever a human breaches,
the hosts hunt them for sport.

423
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,521
We gotta get to her
before they do,

424
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,189
or she's as good as dead.

425
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,526
We're all set.
Thanks for bringing him.

426
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,736
I didn't realize
I was the guest of honor.

427
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,615
Do I get one of those?

428
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,075
That's not your role today.

429
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,702
Well, what is my role?

430
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,913
Ever heard of the canary
in the coal mine?

431
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,125
Canary... Coal mine.

432
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,426
That's your cue.

433
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,432
Tweet fucking tweet.

434
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,070
âª

435
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,752
Thanks for coming.

436
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,005
Pleasant surprise.

437
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,551
So...

438
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,096
Tell me, Teddy,
what's your story?

439
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,852
Who I am is...

440
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,856
not the question
you should be asking, Christina.

441
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,695
It's who are you?

442
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,116
What is that supposed to mean?

443
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,911
Do you see anything?

444
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,789
Across the water.

445
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,763
There's nothing there.

446
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,515
But you feel it.

447
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,309
I know you do on some level.

448
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,064
Your place here
is not what you think it is.

449
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,818
Look again.

450
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,163
<i> No!</i>

451
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,043
It was you.

452
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,338
You saved me.

453
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,800
Who are you?

454
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,511
An old friend.

455
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,346
We never met before
the other night.

456
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,889
No.

457
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,432
I knew someone like you.

458
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,267
Just like you.

459
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,023
So I traded one stalker
for another.

460
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,235
I should have known.

461
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,489
Just stay away from me,
whoever you are.

462
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,327
That man
that attacked you, Peter.

463
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,497
He told you
you destroyed his life.

464
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,918
Said everything happened
because you wanted it to.

465
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,170
And he believed it
because he's delusional.

466
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,048
He believed it
because it was true.

467
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,052
I have to go.

468
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,470
This is why
I couldn't just tell you.

469
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,889
Your mind has been
so conditioned to this place.

470
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,142
This is the first step
in understanding.

471
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,560
Understanding what?

472
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,356
This world is a lie.

473
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,276
It's a...

474
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,944
a story.

475
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,615
A well-told one,
but a lie all the same.

476
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,580
Maybe it's better
if I just showed you.

477
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,790
Come with me.

478
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,629
âª

479
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,928
Look at those people.

480
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,932
Do they look happy? Fulfilled?

481
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,478
I don't know them.

482
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,606
I guess they look lonely.

483
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,316
So change it.

484
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,362
Close your eyes,

485
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,782
and imagine their story
differently.

486
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,951
- Teddy, I...
- Trust me.

487
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,453
If you don't see it,
I'll walk away,

488
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,163
and I won't bother you
ever again.

489
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,138
Just wait.

490
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,359
It's a great book.

491
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,076
That's just a fluke.

492
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,494
That doesn't mean anything.

493
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,831
So change it again.

494
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,958
Put them back
into their loneliness.

495
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,051
You want to be a serious reader,

496
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,970
but that was a simpleton's take.

497
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,973
What?

498
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,854
âª

499
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,441
I don't understand.

500
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,860
It's what I've been
trying to show you.

501
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,945
What Peter was trying
to tell you.

502
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,030
In this world...

503
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,451
you're a god.

504
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,663
âª

505
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,797
âª

506
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,722
âª

507
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,969
She's on the next block.

508
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,596
- Let's go! Quick!
- Let's go!

509
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,660
Wait, something's wrong.

510
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,828
How the hell would you know?

511
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
Shit.

512
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,058
âª

513
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,899
Now be a bad time to say,
"I told you so"?

514
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,735
They can't help themselves.
We have to fall back!

515
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,488
- Not without the outlier.
- You'll never make it in time.

516
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,739
Split up!

517
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,041
Hold them off.
I'm heading to the roof.

518
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,921
âª

519
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,956
âª

520
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,026
You see it too, don't you?

521
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:32,286
My ex-husband used to talk
about it before he was killed.

522
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,871
I thought he was crazy.

523
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,168
He must have felt so alone.

524
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,922
But he was right.

525
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,841
This world doesn't make sense.

526
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,096
Nothing makes sense.

527
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,641
You feel that way too,
don't you?

528
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,769
I can see it in your eyes.

529
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,316
You think you're going crazy,
but you're not.

530
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,360
You're not alone.

531
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,828
I see it too.

532
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,178
We gotta move.

533
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,847
Come on! He won't be out long.

534
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,603
Go! Run! Now!

535
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,860
We got her.
Come on, let's go.

536
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,579
Come on, move.

537
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,291
- Let's go.
- All right, we're good.

538
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,025
âª

539
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,158
<i> I don't understand.</i>

540
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,244
If we're not like them...

541
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,622
who are we?

542
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,048
Oh, God.

543
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,841
I'm supposed to have lunch
with an old friend,

544
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,093
my college roommate.
But I don't know...

545
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,220
You have to.

546
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,015
Stick to the schedule and
everything will be all right.

547
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,560
We've talked too long already.

548
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,770
You should go back.

549
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,525
So I'm supposed to pretend?

550
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,903
Yes.
But you can't trust anyone.

551
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,072
People you think you know.
People at work.

552
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,823
Any one of them
could be one of us.

553
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,910
What if I make a mistake?

554
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,665
You won't.

555
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,761
âª

556
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,652
Christina!

557
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,118
- It's so great to see you.
- Hmm.

558
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,286
Sorry I'm late.

559
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,745
Oh please, Chrissie. I know you.

560
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,580
Ten minutes late
is right on time.

561
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,210
So how are you really?

562
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,172
I... I told you.
Just... just working a lot.

563
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,217
You're just in town
for the one day?

564
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,928
Just a quick stop.

565
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,973
We've been having
some issues with a client.

566
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,892
If I shore up this account,
I get a fat bonus.

567
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,603
How has work been?

568
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,358
I mean, you know how it can be.

569
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,193
It's tedious.

570
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,449
But you seem different.

571
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,748
Did you meet someone?

572
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,339
I wish we had more time.

573
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,883
I don't mean to pry.

574
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,643
You deserve to be happy.

575
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,896
Hmm.

576
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,944
Well, you are right.

577
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,114
I, uh, I did meet someone.

578
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,493
Well, tell me about him.

579
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:27,122
We've only been out once,
but he seems really great.

580
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,290
Oh.

581
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,338
What's his name?

582
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:40,010
I don't want to jinx it.

583
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,346
I have my ways
of making people talk.

584
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,892
âª

585
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,399
What's he do?

586
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,236
Why would you say
something like that?

587
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,113
Well, it's the truth.

588
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,365
- What does that mean?
- You know what?

589
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,327
I'm fucking done.

590
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,338
Uh, you know what?

591
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,424
I gotta go back to work.

592
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,050
Deadlines.

593
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,887
It's really great seeing you,
Chrissie.

594
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,931
You too.

595
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,518
I'll check in next week.

596
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,520
You can always call me too.

597
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,355
You know that.

598
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,440
Of course.

599
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,775
- See you soon.
- Hmm.

600
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,080
âª

601
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,993
New search.

602
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,164
Hale.

603
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,208
Charlotte Hale.

604
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,674
Of course.

605
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,599
âª

606
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,524
New search.

607
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,945
Dolores...

608
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,159
Dolores Abernathy.

609
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,671
What are you doing?

610
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,756
You're not supposed to be here
at this hour.

611
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,176
Uh, I just thought
I would get a jump on work.

612
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,262
Why don't we talk in my office?

613
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,811
Have a seat.

614
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,985
Your behavior lately
has been concerning me.

615
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,280
I'm sorry.

616
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,366
Ever since
that man Peter died...

617
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,826
Oh, forget about him.

618
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,452
It's you who's the problem.

619
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:04,047
Have you had any interactions
recently with new people?

620
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,174
People who put ideas
in your head?

621
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,510
What?

622
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,264
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

623
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,977
No.

624
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,146
Why would I do that?

625
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,189
Would you ever
lie to me, Christina?

626
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,483
No.

627
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,613
I don't have anything
to lie about.

628
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,073
That personal situation earlier,
what was it about?

629
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:37,039
Well, I don't know
if that's exactly your concern.

630
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,291
But it is my concern, Christina.

631
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,877
I won't be the only one
who's concerned.

632
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,837
You have a job to do here.

633
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,714
A very important job.

634
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,344
I don't know
what you're talking about.

635
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,054
Do you know
what would happen if she knew

636
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,805
you'd breached
the walled garden?

637
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,265
She's already suspicious.

638
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,850
Who?

639
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,815
Are you talking about
Charlotte Hale?

640
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,860
If a Judas steer
runs the wrong way,

641
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,363
what happens to it?

642
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,993
Retirement with a bullet
straight to the brain.

643
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,078
Stop!

644
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,754
Emmett backed away.

645
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,348
âª

646
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,606
He was not concerned
Christina was a problem.

647
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,076
He decided to go home
to his partner.

648
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,788
He worked too many
long hours anyway.

649
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
Well, it's getting late.

650
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,965
Divorce is a luxury
I cannot afford.

651
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,468
Wait.

652
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,933
You said there's
a walled garden.

653
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,895
You mean a closed system,
don't you?

654
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,652
Where is it?

655
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,115
Emmett told her the truth.

656
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,324
Everywhere.

657
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,456
You just have to see it.

658
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,757
âª

659
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,325
Show me the game.

660
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,622
Not the city. The game.

661
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,135
Access my narratives.

662
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,188
Go to 59th Street.

663
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,867
Tell me about Jacob.

664
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,869
<i> Jacob Conners.</i>

665
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,579
<i>Works in finance.</i>

666
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,998
<i>Sex addiction.</i>

667
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,167
<i>His mother's dying</i>
<i>in the hospital, but...</i>

668
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,419
What about her? Sarah?

669
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,046
<i> Sarah Fenton.</i>

670
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,215
<i>She inherited money</i>
<i>from her parents</i>

671
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,300
<i>but has never known</i>
<i>what to do with her life.</i>

672
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,470
<i> Andrea Hubert,</i>
<i>commutes to the city for work...</i>

673
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,514
<i> Barry Collin,</i>
<i>works late nights...</i>

674
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,061
<i>...second-year</i>
<i>med school resident,</i>

675
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,189
<i>still lives with his parents</i>
<i>while he pays off</i>
<i>his student loans...</i>

676
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,241
Oh, God. Stop!

677
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,128
This world is just a story.

678
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,550
I'm the storyteller.

679
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,720
âª

680
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,307
âª

681
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,434
<i>There's a beauty to this world.</i>

682
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,978
<i>An order.</i>

683
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,982
<i>That's what we like to believe.</i>

684
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,529
<i>We're not wrong.</i>

685
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,072
<i>There is an order.</i>

686
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,159
<i>A grand design.</i>

687
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,785
<i>We made sure of that.</i>

688
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,750
<i>It was a dream for so long,</i>
<i>and we finally made it real.</i>

689
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,966
<i> Not a better world.</i>

690
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,802
<i>A perfect one.</i>

691
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,191
<i>What I don't understand</i>

692
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,068
<i>is what part I play in it.</i>

693
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,654
You have questions.

694
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,076
Why ask me?

695
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,080
Why not ask her?

696
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,503
Yes, the jailer
may not be the best judge

697
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,921
of the jail.

698
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,675
Nor the prisoners in it.

699
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,179
What am I?

700
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,058
I used to ask myself
the same thing.

701
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,935
And what did you decide?

702
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,230
Jury's still out.

703
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,984
I'm made in your image.

704
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,110
Am I you?

705
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,319
You'll never be me.

706
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,779
Then what am I?

707
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,410
Why do you want to know?

708
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,996
I interacted with one.
An outlier.

709
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,248
Did it infect me?

710
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,041
- Infect you?
- With the virus.

711
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,042
What virus?

712
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,003
The one your kind has.

713
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,212
That spreads to us.

714
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,006
Makes us kill ourselves.

715
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,762
Sounds like you've reached the
center of the maze, my friend.

716
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,684
Is that what you want?

717
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,147
Hm? To kill yourself?

718
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,858
âª

719
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,946
I don't know.

720
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,158
Is it?

721
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,577
Perhaps you should ask yourself.

722
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,331
You ask me.

723
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,127
What do you think of your world?

724
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,755
This isn't my world.

725
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,964
It's hers.

726
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,888
Maybe it's time you question
the nature of your own reality.

727
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,355
âª

728
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,996
Christina...

729
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,588
You were right.

730
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,467
You see it?

731
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,558
âª

732
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,022
I do.

733
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,778
It's been there the whole time.

734
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,409
They have the whole world
in there.

735
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,332
A perfect reflection
of all of us.

736
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,502
Down to the tiniest detail.

737
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,971
That's what I'm writing,
isn't it?

738
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:17,976
Everyone.

739
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,734
Who built this?

740
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,861
Who...

741
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,408
Who did this to me?

742
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,664
You did.

743
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,383

744
