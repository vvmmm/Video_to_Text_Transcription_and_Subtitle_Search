FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,447
Iâ¦

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,084
made a mistake.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,961
So you ran into Jong-pal
by coincidence yesterday

6
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,884
and made a mistake?

7
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,763
Does this "mistake" mean

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
what adults do?

9
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,429
What are you thinking?
Me and Jong-pal? A mistake?

10
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,972
"I met Jong-min yesterday."
"I made a mistake."

11
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,597
That's what you said earlier.

12
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,733
No, I said I ran into Jong-pal
by coincidence yesterday

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,692
to explain my emotional state.

14
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,403
And what's that state?

15
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,526
Yesterday was Jong-pal's
wedding anniversary.

16
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,574
I guess that date got stuck in my head.

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,953
I hate myself for waking up
and remembering that date.

18
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,116
It's been five years

19
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,705
and what have I been doing in that time?

20
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,495
It was very complicated.

21
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,415
The intro is too long.

22
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,924
There's a time in your life
when a coincidence is really powerful.

23
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,547
You know, the moments
when you run into someone

24
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,135
by coincidence wherever you go.

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,305
That's how I am these days.

26
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,061
You, too.

27
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,265
Why did I have to run into him
on his wedding anniversary?

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,399
Speed it up.

29
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,652
Give me Chan-hyuk's number.

30
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,152
Ms. Kim.

31
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,708
We can't get started
because you're not coming.

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,079
Let's go.

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,424
Okay.

34
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,882
Who is he?

35
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,512
The Vice CEO from the US headquarters.
We had a welcoming party yesterday.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,470
So?

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,260
I couldn't get myself together
before the meal

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,470
because I ran into Jong-pal.

39
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,096
You were just looking
for a reason to drink.

40
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,023
Right.

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,602
I found a reason to drink

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,478
and I drank a lot.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,530
Andâ¦

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,029
I made a mistake with the new Vice CEO.

45
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,085
Mom.

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,129
You're here.

47
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,241
Hello?

48
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,913
Jin-sook.

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,991
It's me, Man-ho.

50
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,950
Are you at Gangseo Police Station?

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,867
Yes.

52
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,366
What in the world is going on?

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,340
After I talked to you on the phone,

54
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,299
I brought someone from a group chat.

55
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,142
She was the member
who was with Sang-sik until the very end.

56
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,444
Where is it at?

57
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,330
{\an8}I live in Suwon

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,793
{\an8}and Oppa was on his way there anyway,
so he offered me a ride and I hopped on.

59
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,052
{\an8}I had dinner with Oppa at the rest stop

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,720
{\an8}and I took the back road home.

61
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,394
{\an8}Since when has Oppa been out of reach?

62
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,896
You should go to the hospital.

63
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,281
Okay.

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,242
Go.

65
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,492
Oh.

66
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,783
You're the doctor son-in-law.

67
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,159
I heard a lot about you from Oppa.

68
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,169
Gosh.

69
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,261
That word "oppa" is stuck to your mouth.

70
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,474
She calls me oppa, too.

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,680
Did you part ways
after just having dinner?

72
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:23,106
Unnie, Oppa has been having a hard time
because of that graduation from marriage.

73
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:31,214
Why are you bringing that up
at this moment?

74
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,839
Did youâ¦

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,960
talk about graduation
from marriage with Oppa?

76
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,048
No, Jin-sook.
Everyone in the club heard about it.

77
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,564
And this graduation from marriage
is kind of your fault.

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,270
Our club can't live without
your signature kimchi.

79
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,568
Did my father say anything
about going somewhere else?

80
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,532
I don't know about that.

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:16,214
Should I say this or not?

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,510
Unnie, we need to talk alone.

83
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,473
Why are you trying to make things weird?

84
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,595
You have nothing to talk about
with Jin-sook alone.

85
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,851
You know,

86
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,191
one thing I'm sure about Sang-sik
is that he's very gentle.

87
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:43,242
He never did anything
to make women misunderstand.

88
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,359
You don't know anything, Oppa.

89
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,449
There are things
that the children shouldn't hear.

90
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,245
Let me get this straight.

91
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,753
Because you ran into Jong-pal yesterday,
your emotions got complicated,

92
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,547
so you drank, got drunk,

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,300
and slept with the Vice CEO?

94
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,258
I couldn't tell anyone else.

95
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,718
So you needed a trash can.

96
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,805
A trash can?

97
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,641
It was too much to handle alone,

98
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,226
so you wanted to tell someone
about it and empty it out.

99
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,107
Right.

100
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,781
Deal.

101
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,145
I'll be the trash can for you.

102
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,657
So tell me what happened.

103
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,489
Everything.

104
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,372
I'm sure it seemed weird
between me and Jong-pal.

105
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,378
But I liked it because he didn't ask me

106
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,591
about who he is
and what our relationship is.

107
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,219
I'm Im Geon-joo.

108
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,219
Pleased to meet you.

109
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,890
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

110
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,176
You're wonderful.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,150
Paper books never disappear.

112
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,034
Be super positive!

113
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,321
-Be positive!
-Be super positive!

114
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,536
Are you serious?

115
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,660
You'll be 40 soon,

116
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,956
and you still say yes to everything
when you get drunk?

117
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,831
I couldn't help myself feeling good.

118
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,168
So, he saw you feeling good,

119
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,134
he smiled at you, and your heart raced.

120
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,057
Gosh, you're still young.

121
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,773
-Oh, friends forever
-Oh, friends forever

122
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,613
-Oh, a happy heart
-Oh, a happy heart

123
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,989
-Oh, a happy life
-Oh, a happy life

124
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,236
-Oh, friends forever
-Oh, friends forever

125
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,698
-Oh, a happy heart
-Oh, a happy heart

126
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,544
The time we spent not seeing each other
must've been longer than we thought.

127
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,836
The Eun-hee I knewâ¦

128
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,919
I would've avoided it.

129
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,093
Saying that he's obviously making a move.

130
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,085
But the me in the present liked it.
It's not complicated.

131
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,676
"He's showing that he likes me."

132
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,893
"He wants to impress me."

133
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,652
I feel like I'm watching
an animal documentary about seduction.

134
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,306
Seduction.

135
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,108
What's the next episode about?

136
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,651
What are we drinking at the music bar?

137
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,654
What?

138
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,695
Makgeolli?

139
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,368
It's super delicious.

140
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,330
But it's a bit expensive.

141
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,538
-Let's go.
-I was

142
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,964
jealous in that short moment.

143
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,707
Actually, it's not exactly jealousy.

144
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,756
Anyway,

145
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,757
I felt all kinds of emotions
at that moment.

146
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,012
That's the power of alcohol.

147
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,771
I'm getting bored now. Speed it up a bit.

148
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,940
Hey, this kind of story
is all about details.

149
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:09,527
My dad prioritized me
more than his business.

150
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:15,738
In Africa, he made me
a special space of my ownâ¦

151
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,123
My father is a truck driver!

152
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,751
Do you think this is fun?

153
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,209
Is it fun to talk about your father's job
when we're all grown-ups?

154
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,129
When you're at a music bar,

155
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,383
listen to the music.

156
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,678
I'll shut my mouth, okay?

157
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,506
You're drunk.

158
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,234
I have about 5 trillion
and 50 song requests to make.

159
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,937
You go home first.

160
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,647
Okay.

161
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,361
I'm leaving first, Eun-hee.

162
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,571
You eat everything you want to eat.

163
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,913
And charge me for it, okay?

164
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,909
I willâ¦

165
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,697
Eat whatever you want.

166
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,325
-Go!
-Okay?

167
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,790
I'm not going
until I listen to everything.

168
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:14,972
Go on, shoo, shoo

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,560
Beyond the mountains

170
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,850
Finally on the 1982 Campus Song Festival.

171
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,814
Where's Kyung-ok?

172
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,017
I sent her home by taxi.

173
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,187
She wasn't that drunk.

174
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,694
I'm out of breath
from running back in case you left.

175
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,249
You've only been requesting songs
from the Campus Song Festival.

176
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,460
How did you knowâ¦

177
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,344
that this song was from
the University Song Festival?

178
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,246
Isnât it that song?

179
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,971
You requested songs
starting from the first festival, right?

180
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,509
You know all of them?

181
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,505
My father loves them.

182
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,024
"My father is a truck driver!"

183
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,521
That father, right?

184
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,608
You're a good daughter.

185
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,189
You must be close to your father.

186
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,105
Both are incorrect.

187
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,699
My father only loves my older sister.

188
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,280
But he always comes to me
when he has a favor to ask.

189
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,164
"Record Campus Song Festival songs for me
so I can listen to them while driving."

190
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,206
"Sort out the Grand Prize-winning songs."

191
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,250
"Record the songs I like."

192
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,541
And eventually,

193
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,881
I mastered
Campus Song Festival songs, too.

194
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,554
How can he not love such a cute daughter?

195
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,973
I tend to sober up

196
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,976
when I hear cheesy expressions.

197
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,936
Then I'm going to
continue saying cheesy things.

198
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,819
You're really drunk,
so you need to sober up.

199
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,681
Wellâ¦

200
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,808
These things happen.

201
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,444
There, are you done?

202
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,533
The trash can has been emptied out,

203
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,778
so forget about it now.

204
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,323
Yes.

205
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,987
But you must be worried.

206
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,213
"What if I run into him
at work on Monday?"

207
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,288
Exactly.

208
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,503
"Should I just quit over the weekend?"

209
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,171
"Should I be cool and ignore him?"

210
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,205
"No, what if he spreads words everywhere?"

211
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,628
You're having fun.

212
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,625
"What if he doesn't even remember it?"

213
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,757
-Stop it.
-Anyway,

214
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,304
don't come up with stories.

215
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,348
Just forget about it.

216
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,521
If it spreads, so what?

217
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,729
Just be embarrassed.

218
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,309
Time goes on.

219
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,944
If something bigger happens,

220
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,360
it'll be forgotten soon.

221
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,907
It's not a mistake.

222
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,042
You don't want to forget it, do you?

223
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,030
My dream library was there.

224
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,365
I thought it was my bookshelf.

225
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,248
We had so many of the same books.

226
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,222
Don't try to sneak away quietly.

227
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,684
Drink all of this tea.

228
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,475
Okay.

229
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,898
We communicatedâ¦

230
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,229
so well.

231
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,819
I haven't had a fling
for the past five years.

232
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,288
That's the saddest story
I've heard recently.

233
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,869
There's no need to be sad.
I wasn't even lonely.

234
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,332
"I must be sick of boring relationships."

235
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,165
"I must hate men."
"I must be a master of having fun alone."

236
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,632
I was certain of it.

237
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,219
But,

238
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,641
how could all of that collapse overnight?

239
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,178
That's the most heartwarming story
I've heard recently.

240
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,812
-Congratulations.
-For what?

241
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,639
You can talk to him well,
he has the books you have,

242
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,305
and has a similar soul as you.

243
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,439
To put it simply,

244
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,521
you fell in love.

245
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,028
Would it be okay for Mom to be alone?

246
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,624
I thought that woman was so vulgar,

247
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,287
but she thinks that some stories
shouldn't be heard by the children.

248
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,125
She's a decent person.

249
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,838
Unnie.

250
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,425
There really was
a medicine bottle in Oppa's truck.

251
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,512
Come on.

252
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,846
Don't say such unnecessary things.

253
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,233
How is this an unnecessary thing?

254
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,310
Unnie looks clueless.

255
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,780
You're family but looks like
you know nothing.

256
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,645
What medicine bottle?

257
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,276
He collected sleeping pills in it.

258
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,870
Come on.

259
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,165
He's been saying
that he'll go to the mountains,

260
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,789
take a bottle full of sleeping pills,
and fall asleep to his death.

261
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,133
Oppa, you've heard him saying that
once or twice, right?

262
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,006
Well, Sang-sikâ¦

263
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,795
is so gentle and romantic,

264
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,807
so he was popular among women.

265
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,519
So I thought he was pretending

266
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,604
to be lonely and sad in front of women.

267
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,859
I didn't know it was real.

268
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,124
Yes, Driver Choi.

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,830
Did you look into Sang-sik's truck?

270
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,711
Someone called and said

271
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,883
his truck was parked all night long
and something was weird.

272
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,512
So I called them

273
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,466
and told them to open the door,

274
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,553
and the door was unlocked.

275
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,515
He also left his car key,
cell phone, and wallet

276
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,968
next to the driver's seat.

277
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,018
Oh, my.

278
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,692
Rightâ¦

279
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,614
Tell them to check
if there's a medicine bottle.

280
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,856
I don't see a medicine bottle.

281
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,156
Check the cargo, too. Search thoroughly.

282
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,620
Let's go. They found your father's truck.

283
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
There's a problem.

284
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,460
I had no interest
in relationships for five years

285
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,878
and he managed to seduce me overnight.

286
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,255
He could be a playboy.

287
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,143
Well, I can't do anything about that.

288
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,764
Yes, you can.

289
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,427
I need to learn the mind of a playboy.

290
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,017
-You're a playboy, too.
-Did you just say, "too?"

291
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,109
Rightâ¦

292
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,900
Well thenâ¦

293
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,485
what is a playboy?

294
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,740
Good.

295
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,071
This is the chance
to learn about the concept.

296
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,527
The concept is not important.

297
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,536
It's very important.

298
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,369
When others, and by that I mean
those around you, say things like

299
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,166
"He's admirable."

300
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,670
"That person is a liar."

301
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,251
"That person is lazy."

302
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,923
Then they really are.

303
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,965
If they say "That person is a player."

304
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,678
then they're a player.

305
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,259
Everyone said that you're a playboy
since you were in school.

306
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,256
You knew that as well.

307
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,893
I must learn about playboys.

308
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,557
I need someone who's
a total playboy from head to toe.

309
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,154
-That's you.
-My goodness.

310
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,951
Ji-woo, youâ¦

311
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,532
I told you not to tell people
where the office is.

312
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,293
Your sister?

313
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,460
She's right here. Why?

314
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,461
Where's your phone?

315
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,713
Phone?

316
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,712
Maybe it's in the car.

317
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,257
She left it in the car.
Do you want me to put her on?

318
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,434
He doesn't sound very good.

319
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,891
Yes, why?

320
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,727
I'm taking off now.

321
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,242
What is it?

322
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,402
I don't know. Dad's out of reach.

323
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,491
Where did I put my car key?

324
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,869
Heyâ¦

325
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,984
Hello.

326
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,817
Oh, hello.

327
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,784
You should greet me too.

328
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,782
Why are you here? It's a holiday today.

329
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,574
To practice editing.

330
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,288
Then practice it.

331
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,297
Yes, this is the rest area
for the truck drivers

332
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,006
behind the Chilbo Driver Rest Stop.

333
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,523
Is this the police station
with jurisdiction?

334
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,848
That's the only mountain you can go to

335
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,194
with your car parked here.

336
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,479
Why would anyone go there at night?

337
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,613
Though it looks low,

338
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,569
it's called Panting Mountain,
because it's full of stiff hills.

339
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,030
Yes, my father's truck is here,

340
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,451
so we want to file
another missing person's report.

341
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,197
Yes, okay.

342
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,785
They said to come to the station.

343
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,460
They can check the CCTV nearby.

344
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,418
Let's go, Mom.

345
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,998
-Thank you.
-Okay.

346
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,838
He got out of the truck,

347
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,222
sat there for about an hour,

348
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,049
and went to the mountain.

349
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,844
We can't see him on video after that,

350
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,678
perhaps because he didn't take
the hiking route.

351
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,085
He's been identified.

352
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,801
Name, Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

353
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,594
June 24th, 1963.

354
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,894
Is there a patient named
Mr. Kim Sang-sik, born in 1963?

355
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,725
Hang on.

356
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,181
Ms. Jin-sook?

357
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,534
Right?

358
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,532
You're Jin-sook, right?

359
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,238
-Dad!
-Dad!

360
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,491
-Dad, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

361
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,258
-Is it Ji-woo?
-Yes.

362
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,967
They found your father
right after he was reported missing.

363
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,728
He's at the hospital now.

364
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,729
He's fine. It's Suwon Hospital 3.
I'll type in the new address.

365
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,612
Nari, navigate me to Suwon Hospital 3!

366
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,280
Navigating to Suwon Hospital 3.

367
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,363
Jeez, is your navigation hearing impaired?

368
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,737
Do you have to yell like that?

369
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,374
If I say it quietly,
it takes me to the wrong place.

370
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,289
Even machines only listen to
those with loud voices.

371
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,249
Hey, aren't you speeding up
out of joy right now?

372
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,802
You took my car key in such a cool way,

373
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,591
so I thought you got a driver's license.

374
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,220
Never drive a car.

375
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,555
That's your life philosophy.

376
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,270
You remember. You keep it in mind, too.

377
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,141
Never drive in a state like this.

378
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,268
You had the car key in your hand
and you kept looking for it.

379
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,856
How can you drive in a such state?
Just take a taxi.

380
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,192
I'll drive safely, you coward.

381
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,411
Are you okay now?

382
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,235
What?

383
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,454
Drop me off at a nearby subway station.

384
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,365
Right, of course.

385
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,213
I didn't realize we came
all the way to Suwon.

386
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,878
What if Seo-young got the wrong idea?

387
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,052
I was out of it earlier,
so I couldn't even say hi properly.

388
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,722
It looked like she brought lunch boxes.

389
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,550
You managed to see that
while you were out of it?

390
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,426
A lunch box on a day off
is the proof of an office romance.

391
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,928
I won't tell Ji-woo.

392
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,269
Even after five years, you're still nosy.

393
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,063
-Bye.
-Bye.

394
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,904
Thanks.

395
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,119
You have to fast until the checkups
are done, so we gave you IV fluids.

396
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,745
Okay.

397
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,255
Dad?

398
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,513
I'm a Dad?

399
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,101
When he arrived at the hospital,
he showed the symptoms of hypothermia.

400
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,693
He showed signs of frostbite
on his fingers and toes,

401
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,059
but he recovered quickly.

402
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,685
How is he right now?

403
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,436
We have to do checkups
to see if there's any organ damage.

404
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,651
By the wayâ¦

405
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,156
-It's okay.
-Sir, calm down.

406
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,449
Please calm down.

407
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,292
Sir, what's your name?

408
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,793
I'm Kim Sang-sik.

409
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,503
How old are you?

410
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,344
Me?

411
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,803
You mean my age?

412
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
Yes, your age, Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

413
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,385
I am

414
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,682
22 years old.

415
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,021
What?

416
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,852
I'm 22 this year
and I will be a father next year.

417
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,271
I don't know why I'm at a hospital.

418
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,073
My body and face are so weird right now.

419
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,530
Sir, do you know what the date is today?

420
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,905
October 13th.

421
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,834
Do you know what year it is?

422
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,923
It's 19â¦

423
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,884
It's 1982.

424
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,247
-Did you say 1982?
-Did you say 1982?

425
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,933
Yes, that day in 1982
is Mr. Kim Sang-sik's last memory.

426
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,802
I'm sure he's the most
confused person right now,

427
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,136
so don't ask questions
and treat him naturally.

428
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,522
There can be a mix-up
in memories due to shock,

429
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,690
but he'll recover soon.

430
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,057
Ms. Sook.

431
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,570
Mom.

432
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,615
Dad!

433
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,997
Dad, are you okay?

434
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,215
By the way,

435
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,102
if Dad is 22 now,

436
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,603
isn't he younger than me?

437
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,023
By the way,

438
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,607
what day is October 13th, 1982?

439
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,863
It sounds so familiar.
Is it someone's birthday?

440
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,865
It's written on the photo
in the living room.

441
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,948
You always see it,
but you still don't know?

442
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,914
Right. That's crazy.

443
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,001
Thank you.

444
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,300
If you're hungry,

445
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,717
we should go eat
rather than drink milk here.

446
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,988
Why are you smiling?

447
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,075
Becauseâ¦

448
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,082
you look so beautiful today.

449
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,957
Even more than usual.

450
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,674
I'm sorry.

451
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,214
Sang-sik.

452
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,344
Yes?

453
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,262
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

454
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,177
I'm listening.

455
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,893
I'mâ¦

456
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,613
I'm pregnant.

457
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,901
They said I'm pregnant.

458
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,360
I thought so

459
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,743
when you ordered milk.

460
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,704
Whatâ¦

461
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,747
should I do?

462
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,367
Please take it well.

463
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,584
This is the day to remember forever.

464
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,252
Okay, I will.

465
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,587
One, two, three.

466
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,552
Canâ¦

467
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,795
the two of us be alone, please?

468
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,215
Why? What are you going to do?

469
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,514
It's wrong

470
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,308
for a father to not remember his children.

471
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,910
Go somewhere else.

472
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,288
Dad doesn't remember us at all, right?

473
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,876
He can't remember you either?
He adores you.

474
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,764
Think logically.

475
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,046
If his memory is in 1982,
I wasn't born either.

476
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,269
So Dad is living in a time
when he and Mom were super romantic?

477
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,651
How can you tell
such a joke at this moment?

478
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,453
How are you two so natural together?

479
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,910
Are you sure you haven't
seen each other for years?

480
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,620
Was I the only one who was worried?

481
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,370
Did you two meet without telling me?

482
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,962
Customer number 21, your order is ready.

483
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,537
Go get the coffee.

484
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,840
Wait. Weren't you coming with Chan-hyuk?

485
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,511
Go get the coffee, please.

486
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,420
Go.

487
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,194
I heard

488
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,647
you called Ji-woo out of nowhere
and asked where his office is.

489
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,445
Do you still drunk dial people
and make mistakes?

490
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:42,747
A breathalyzer cell phone that stops you
from calling would win a Nobel Prize.

491
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,827
I remember Chan-hyuk.

492
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,998
But now, he's Ji-woo's boss

493
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,535
before he's your friend.

494
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,958
It's not that kind of company.

495
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,467
Ji-woo calls him by his name.
They're like brothers.

496
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,339
All companies work the same way.

497
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,836
If he pays him, he's the CEO.

498
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,808
If he works at a place that pays,
that's a company.

499
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,562
Is he family with Ji-woo
and friends with you?

500
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,523
Draw your lines clearly.

501
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,023
All right.

502
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,895
I'll never mess things up with Chan-hyuk.
Don't worry.

503
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,862
Don't say "never" that easily.

504
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,445
Eun-joo must be living her life
so comfortably.

505
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,366
Why?

506
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,830
She never hesitates to point out
other people's flaws.

507
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,825
I'm sure she's never stressed.

508
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,590
But you're not other people.

509
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,510
I'm worried about you, that's all.
Is it so hard to say, "Okay?"

510
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,219
Okay.

511
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,147
He's been saying that
he'll go to the mountains,

512
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,993
take a bottle full of sleeping pills,
and fall asleep to his death.

513
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,582
Eat all of it.

514
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,801
Am I sick right now?

515
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,432
It was an accident.

516
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,758
You went hiking and went missing.

517
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,386
I see.

518
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,887
Did I go hiking alone?

519
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,476
I guess so.

520
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,900
Did I go hiking aloneâ¦

521
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,435
quite often?

522
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,356
They said if you don't ask questions
and just be natural,

523
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,986
your memories will come back.

524
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,656
Okay.

525
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,206
So I shouldn't ask questions.

526
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,576
So we'reâ¦

527
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,296
still awkward with each other
even at this age, right?

528
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,680
Here's the medicine.
Take it after the meal.

529
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,846
Thank you.

530
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,152
Why? Do you need something?

531
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,772
It feels like I'm having a weird dream.

532
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,698
What are the names

533
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,159
of our children?

534
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,529
They're Eun-joo, Eun-hee, and Ji-woo.

535
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,663
Is Eun-joo the eldest?

536
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,328
Yes.

537
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,247
Eun-joo, Eun-hee and Ji-woo.

538
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,549
I want to

539
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,467
meet them properly.

540
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,158
Eun-joo?

541
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,328
I'm Kim Eun-hee, the second daughter.

542
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,207
This is Kim Eun-joo, the eldest daughter.

543
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,419
Kim Ji-woo, the youngest son.

544
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,924
I see.

545
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,757
Eun-joo, my eldest daughter.

546
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,594
Yes.

547
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,885
He only cares for his eldest daughter.

548
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,022
Are you okay?

549
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,230
Should I call a doctor?

550
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,140
Should I?

551
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,597
No.

552
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,478
It's okay.

553
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,737
Dad, should I play the songs
from the 1983 Campus Song Festival?

554
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,858
What?

555
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,034
Campus Song Festival?

556
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,620
It'd be like your first time hearing it.

557
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,121
It must feel like you're time traveling.

558
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,673
Hey, he has to rest.

559
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:41,459
I think all of you should go home.
It's not that spacious here anyway.

560
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,917
We're leaving.

561
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,842
Get some rest.

562
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,474
Bye, Dad.

563
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,432
Bye.

564
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,444
I'm going home to get Mom's things
she might need at the hospital,

565
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,936
so take Eun-joo home.

566
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,157
Will you pay me for the ride?

567
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,874
What are you going to do
with all that money?

568
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,790
Are you going to move out, too?

569
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,408
I can't move out.

570
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,577
Wait.

571
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,792
Is the graduation from marriage
going to fail like this?

572
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,004
I'm sure she'll take care of it
when Dad recovers.

573
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,968
Mom didn't just say it.

574
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,048
I'm against it.

575
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,880
Eun-joo, you were against it.

576
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,678
Tell them you're against it.

577
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,601
I don't want to hear that word.

578
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,180
If they can't live together,
they should get a divorce.

579
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,559
-Was Tae-hyung here?
-Yes.

580
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,773
Are they not getting along?

581
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,528
It didn't seem so.

582
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,992
Go on.

583
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,071
You might not be able to
get money for the taxi.

584
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,370
-Call me.
-Okay.

585
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,420
I'll drive you safely to your destination.

586
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,298
Why is Eun-hee standing there, zoning out?

587
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,509
Is she dating these days?

588
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,763
I donât think so.

589
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,054
A few days ago,

590
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,217
she said all her romance cells have died
and she's not lonely either.

591
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,357
I'm going to get delivery food.

592
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,534
What have you been doing
not eating until now?

593
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,199
I brought lunch boxes. It's for two.

594
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,369
Eat this.

595
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,458
How come you didn't eat until now?

596
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,920
I lost my appetite earlier.

597
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,172
Since you came back without eating,

598
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,922
my appetite is suddenly back.

599
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,640
Relax, okay?
And don't make that ridiculous face.

600
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,266
When I think of the effortâ¦

601
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,439
Well, that's clearly bought,
but that's still effort, right?

602
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,769
But if that effort
makes someone uncomfortable,

603
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,364
then they shouldn't take it.

604
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,278
Then should I eat all of this on my own?

605
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,492
CEO.

606
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,735
You put your rent deposit
on this company, right?

607
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,544
You used all your rent deposit at that age

608
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,040
and you feel uncomfortable
living with your parents,

609
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,379
so you're sleeping on the sofa.

610
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,923
I wish Ji-woo and Young-ho
were as sharp-witted as you are.

611
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,375
They think the company
is doing much better now.

612
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,845
So you bought this because you pity me?

613
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,600
Now that makes me feel relieved.

614
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,683
Help yourself.

615
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,939
By the way, why were you two
in the office at that hour?

616
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,435
There was a reason.

617
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,818
Did you sleep with her?

618
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,815
Hey!

619
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,908
I'm fine with you being rude
and talking down to me.

620
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,413
You're good at work and life.

621
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,044
So keep to those two.

622
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,788
Ms. Kim Eun-hee has no feelings for you.

623
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,543
So don't do anything stupid.

624
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,797
Tell me one stupid thing that I've done.

625
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:17,681
The photos you take show your emotions.

626
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,558
The photo you took of her
showed that you like her.

627
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,893
Have you been doing
stupid things for a long time?

628
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,083
I've been a great photographer
since this time.

629
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,792
Did she look old back then?
She looks the same as now.

630
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,876
Actually, she looks younger now.

631
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,338
You have a long way to go
before you understand my photos.

632
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,889
Don't ever let her see that photo.

633
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:06,442
If someone was keeping
a photo of me without telling me,

634
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,808
I'll surely misunderstand.

635
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:12,017
"He's madly in love with me."
She might die from her heart fluttering.

636
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,742
Now that makes me want to test it.

637
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,281
A call from Kyung-ok.

638
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,325
KYUNG-OK

639
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,169
Did you go home safely yesterday?

640
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,790
Are you feeling okay?

641
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,882
Did you relieve your hangover?

642
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:20,381
You were the one who got drunk.
I never lose my consciousness.

643
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:26,215
By the way,
that Vice CEO is quite American.

644
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,139
What?

645
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,305
He was so touchy on our way to the taxi.

646
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,653
It was no joke.

647
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:39,191
And when the taxi came, he tried
to get in with me in the back seat.

648
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,988
I blocked him with my entire body.

649
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:47,042
Even if he's lonely,
that's a wrong thing to do.

650
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,999
Kyung-ok, I'm driving right now
and the road is so crowded.

651
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,791
Okay, then. See you on Monday.

652
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,253
Bye.

653
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,569
Dad's saying he's 22 years old.

654
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,978
Get it together.

655
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,822
CHATS

656
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,661
NATIONWIDE LARGE TRUCK DRIVERS

657
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,050
Do you remember something?

658
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,546
This thing is incredible.

659
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,813
What's even more incredible is,
I think I know how to use it.

660
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,017
Ms. Sook, do you have
this kind of phone too?

661
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,486
It's 22-9438.

662
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,654
That's your home phone number.

663
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,446
Remember?

664
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,657
Do you know how much I ran here and there

665
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,583
to find phone booths
to call you at 9:00 sharp?

666
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,167
Do you remember it too, Ms. Sook?

667
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,415
Do you remember it too, Ms. Sook?

668
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,590
I don't remember it at all.

669
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,644
How could you forget?

670
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,231
Whenever I heard your voice,

671
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,769
I thought my heart would explode
and die from happiness.

672
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,065
You forgot about that?

673
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,688
Then,

674
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,572
what happened to the Diamond Game?

675
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,315
The bet was to get 100 points first.

676
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,527
I got 59 and you got 50.

677
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,497
Aren't you acting like you forgot
because you were losing?

678
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,376
I was losing by 59 to 50?

679
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,748
I was so good at the Diamond Game.

680
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,917
See? You remember it, too.

681
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,877
To be honest, I was losing.

682
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,178
I got 50 and you got 59.

683
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,064
Who won?

684
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,019
Did it end boringly with your victory?

685
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,351
The winner was supposed to kiss the loser.

686
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,187
Miss Sook, did you kiss me?

687
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,232
What are you doing?

688
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,895
Why?

689
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,707
-Hi.
-Hi.

690
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,920
Stay seated.
I'll join after ordering coffee.

691
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,839
Did you go somewhere?

692
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,636
How about a strong coffee today?

693
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,298
You drink strong coffee
when you're in a bad mood.

694
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,717
I'm a bit tired. Add an extra shot.

695
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,767
Okay.

696
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,649
Ms. Kim, stay seated. I'll bring it.

697
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,532
It's okay. I'll bring it.

698
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,399
No, I'll bring it.

699
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,963
Because of a newbie,
we have to have coffee get-togethers

700
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,001
even if we get out early on the weekends.

701
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,875
The barista is good-looking.

702
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,630
Just give it to me.

703
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,102
-Here.
-Thank you.

704
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,281
So it's this photo.

705
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,952
Dad was 22 years old at the time?

706
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,948
Neither of them seems like it, right?

707
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,115
Does aged look run in the family?

708
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,163
Mom and I don't look aged.

709
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:04,207
Maybe Eun-joo looks old
because she takes after Dad.

710
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,252
Did Eun-joo give you money for a taxi?

711
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,264
I got it.

712
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,009
But she told me to drop her off
at a cafe in front of her house

713
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,555
saying she needs strong coffee.

714
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,925
-A cafe in front of her house?
-Yes.

715
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,353
Eun-joo speaks casually
to the part-timer there.

716
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,266
-You know it, too?
-Know what?

717
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,824
Well, you know.

718
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,531
That part-timer is in great shape.

719
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,202
And didn't Eun-joo's style change a lot?

720
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,282
She hated long hair and makeup.

721
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,656
And since when did she
like coffee that much?

722
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,576
Hey!

723
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,333
What are you thinking?

724
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:44,995
I'm going to tell her.

725
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:49,003
"Eun-joo, Ji-woo said you fell
for a part-timer who's in a great shape

726
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,417
and you dress up all nice for him!"

727
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,506
Come on. That's not it.

728
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,680
The mystery of DNA.

729
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,557
Your expression looked exactly like Dad's.

730
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:07,358
Don't just take after
his expressions and grow up, okay?

731
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,695
These two became parents
when they were younger than you.

732
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,106
Eun-joo was in Mom's womb at the time.

733
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,279
I've seen this photo my entire life.

734
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,200
But I never thought

735
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,041
they were in their twenties here.

736
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,003
I know nothing
about Mom and Dad from then.

737
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,590
What about now?

738
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,012
Do you know about them now?

739
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,344
Then do you know?

740
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,640
MOM

741
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,846
CHAN-PAL

742
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Hi, Mom.

743
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,651
While your Dad was unconscious,

744
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,656
the deactivated part of his brain
might've been stimulated

745
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:02,079
or the active part of his brain
might be asleep temporarily.

746
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,290
He talks and behaves a bit like a child.

747
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,711
You said he's 22.

748
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,170
I was a grown-up when I was 22.

749
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,590
Wait.

750
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,170
What if it's dementia?

751
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,755
Not all brain-related
sickness is dementia.

752
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,184
He won't have any problems
with his daily life.

753
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,347
The body remembers what it can do.

754
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,348
I'm sure he'll drive if he sits in a truck

755
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,218
and know its functions.

756
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,523
-Is your arm going to be okay?
-It's okay.

757
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,685
-Why did he get hurt?
-I don't know.

758
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,315
You act close, but you don't know?

759
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,200
Is something bothering you?

760
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,127
Hey.

761
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,588
Eun-joo.

762
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,298
Dad asked me
to bring the Diamond Game board.

763
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,879
Is he regressing?

764
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,256
Ask Tae-hyung.
Does he have dementia or something?

765
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,600
It's not dementia.

766
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,020
Don't say stupid things
without knowing anything.

767
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,561
If he needs something, bring it to him.

768
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,643
I'm hanging up.

769
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,742
What did Iâ¦

770
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,450
What did I do to be scolded like that?

771
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,488
Good grief.

772
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,200
{\an8}DIAMOND GAME

773
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:30,918
What is that?

774
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,592
Dad asked me to bring it,
so he can play it.

775
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,169
Diamond Game? All of a sudden?

776
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,877
That's weird.

777
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,010
Is this an early symptom of dementia?

778
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,553
She said it isn't.

779
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,558
She told me not to say stupid things.

780
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,927
I asked Eun-joo and got scolded.

781
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,102
That's who she is.

782
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,065
I'm guessing you have to go back
to the hospital with Mom's clothes.

783
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,186
-What did Chan-hyuk say?
-What?

784
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,951
You were on the phone with him.

785
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,320
Right.

786
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,816
He asked how Dad was doing.

787
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,660
I was the last person
Dad talked to on the phone

788
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,457
before he went on the nighttime hike.

789
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,460
He told me

790
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,505
to live happily and joyfully with you.

791
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,054
Like he knew there would be an accident.

792
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,934
To live happily and joyfully.

793
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,635
I thought about it

794
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,312
and Dad was the only one who never asked,

795
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,975
"Why aren't you having a kid?"

796
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,766
"How's the hospital business going?"

797
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,606
"Are your in-laws nice to you?"

798
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,986
He never asked such questions.

799
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,494
He always just tells me
to live happily and joyfully with you.

800
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,873
He knows that I've been trying hard
to have a baby for years.

801
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,327
Butâ¦

802
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,590
I think he also knew I gave up.

803
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,837
I gave up.

804
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,427
I went back to the life of drinking
multiple cups of strong coffee.

805
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,311
Can the two of us really live

806
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,942
happily and joyfully without children?

807
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,205
Ms. Sook, is he bringing
the Diamond Game board?

808
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,130
You're going to play me, right?

809
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,094
Ms. Sook, I'll wipe it.

810
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,669
Stop calling me Ms. Sook.

811
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,718
I see.

812
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,854
I don't call you Ms. Sook anymore?

813
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,273
Then what do I call you here?

814
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,805
I mean, now?

815
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,274
What do I call you now?

816
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,694
Hey.

817
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,614
Hey.

818
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,225
Eun-joo.

819
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,819
Eun-hee.

820
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,914
Ji-woo!

821
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,449
Hey, you!

822
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,164
Just call me "You."

823
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,582
Youâ¦

824
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,340
Then what do you call me?

825
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,549
Here.

826
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,217
You left this.

827
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,940
It's time to eat.

828
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,355
Tell your father to come and eat.

829
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,079
I call you the same.

830
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,043
You.

831
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,423
You.

832
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,937
Youâ¦

833
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,942
haven't changed at all.

834
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,067
My dirty, shaggy, and gloomy room

835
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,905
without any proper items

836
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,035
shone brightly after you came.

837
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,670
And our kids shine brightly too,
perhaps because you raised them well.

838
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,302
Youâ¦

839
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,011
haven't changed at all.

840
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,148
What is it?
I don't think I left anything behind.

841
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,109
This.

842
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,975
Hey, this isâ¦

843
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,612
Let's go for now.

844
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,409
Where are we going?

845
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,793
That relieves my hangover.

846
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,174
Did Mr. Playboy call you?

847
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,379
Mr. Playboy?

848
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,996
Hey, that's just how I feel.

849
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,341
He doesn't know my number.

850
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,223
-How about you?
-I don't know his either.

851
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,561
Why did you lie to me
and make me come here?

852
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,731
Whether you know his number or not,

853
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,269
donât call him first.

854
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,813
That's quite a tacky advice
from another Mr. Playboy.

855
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:47,938
Should I be elusive?

856
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,494
No, it's about being cold and considerate.

857
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,569
Isn't considerate a kind word?

858
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,866
Cold and considerate?

859
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,909
Mr. Playboy and you.

860
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,121
The two of you know nothing
about each other.

861
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,583
-Do we know nothing?
-Then what do you know?

862
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,004
Position, qualification, age, and gender?

863
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,923
Everyone else knows that.

864
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,759
Did you ask before you made out with him?

865
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,089
"Are you a playboy?"

866
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,795
That's just how I feel.

867
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,805
-"Are you married?"
-That's not it for sure.

868
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,468
"Do you have a girlfriend?"

869
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,387
Hey.

870
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,604
Did you make me come here to say all this?

871
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,857
You always gave me advice
whenever I dated someone.

872
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,395
Hey.

873
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,728
Do you need advice too?

874
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,107
No.

875
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:41,912
When you dated Jong-pal,
you always did what he wanted.

876
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,000
You never told him
what you like and what you don't.

877
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,826
Don't do that this time.

878
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:06,098
Don't get anxious and start asking him
about what he remembers.

879
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,805
It'll come back naturally.

880
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,315
Just let him relax
and do what he wants to.

881
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,324
Okay, thank you.

882
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,623
It was small back then,
but this is big, so it's easy to see.

883
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,370
You bought this.

884
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,084
Really?

885
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,048
Your mom's coming. Let's play it with her.

886
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,593
Ms. Sook.

887
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:39,932
Come here.

888
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,640
Ms. Sookâ¦

889
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,225
I think I fell for Mr. Playboy first.

890
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,788
He acknowledged me.

891
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,121
You should've gone in first.

892
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,502
You're the best at our company,
so I must wait for you.

893
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,085
I studied a lot after I was assigned.

894
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,921
I read company newspapers

895
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,836
and studied the employees' tendencies.

896
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,797
And you had the best harmony with me.

897
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,807
The books published under your planningâ¦

898
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,637
were the best.

899
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,099
That made my heart flutter.

900
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,107
When he said the books published
under my planning were the best,

901
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,861
I was so happy I couldn't handle it.

902
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,952
I guess I was lonely
after being single for five years.

903
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,196
I feel bad for myself.

904
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,499
That's how everyone is.

905
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,671
When someone acknowledges you,
that becomes poison.

906
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,460
One time, the lady at the restaurant
in front of my office

907
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,835
gave me tons of kkakdugi
saying, "You like kkakdugi, don't you?"

908
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:03,302
I was so touched beyond words
and I only went there to eat after that.

909
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,470
Even if it had cockroaches,
I only went to that place.

910
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,729
Are you feeling lonely, too?

911
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:21,743
Good grief.

912
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,575
TINKERBELL

913
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,825
PLANNED PREGNANCY
90 DAY PLAN

914
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,202
-Mom, are you going to be okay?
-Yes, go on.

915
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,293
Dad's out.

916
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,383
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

917
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,753
Rest up. I'll be back tomorrow.

918
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,589
Okay.

919
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,740
I think you should watch this, too.

920
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,890
Ji-woo.

921
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,060
I'll count on you when Dad
leaves the hospital tomorrow, too.

922
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,765
Just go in first.

923
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,397
Yours won't need any more corrections.

924
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,070
-Send it to the company and upload it.
-Okay.

925
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,241
My father is being discharged today,
so can I step out for a while?

926
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,491
You're done. You can go.

927
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:34,822
Okay.

928
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,831
Mr. Playboy is walking toward me
in the parking lot. What to do?

929
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,307
How was your weekend?

930
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,650
Great.

931
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,862
What about you?

932
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,192
Great.

933
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,374
Don't look around with an anxious,
awkward look on your face.

934
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,576
If you care too much,

935
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,415
they'll find out
and you'll look like a loser.

936
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,295
Would you like to have lunch with me?

937
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,092
What?

938
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,842
Don't act like you didn't hear it.

939
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,177
Be honest and clear in conversations.

940
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,263
No, let's have dinner.

941
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,016
Yes, good morning.

942
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,114
Good morning, sir.

943
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,872
This is embarrassing.

944
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,083
What is it?

945
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:08,003
Who are you texting
so early in the morning?

946
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,254
Kyung-ok, stop acting cute.
It's too early in the morning.

947
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:16,587
Why? Doesn't my energy
get rid of your Monday blues?

948
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,511
I have important information
about the Vice CEO.

949
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,979
The Vice CEOâ¦

950
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,233
has a fiancÃ©e he will marry soon.

951
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,743
What are you doing?

952
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,159
I canât remember the house

953
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,535
we live in together.

954
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,166
I'm sure you'll remember if you go there.

955
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,093
Do we own that house?

956
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,175
It's under your name.

957
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,310
So I bought a house in Seoul.

958
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,991
What if my memories don't come back
even after I go home?

959
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,782
I'm worried.

960
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:23,164
The doctor told you to relax
and don't think too hard.

961
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,093
By the way,

962
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,051
I'm asking just in case I make a mistake.

963
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,511
Does our eldest daughterâ¦

964
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,812
know about it?

965
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:54,477
Eun-joo knows about what?

966
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,038
Are you going somewhere?

967
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,247
Does she knowâ¦

968
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,006
that I'm not

969
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,890
her biological father?

970
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,337
You're keeping a secret from me, right?

971
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,050
Tell Eun-joo before I tell her myself.

972
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:03,012
The fruit shop?

973
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,342
The fruit shop Mr. Yoo?

974
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:08,429
-He's jealous, too?
-Ms. Sook likes Korean melons?

975
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,434
Ji-woo, which one do you prefer?

976
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,596
Tangerines?

977
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,064
It's not that I like him.
I made a mistake.

978
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,687
You like Mr. Playboy.

979
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,611
You'll know how flustered
I am by your actions

980
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,940
once you get your memories back.

981
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,194
Don't be ridiculous.

982
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,897
You're lying about not remembering, right?

983
