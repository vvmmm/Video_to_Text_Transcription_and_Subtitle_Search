2
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,437
It's the middle of the day

3
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,987
the sky is dark.

4
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,908
Before me is the sea.

5
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:06,729
Today the sea is smooth, hefty,

6
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:09,517
with iron density

7
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,634
and without any force, it seems.

8
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:18,750
Between the sky and the sea

9
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,092
there is a very dark width.

10
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,715
It covers the entire horizon,

11
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:35,802
with the smoothness of a giant erasure,

12
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:40,634
the significance of an impassable difference.

13
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:46,601
And it could be scary.

14
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,648
In the window of my room

15
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:04,954
upright, veiled by the dark light,

16
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:07,091
my image appears.

17
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,368
I look outside.

18
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:17,658
The sailboats are still there, motionless,

19
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,135
over the iron sea,

20
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,063
still, in the movement of the waves

21
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:30,211
where they were taken by surprise by the fading of the wind this morning.

22
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,348
I'm looking at myself.

23
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:50,465
I can't see well in the cold glass of the window.

24
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:58,960
The light is so dark, it looks like night.

25
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:10,177
I love you beyond my strength.

26
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,146
I don't know you.

27
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,044
Here between the horizon and the beach,

28
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,900
a change begins to occur

29
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,055
within the depths of the sea.

30
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,782
It is slow.

31
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,958
It reaches with delay.

32
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:04,934
Against my body, this cold of glass,

33
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,130
this dead window.

34
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,311
I no longer see anything of myself.

35
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:22,687
I don't see anything anymore.

36
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:35,071
Thus, I start to see again.

37
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,996
Before me a color is born,

38
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:51,157
that is very tense, green.

39
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,294
It occupies a part of the sea.

40
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:03,854
It retains a lot from her inside that color, a sea,

41
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:08,227
but very small, you see,

42
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:12,146
a sea in the wholeness of the sea.

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,357
So the light came from there,

44
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,482
from the bottom of the sea,

45
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:29,001
of a multitude of colors in its depth.

46
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,989
And the backlight

47
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,173
came from its gushing everywhere

48
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,598
where water came out.

49
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,127
The sea becomes transparent,

50
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:56,016
of the gleam, of the shining of a nocturnal organ.

51
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:03,202
Looks like, not of emerald, you see,

52
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:08,068
not of phosphorus, but of flesh.

53
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:20,566
I've closed the doors and windows of my room.

54
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:25,854
I came back very quickly to write to you.

55
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:34,330
I stand there, with you, into the discovery of the beach.

56
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,737
I stepped away from the window, I look at myself.

57
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:53,296
The eyes are blue, they say. The hair, black.

58
00:06:54,082 --> 00:07:00,703
You see? Blue eyes under black hair.

59
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,430
How I like you to see me!

60
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,759
I am beautiful, such

61
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,794
in my strange being.

62
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,617
I smile at you and tell you my name.

63
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,348
My name is AurÃ©lia Steiner.

64
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,003
I am your child.

65
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:05,699
You are not informed of my existence.

66
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,366
You can't show signs to me.

67
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,994
Death keeps you from seeing me,

68
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,132
I know it.

69
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,530
And I see your death as a passing illusion of your life.

70
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:28,693
That, for example, of another love.

71
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,535
I don't care.

72
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,597
I am acquainted of you through me.

73
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,137
This morning, for example,

74
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:46,650
by this sudden terror,

75
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,100
without apparent purpose,

76
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:52,904
I was informed of our deep resemblance

77
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:57,793
before the chance of desire.

78
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:12,749
Sometimes other than you,

79
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,086
the others come.

80
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:19,570
They are occasionally as old

81
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,449
as you would have been.

82
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,018
In a world where you are not alive

83
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,988
they can take the place of our meeting.

84
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:43,157
By the lenght and adolescent grace of the body that I see you.

85
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:53,038
By the awkwardness of your approach, the sorrowful impatience

86
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,057
and, sometimes, tears.

87
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,155
And sometimes these calls for help too.

88
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:09,670
On the verge of pleasure it wouldn't be so far between them and you,

89
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,873
if, you, you as well,

90
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:17,056
if you could make a stop and wander about, 

91
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,109
in the streets of the port.

92
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:35,804
I give it, my body, fresh, and they take it.

93
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,551
They speak,

94
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,539
they say they love it.

95
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:51,344
They scream, they cry, they try to hurt.

96
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:57,065
I let, I let it be

97
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:09,521
to do, to penetrate , to scream of their love, to cry.

98
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,407
You could have been one of them

99
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,665
except you would have seen me.

100
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:24,113
You would have noticed this one,

101
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:28,247
this abandoned body, delivered,

102
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:31,436
this enjoyment carried away from you

103
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,690
and which this one does not want to return to.

104
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:49,974
The sea, it seems, her sound, at the bottom of the city.

105
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:03,823
Eyes closed, I would have asked you:

106
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:09,378
How do you look? 
Blond?

107
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,442
A northerly man with blue eyes?

108
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:22,351
You would've hardly taken long in answering me:

109
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:26,883
Blue-eyed, yes, but with black hair.

110
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,910
Black? Yes.

111
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:39,001
I would have asked: are you looking for someone?

112
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,712
Someone you have been told about?

113
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,096
You say: that's right.

114
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,025
You would have repeated: that's right, yes,

115
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,987
someone no way I'd have recognized

116
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:59,683
and someone I love beyond my strength.

117
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,288
I ask:

118
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,673
AurÃ©lia Steiner?

119
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:11,557
He does not answer,

120
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,357
he moves away from me, he cries:

121
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,826
How do you know?

122
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,728
I say I heard about her

123
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,746
from stopover travelers.

124
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,800
He asks, he cries.

125
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,342
I say, yes, all

126
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,133
were black-haired men.

127
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:55,680
From the closed room of the beach, alone,

128
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,841
I design your voice.

129
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:04,450
You talk and I don't hear a word

130
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,958
but only your voice,

131
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,201
the voice sleeping since a thousand-years.

132
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:18,207
From now on your voice is written

133
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,483
weakened by time

134
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,073
freed from history.

135
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,651
You would have run away

136
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,282
and I would have heard this name called in the city:

137
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:44,805
AurÃ©lia Steiner.

138
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,299
I would have kept track of the fall of the sound of those two words

139
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:56,566
until their disappearance.

140
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:05,759
As I heard the ascdening murmur of the sea

141
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:11,981
there would be no wind.

142
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,772
I still stand in this dark room facing the sea.

143
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,997
I have been alone in this house for years.

144
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:42,635
Everyone's gone to join the quieter zones of the earth

145
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,619
because of the storms.

146
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,349
Here, terrible.

147
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:03,976
In the afternoon a slow dislocation occurred

148
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:08,239
between the green and black waters of the sea.

149
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:16,038
The huge puddle turned blue.

150
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,135
The movement has returned.

151
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:28,691
The sea quivered as if under the blows of a sudden wind.

152
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,780
Whereas there was no wind,

153
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:36,955
it was the evening that arrived.

154
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,983
And I opened the doors and windows to my room

155
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:47,879
and a soft light entered.

156
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,648
The horizon had become usual again,

157
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:59,698
Smooth and clear.

158
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:22,105
My mother, dead, put to sleep

159
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,545
under the lower flanks of the camp,

160
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:30,835
burnt dead
with the victims of gas chambers.

161
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,346
AurÃ©lia Steiner, my mother.

162
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:45,595
My mother looks at the big white rectangle in front of her

163
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:48,136
of the assembly yard of the camp.

164
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,482
Her death agony is interminable.

165
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,567
Next to her side, the child is alive.

166
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:15,302
The whole sea has turned blue again

167
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,963
as always at this hour, you see?

168
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,865
It is a strong clarity 

169
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,630
just before the blushing of the night.

170
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,525
I cry, without sadness,

171
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:39,456
the evening that always falls on absence.

172
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:49,051
Here the great orange and golden beaches of heaven

173
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,237
above the sea.

174
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:58,787
Under the color it glitters, already discolored.

175
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:08,357
Here is the gold of the sky becoming milky

176
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:13,400
and then gray.

177
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:31,186
I can't do anything, I can't do anything

178
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:36,839
against the eternity that I bear

179
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,834
at the place of your last glance,

180
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:48,173
the one over the white rectangle of the camp assembly yard.

181
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,157
It was a summer's day,

182
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,113
death was winning you over.

183
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,728
You still see, I believe,

184
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:17,719
but there isn't to be any more suffering,

185
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:23,394
insensitivity has already been reached.

186
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:29,597
You bathe in the blood of my essence.

187
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:33,134
I was next to you

188
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,626
within the dust of the soil. 

189
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:48,909
Around you, hard and cracked with the sun, this German land,

190
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:55,016
this foreign land, this light,

191
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,510
this perfect summer,

192
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,652
this warm sky.

193
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:13,033
In front of you, the white rectangle

194
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,238
where they died.

195
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:36,265
The storm arrived during the night.

196
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:41,004
A little after midnight, the wind.

197
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:46,199
And after that, she, the sea,

198
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:49,643
moved by the wind

199
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,897
she followed.

200
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:01,303
She has risen to storm the city, she climbed,

201
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,477
invaded, she broke, she shattered,

202
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:12,819
she burst through the walls, the doors, the windows,

203
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,354
she carried away roofs

204
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:21,998
and the city remains thus, open, under the wind.

205
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,922
I was listening to the cries of the sea.

206
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:45,445
Just before dawn, in the ghastly white,

207
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,336
the big salt silos burst.

208
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,128
The salt poured into the sea.

209
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,508
Its salinity has become fatal.

210
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:09,879
She passed from life to death in seconds.

211
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:25,470
The day has risen. Then, weighed down, poisoned,

212
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,606
the sea has calmed down.

213
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:42,182
In the white rectangle of the assembly yard

214
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,175
AurÃ©lia Steiner still perceives

215
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:50,295
the hanged, soup thief,

216
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,793
who wriggle at the end of his rope,

217
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,444
????, very lightweight.

218
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,871
They can't hang on their own weight.

219
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,381
It is the morning of the second day.

220
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:18,520
My mother, eighteen years old, is dying.

221
00:24:19,563 --> 00:24:23,499
In front of her, at the end of his rope, he calls out to her, 

222
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:26,794
he cries out for mad love.

223
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,981
She can't hear anymore.

224
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:48,630
This is the place in the world where AurÃ©lia Steiner is.

225
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:57,688
She hears that the whole world is fighting the same fear.

226
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:02,575
She sees that the center of fear is shifting,

227
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:07,669
that it sinks around her, AurÃ©lia Steiner.

228
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:18,677
She sees that the whole world feared her, AurÃ©lia Steiner.

229
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:37,339
The next morning the city is still dripping,   

230
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,568
the sea recedes from the land, from the streets,

231
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,531
parks, cathedrals.

232
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,297
The boats of the port lay down on their sides.

233
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,889
The beaches are covered with dead fish.

234
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:03,431
In the sky, in the frozen sky

235
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,566
the sun is harsh, she is rotund.

236
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:11,431
The whole town falls asleep in this broad daylight

237
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,659
in the acuteness of the orange sky.

238
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:24,160
I go out into the sleepy city under the scary sun.

239
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:32,984
The sea is there, in bursts she cries again

240
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,869
and then she goes back to sleep.

241
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:37,497
A child's sleep 

242
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,717
haunted with nightmares.

243
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:46,777
The city is white with salt

244
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,984
that the sea left behind.

245
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,419
I walk.

246
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:02,669
Little by little, without me focusing on the future

247
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,595
you come back to me from exile,

248
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:11,984
from the night, from the other side of the world,

249
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:15,026
this tender darkness where you stand.

250
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,555
You go through the city.

251
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,097
I see you entering a hotel in the port.

252
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:33,677
Today you are a dark haired sailor,

253
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,028
tall.   

254
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:42,299
Always this leanness of youth or hunger.

255
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:50,166
You turned around, you hesitated

256
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:53,200
and then you walked away.

257
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,624
I know that when the night comes

258
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,411
you will go to this side of the street

259
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,730
and that you will look for her,

260
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:07,861
she, the one you met this morning in the city

261
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:10,296
and who caught your eye.

262
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:15,153
The reason for this feathery clothing, perhaps,

263
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:20,562
and that blue gaze under the black hair.

264
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:34,596
I went to lie down on the depths of the sea

265
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,114
facing the frozen sky.

266
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:42,803
She is still feverish, hot.

267
00:28:46,614 --> 00:28:50,605
Little girl, dear.

268
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:53,589
Little child.

269
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,589
I called her by different names.

270
00:29:00,678 --> 00:29:05,145
AurÃ©lia from that of AurÃ©lia Steiner.

271
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:13,425
In her depths she was still struggling

272
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:16,664
between exhaustion and the desire to kill.

273
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:26,442
Sometimes great movements lifted her up.

274
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:30,978
Love.

275
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,848
All of the things that speak for us.

276
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,478
You. Child. The sea.

277
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,940
I told him about the state of the city

278
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,993
and then I told him about the story.

279
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:04,613
He was under my back

280
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:07,979
A depth of, 10 meters? 

281
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,485
Or eight hundred meters.

282
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,593
Who knows? The difference did not exist.

283
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:24,195
The surface was pure illusion,

284
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:28,183
an open tear.

285
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:32,324
A silk of icy air.

286
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:35,989
I spoke to him for a long time.

287
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:44,363
I told him about the lovers in the white rectangle of death.

288
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,134
I sang.

289
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:55,826
I was talking to him and listening to the story.

290
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:58,921
I felt her under me

291
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:05,620
she, the sea, of the irrefutable strength of God.

292
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,793
When I got home, a newsagent

293
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,871
shouted the headlines of 'the wrath of the sea'.

294
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:31,534
In my room, I rinsed my body and my hair with fresh water

295
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:35,659
and then I waited for the young sailor with black hair.

296
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:42,051
It is while waiting for him that I am writing to you.

297
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:49,295
It is with the trembling desire I have for him, that I love you. 

298
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:55,932
I bring them together through you

299
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,435
and with the bunch of them I make you.

300
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:08,045
You are he who will not be

301
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,870
but who thence is.

302
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:21,977
Out of everything, you appear

303
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:25,299
always unique

304
00:32:26,382 --> 00:32:30,009
inexhaustible place of the world,

305
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,976
tireless love.

306
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,921
You are finally dead.

307
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:28,644
You had been untied of your rope, laid down

308
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,717
curled up on yourself 

309
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:37,838
in an untidy, sleepy, childish pose.

310
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:43,992
The white rectangle of the courtyard is empty,

311
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,008
except your body.

312
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,040
The lovers are dead.

313
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:03,747
You stole soup for the little girl, AurÃ©lia.

314
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:08,875
You were discovered, you were hanged.

315
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:15,810
Above you, for three days,

316
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,969
the German sky.

317
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:26,803
Before your eyes this sky full of water and fruitful rain.

318
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,571
You called for three days 

319
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:35,534
at the end of your rope.

320
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:39,744
You screamed, repeated endlessly

321
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:45,373
that a child named AurÃ©lia Steiner had just been born in the camp.

322
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:53,920
You asked that she be fed, that she is not be given to dogs,

323
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:58,031
you screamed, begged the world

324
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:03,801
that the little AurÃ©lia Steiner is not forgotten.

325
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,882
Towards the evening of the third day

326
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,256
you were shot in the head

327
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:17,603
to put an end to this scandal.

328
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:29,932
She, she was dead in the morning.

329
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,295
At her side, the child.

330
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:53,261
The words AurÃ©lia Steiner could not resonate in the camp,

331
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:56,658
they have been taken up elsewhere,

332
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:02,339
in other stages, in other areas of the world.

333
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:16,712
Towards evening here, there are always flashes of light on the horizon

334
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:20,536
even though the weather was overcast all day,

335
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:23,656
the same way if it rained.

336
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:29,471
The clouds for a moment move away

337
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:33,951
and let in sunlight.

338
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:43,038
In the evening again

339
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:48,356
I saw it again in that stroke of light on the sleeping sea.

340
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,554
I closed my eyes.

341
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,854
I just did it,

342
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:14,306
apparently I stopped writing to you.

343
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:28,030
So sometimes I see the color liquid and blue

344
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:32,819
empty eyes, already taken by death,

345
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:37,042
of the young hanged man, of the assembly yard.

346
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:43,020
I also see his youth.

347
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,670
He is eighteen too.

348
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:50,565
At that age he already reached his full size.

349
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:53,217
I don't know his name.

350
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:00,546
It's curious, you see?

351
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:09,801
I do not see the mother under the low flanks.

352
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:11,609
Nothing from her,

353
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,848
except the gesture of hiding the child.

354
00:38:39,848 --> 00:38:43,105
The dark haired sailor is behind the window.

355
00:38:45,384 --> 00:38:46,979
He looks at me.

356
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,058
He asks me where I am from.

357
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,521
I say I don't know.

358
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,420
He tells me he was on the beach.

359
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:05,648
He doesn't remember well

360
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:09,664
the woman he met in town this morning.

361
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,857
He says he met another person.

362
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:24,416
I ask him which one he desires.

363
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:29,010
He tells me the one he met in the morning. 

364
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:33,121
I tell him it was me.

365
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:46,164
I say to him: I will give you a name.

366
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,731
You will pronounce it,

367
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:55,152
you won't understand why

368
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:58,708
and yet I ask you to do it,

369
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:01,518
to repeat it

370
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:06,420
without understanding why,

371
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,834
as if there was nothing to understand.

372
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,952
I tell him the name:

373
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,431
AurÃ©lia Steiner.

374
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:30,222
I write it down on a blank page and give it to him.

375
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:35,640
He deciphers slowly,

376
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:42,700
then he looks at me to see if he has read correctly.

377
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,015
I do not say anything.

378
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:49,743
I lie down next to him.

379
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:58,501
He repeats the name, he sees that I am listening to him.

380
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:03,524
He is clumsy at first

381
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:06,894
not knowing in which language to say it.

382
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:19,239
And then he throws the paper away, he comes back to me,

383
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:23,276
he talks to me with the name.

384
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:32,732
One would say he had all the time in the world.

385
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:44,660
He begins to discover the body of AurÃ©lia Steiner.

386
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:55,683
She still doesn't look, her eyes closed

387
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,363
on the white rectangle of death.

388
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:11,564
Sometimes he says the whole name,

389
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:14,569
sometimes he only says the first name,

390
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,072
sometimes the last one.

391
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:25,518
He can no longer say any other name.

392
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,056
He says it in between kisses,

393
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:33,119
lips against the skin.

394
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:36,962
He says it in a low voice.

395
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:40,835
He shouts them.

396
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:46,341
He calls them inside the body,

397
00:42:47,262 --> 00:42:49,258
against the mouth,

398
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:52,859
against the wall.

399
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,001
Sometimes he stands still.

400
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,636
As if he lost the memory of the names.

401
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:12,311
And then whispering, he says it again.

402
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:18,666
In a painful effort, 

403
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:28,572
as if the utterance itself was painful.

404
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:35,130
He says: JÃ¼din (Jewess)

405
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:39,066
AurÃ©lia the Jewess.

406
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,254
AurÃ©lia Steiner the Jewess.

407
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:02,478
He is standing still, entering AurÃ©lia Steiner's body

408
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:05,978
and he stays there,

409
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:13,117
always in the extreme care to carry out the torture to its end.

410
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,997
Then he enters the body.

411
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:24,960
In a very slow movement

412
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,044
in contrary to his overflow,

413
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:34,466
he enters the body of AurÃ©lia Steiner.

414
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,559
Slowness makes lovers scream.

415
00:44:57,374 --> 00:45:02,247
Again he says the name,

416
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:07,784
he repeats them in low tone again.

417
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:16,506
He said the names again.

418
00:45:19,923 --> 00:45:21,536
He repeated it again,

419
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,795
but without voice, in a brutality that was marked

420
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,079
by an unknown accent.

421
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:37,903
I woke up at dawn.

422
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,821
The dark haired sailor was lying on my bedroom floor.

423
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:44,550
He was looking at me.

424
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:54,152
I heard him say his eyes burned him

425
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:58,494
for watching the beauty of AurÃ©lia Steiner,

426
00:46:00,462 --> 00:46:02,498
that his boat was leaving at noon,

427
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:05,895
but that he would not be on board,

428
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,192
that the boat would leave without him,

429
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,463
that he wished to stay with AurÃ©lia Steiner,

430
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:15,346
whatever becomes of him.

431
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:23,381
I said I didn't belong to anyone in particular,

432
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,863
that I was not free of myself.

433
00:47:01,715 --> 00:47:05,366
My name is AurÃ©lia Steiner.

434
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:11,586
I live in Vancouver where my parents are teachers.

435
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:15,821
I am eighteen years old. I write.
