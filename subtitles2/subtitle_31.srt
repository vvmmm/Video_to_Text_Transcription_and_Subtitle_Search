My knightâ¦

00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,553
finally got the king.

00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,926
<i>Don't you know what I did for you?</i>

00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,564

Candidate, what is this video?

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,073
Who are you stabbing?

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,276
NO TAEHYUN, CHOI SEUNGJUN, JEON DONGSEOK

00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,315
CHAIRMAN OF THE HEARING

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,405
It's Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,167
The man who got stabbed in the neck
by Gu Jingi

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,714
was a witness to this hearing.

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,761
He is Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

HEARING FOR GU JINGI,
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE CANDIDATE

18
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,294
ONE DAY BEFORE
GU JINGI'S CONFIRMATION HEARING

19
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,288
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,827
Was it Gu Jingi's order?

21
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,083
Did he make you find out
about Kwon Yoonseok's condition?

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,380
You don't have to answer me.

23
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,966
I can ask Gu Jingi myself.

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,929
Don't do that. Fine.

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,431
You're right.

26
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,425
Chairman Gu told me

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,520
to find out if Kwon Yoonseok
can recover in any way.

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,318
Go tell Gu Jingi

29
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
that Kwon Yoonseok is brain dead.

30
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,201
Don't tell him that you were caught.

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,700
Tell him he's brain dead?

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,951
That way, he'll trust you even more.

33
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,703
And meet him tomorrow
before he attends his hearing

34
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,121
to ask about that night five years ago.

35
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,512
And? Then what?

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,380
Just ask him. That's all.

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,928
Let me know where you two will meet.

38
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,979
As you already know, Gu Jingi is a man

39
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,525
who always betrays before he's betrayed.

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,027
Dr. Lee Dohyung.

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,619
Don't get framed
for other people's crimes.

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,655
Just be punished for what you did.

43
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,616
It's a piece of advice
as an attorney and your junior.

NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

45
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,144
What he said isn't wrong.

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,850
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,604
Hello.

48
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,774
Have you thought about my offer?

49
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,573
I didn't get a minute of sleep last night.

50
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,069
I mean, ten billion won?

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,662
My offer still stands.

52
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,025
Aren't you with Dr. Han Yihan?

53
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,447
Why did you tell me to ignore you?

54
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,615
At times, I have to fool my own team

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,000
to carry out a perfect plan.

56
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,586
It's simple.

57
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,801
We will ruin Gu Jingi to get our freedom,

58
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,971
and you will get ten billion won as well.

59
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,226
EPISODE 14

60
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,572
I will get my freedom

61
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,077
and ten billion won too.

62
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,788
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

63
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,213
My gosh, he surprised me.

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,631
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

65
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,169
It's such odd timing.

66
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,126
Yes, sir. This is Lee Dohyung.

67
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,295
Are you ready to appear as a witness?

68
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,264
Yes, I'm ready.

69
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,684
But--

70
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,142
Before you go there,

71
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,517
I need you to help me one more time.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,980
<i>Tell Ms. Cho and Ms. Jung to come</i>

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,270
<i>to the assistant director's office now.</i>

74
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,194
Tell them you need to discuss something
as my witness.

75
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,194
Yes, and then what?

76
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,066
Contact the head of the Security Team

77
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,236
and come to my spot
in the underground parking lot.

78
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,281
<i>I'll be waiting there.</i>

79
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,084
Why? Is that too hard to do?

80
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,036
No.

81
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,712
I'll do as you say.

82
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,424
I'll see you soon.

83
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,718
Well. Things worked out by themselves.

84
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,728
<i>I'm to meet Chairman Gu Jingi.</i>

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,100
I'll see him
at his parking spot in Banseokwon.

86
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,307
I'll bring it up then.

87
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,357
Don't overdo it.
You might get yourself in trouble.

88
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,397
It feels uncanny

89
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,067
to have you worried about me.

90
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,698
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,670
THREE HOURS BEFORE
GU JINGI'S CONFIRMATION HEARING

92
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,751
Hi.

93
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,548
I kept them in the room as you instructed,
Chairman Gu. I mean, Minister Gu.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,470
-Good work.
-It was my pleasure.

95
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,642
You promised to make me the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

96
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,771
Mr. Cheon, get in the car.

97
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,888
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,057
Yes.

99
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,942
Yes. You will be the director of Banseok
University Medical Center from now on.

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,730
I will protect
your medical license as well.

101
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,568
Thank you. Thank you so much, Minister Gu.

102
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,162
Thank you.

103
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,117
Sir.

104
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,204
What is it?

105
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,406
I mean,

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,920
I thought I should know this
before I attend the hearing as a witness.

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,880
What is it?

108
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,381
Wellâ¦

109
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,221
That incident in Banseokwon
five years ago.

110
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,304
-Sure.
-Who was the VIP

111
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,927
that received
the heart transplant surgery?

112
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,179
I mean,

113
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,727
I couldn't dare to ask until now,
but I've always had a question.

114
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,903
I mean, who could it have been

115
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,742
for you to take such a drastic measure
to find the person a heart?

116
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,861
You suddenly wanted to know that?

117
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,371
Come to think about it,
we've known each other for a long time.

118
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,997
We've worked together

119
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,252
ever since you became an anesthesiologist.

120
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,995
About 20 years now.

121
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,626
I see, 20 years.

122
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,051
What a long time.

123
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,933
I left you by my side
for such a long time,

124
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,524
but you can never tell
what's on someone's mind.

125
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,557
Sorry?

126
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,484
No, wait.

127
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,284
It looks like
you got an irresistible offer.

128
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,695
-I didn't think--
-This is nothing.

129
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,445
-Let go!
-Chairman Gu, it's not--

130
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,086
Please spare me.

131
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,564
Don't you know what I did for you?

132
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,852
-How dare you do this to me?
-Sir!

133
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,020
Whyâ¦

134
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,655
Keep it safe
until the confirmation hearing is over.

135
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,669
What should I do?

136
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,169
We're at the hospital,
so he'll survive once we move him up.

137
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,511
Do you know what I regret the most?

138
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,918
Five years ago in the detention center,

139
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,340
letting Han Yihan go alive.

140
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,347
If I took care of him as you suggested,

141
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,352
I wouldn't have been annoyed like this.

142
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,893
Deal with him.

143
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,097
-And keep this place off-limits.
-Yes, sir.

144
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,441
I amâ¦

145
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,944
sick and tired of this.

146
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,899
Why does everyoneâ¦

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,202
annoy me like this?

148
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,249
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

149
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,928
CHAIRMAN OF THE HEARING

150
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,968
WITNESS, CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

151
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,903
Ms. Cho.

152
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,234
What's going on?

153
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,435
Did he really kill him?

154
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,243
Why won't he pick up?

155
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,793
Move aside.

156
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,460
No, I'm told to keep you two safe--

157
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,709
Do you still not get it?

158
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,880
Chairman Gu Jingi is finished.

159
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,961
If you don't want to end with him,

160
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,336
give me my phone back and move aside.

161
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,651
If I short sold that at the maximum price
just as you said,

162
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,401
<i>I would have made over 50%
in today's trade.</i>

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,235
It's not just 50%.

164
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,359
It'll plummet for the next few days.

165
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,696
We would have made
over 80% of the shorted price.

166
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,450
Thanks a lot.
Thanks to your useless meddling,

167
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,326
we lost our chance to make
tens of millions of dollars.

168
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,921
I'll make an official request
to have you disciplined over this matter.

169
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,335
All of our conversations

170
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,456
are already recorded.

171
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,836
You!

172
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,142
Why did you kill him?

173
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,436
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

174
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,015
All he did was ask you about Seokju.

175
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,833
Gu Jingi.

176
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,656
You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Dohyung.

177
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,116
You may choose to remain silent,

178
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,330
and you have the right to an attorney.

179
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,801
Although it'll be useless.

180
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,885
We must take the suspect away.
Please move aside.

181
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,229
-Move aside!
-Please move.

182
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,079
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
-He's coming!
-Say something!

184
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,916
-Did Mr. Lee Dohyung die?
-Do you admit?

185
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,208
-Any words on the video?
-Please say something!

186
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,462
-A word, please.
-What happened in the video?

187
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,915
-Did Mr. Lee die?
-Say something!

188
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,125
Can you explain how you got a heart

189
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,585
for a VIP patient
at Banseokwon five years ago?

190
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,006
-Say something!
-Do you admit?

191
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,885
-Do you admit to your charges?
-Did he die?

192
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,313
Say something!

193
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,846
We're both on our own from now on.

194
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,572
-Did he die?
-Anything to say?

195
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,190
-Do you admit to your charge?
-What happened?

196
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,066
Howâ¦

197
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,118
How can he kill a man?

198
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,662
It makes no sense.

199
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,502
Ms. Pyo, you know, don't you?

200
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,921
Why did my husband hurt
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung?

201
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,835
And what's this
about taking out a patient's heart?

202
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,465
I don't know.

203
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,878
You can't just say you don't know
in this situation.

204
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,006
I need to know what's going on
before I can take a measure!

205
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,176
I heard about his plan
to stop other witnesses

206
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,345
from attending his confirmation hearing
by using Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

207
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,096
But he didn't tell me anything else.

208
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,943
I think he gave a separate order
to Mr. Cheon Hyungu.

209
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,276
Mr. Cheon?

210
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,988
Where is he? Bring him in right now.

211
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:05,121
Well, I haven't been able to reach him
after Chairman Gu was arrested.

212
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,751
The police are looking for him too.

213
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,955
Hyunseong, is there anything you know?

214
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,291
He didn't say anything to me either.

215
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,876
What on earth have you all done
while I was gone?

216
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,763
I'm sorry, Boss. Forgive me.

217
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,063
"Boss?"

218
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,681
Do you still call me that

219
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,938
after deciding not to follow my order?

220
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,321
I was going to, but at that moment,
Susie Yoon called.

221
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,861
Yes, I'm sure you were torn.

222
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,953
That's why I gave you another chance.

223
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,778
Yet you chose to betray me to the end.

224
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,790
You're right. Everything was my mistake.

225
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,620
I'll own up to everything,
so please give me just one more chance.

226
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,997
You know that I've done
everything you told me until this day.

227
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,256
I'll give you one last chance.

228
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,546
Bring me 50 billion won.

229
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,138
-What?
-You lost me a chance

230
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,135
to make at least tens of billions.

231
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,608
Do you think your apology was
worth that much?

232
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,230
I forgive you for your betrayal.

233
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,527
But you must make up

234
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,405
for my loss with money.

235
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,779
Bring me 50 billion in three days.

236
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,076
If you can't,
don't ever let me see you again.

237
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,965
GU JINGI ARRESTED FOR SUSPICION OF MURDER

238
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,467
Thanks.

239
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,016
<i>Congratulations.
You're the presidential candidate.</i>

240
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,813
<i>You won't have to worry
about the primaries.</i>

241
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,567
Do end your relationship with Chairman Gu.

242
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,148
All of us at Honours Hand will provide you

243
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,701
with even more active support.

244
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,124
Okay.

245
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,579
Let's talk again later.

246
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,263
<i>I thought I should know this
before I attend the hearing as a witness.</i>

247
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,006
<i>That incident in Banseokwon
five years ago.</i>

248
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,055
<i>Who was the VIP that received
the heart transplant surgery?</i>

249
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,641
<i>What a long time.</i>

250
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,388
<i>Come to think about it--</i>

251
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,800
I think I found it. Come here.

252
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,984
Look at Gu Jingi's eyes.

253
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,846
He's looking at Lee Do-hyung's chest
instead of his face.

254
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,056
His chest?

255
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,855
Is he looking at his fountain pen?

256
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,109
I think so.

257
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,860
He continues to look at the fountain pen,

258
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,662
-then he takes it.
-Yes.

259
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,829
After that,

260
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,043
when Lee Dohyung tries to take it back,
he stabs him in the neck.

261
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,249
The fountain pen.

262
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,709
Wait, maybe it's that thing.
A fountain pen camera.

263
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,507
Some reporters use it in secret
while covering a case,

264
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,507
although they shouldn't.

265
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,058
He found the fountain pen camera

266
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,271
and stabbed him abruptly.

267
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,100
He must've been stressed out
right before his hearing.

268
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,599
But still, how can he kill a man?

269
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,978
He was once a respected doctor,

270
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,109
but he has hit the rock bottom.

271
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,083
Chairman Gu, from now on,

272
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,291
you must share everything with me
without hiding anything.

273
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,077
That's the only way I can keep you safe.

274
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,296
Did Nam Hyukchul kill Park Kitae

275
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,668
because of your order?

276
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,680
You're right. It was my order.

277
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,509
What's the reason?

278
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,005
I told him to bear false witness
in Geum Seokju's case

279
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,982
five years ago,

280
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,021
and he tried to share that in court.

281
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,399
That's the only reason why you killed him?

282
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,066
By any chance, does this have
anything to do with taking out

283
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,948
someone's heart five years ago,
just as Assistant Director Lee said?

284
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,122
That's nonsense.

285
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,252
I wouldn't do something that ridiculous.

286
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,043
I'll spend the rest of my life in prison

287
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,213
because of my charges of murder
and murder instigation.

288
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,258
So you don't need to know anything else.

289
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,011
You didn't prepare a weapon beforehand.

290
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,140
You can find a way

291
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,845
to reduce your sentence
to involuntary manslaughter.

292
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,893
If Mr. Cheon cooperates
with the murder instigation,

293
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,477
you'll find a way out of that too.

294
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,902
No.

295
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,072
Your job isn't to protect me.

296
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,145
It's to save Banseok.

297
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,817
-But--
-Ms. Pyo.

298
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,486
I'll take all flaws of Banseok

299
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,949
with me and go down.

300
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,914
So you must not focus on protecting me.

301
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,580
Focus on protecting my family and Banseok.

302
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,918
Protect them from Jayden and Honours Hand.

303
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,639
Give me an answer.

304
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,345
This is my final request.

305
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,389
Yes, sir.

306
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,162
How could he hide the body
in the morgue of his hospital?

307
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,286
He probably hid him here to buy time

308
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,630
before he actually
takes care of him later.

309
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,879
Did you find the fountain pen
he used as a weapon?

310
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,843
No, I think Cheon Hyungu took it.

311
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,718
The police are looking for him,
so he'll be caught soon.

312
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,222
Where's his guardian? Nobody is here yet?

313
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,766
I don't think anyone will come.

314
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,269
He's separated from his wife,

315
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,060
and their children are still teenagers,
so she can't show him to them.

316
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,605
Let's move him to the NFS for an autopsy.

317
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,784
<i>What?</i>

318
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,912
There was a hidden camera
on the fountain pen he used as a weapon?

319
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,240
Yes.

320
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,412
I think Lee Dohyung got caught
trying to record their conversation.

321
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,535
That's why Gu Jingiâ¦

322
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,713
Why did Lee Dohyung do that?

323
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,552
Why did he take such a big risk

324
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,796
to film their conversation?

325
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,587
What if someone put him up for it?

326
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,678
Someone might have told him
to film their conversation

327
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,772
for something irresistible
so that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.

328
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,651
I'll get going.

329
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,396
I only have less than a day
to hold Yoon Miseon under custody.

330
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,740
Right. If she got a heart transplant,

331
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,622
she'll need a daily dose
of immunodepressants and antibiotics.

332
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,660
So find out the drugs she took
between yesterday and today.

333
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,496
Okay, I'll check.

334
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,063
<i>What if someone put him up for it?</i>

335
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,901
<i>Someone might have told him
to film their conversation</i>

336
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,899
<i>for something irresistible
so that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.</i>

337
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,244
YOON MISEON

338
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,705
It's my resignation letter.

339
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,501
Please process it anytime.

340
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,044
Sure.

341
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,262
A prosecutor confessed to using
coercive measures before the public.

342
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,971
Of course, you should resign.

343
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,641
I am sorry.

344
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,850
You punk, why did you do that?

345
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,970
I have known you for years.

346
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,517
I know you aren't like that.

347
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,020
You don't receive bribes
or special treatments.

348
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,233
What was the reason?

349
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,234
I don't know.

350
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,476
I must have been insane back then.

351
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,447
For goodness' sake. Give me a break.

352
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,452
I will wrap things up
as a proper prosecutor.

353
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,413
It took a long time.

354
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,997
We should have met like this
five years ago.

355
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,543
Unbelievable.

356
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,546
How dare you arrest me,

357
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,628
a presidential primary candidate
over a fabricated ledger?

358
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,509
Listen carefully.

359
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,092
<i>Once I get out of here,</i>

360
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,967
I will cut off your pretty neck first.

361
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,806
Go right ahead
if you manage to get out of here.

362
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,704
I warned you to lay low for a while.

363
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,461
I couldn't do that.
It wasn't a meager amount.

364
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,618
Hundreds of billions were at stake.

365
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,628
What's the use of money?
If you're jailed for attempted murder,

366
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,960
you'll be there until you're 60.

367
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,757
That's why

368
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,340
you should help me, prosecutor.

369
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,387
Did you forget about
the Oath of the Peach Garden?

370
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,311
The Oath of the Peach Garden? It's over.

371
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,350
I just turned in my resignation letter.

372
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,095
Resignation letter? Why so suddenly?

373
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,557
You don't need to know.

374
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,651
And the person you trust as much as me,
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon,

375
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,324
got arrested and detained yesterday

376
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,657
for abetting murder.

377
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,909
If you don't trust me,
call your lawyer and check.

378
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,041
But I am not sure if she will pick up.

379
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,459
What's the password?

380
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,296
Daejun Construction, 500 million won.

381
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
Samhong Distribution, 400 million.

382
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,344
Jinhang Transportation, 600 million, andâ¦

383
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,011
Banseok Foundation, 700 million.

384
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,267
300 million, 200 million,
1.3 billion, 21 billion.

385
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,150
The total is 4.6 billion won.

386
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,688
My aide had no fear, didn't he?

387
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,447
He collected slush funds for himself

388
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,278
by using my name.

389
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,573
Sure. Let's leave it at that.

390
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,372
You got this drug administered
twice a week without fail.

391
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,004
Don't you remember what it is?

392
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,495
What's that?

393
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,336
I have no idea.

394
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,471
I knew you would react that way,

395
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,878
<i>so I prepared evidence.</i>

396
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,095
<i>I am a bit tired these days.</i>

397
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,599
<i>I shouldn't appear exhausted on TV.</i>

398
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,101
<i>Don't worry, Assemblywoman Yoon.
I will make your skin glow.</i>

399
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,765
I am in your care.

400
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,273
<i>Let me get some sleep
during the treatment.</i>

401
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,194
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

402
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,949
Who recorded this?

403
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,779
A third party's recording
can't be used as evidence.

404
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,905
It wasn't a third party.

405
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,081
It was a Banseokwon employee
who was there with her.

406
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,406
If needed, she will testify in court too.

407
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,578
Give me a break.

408
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,536
Do you think something so small like this
will bring me down?

409
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,014
<i>Every politician
who has worked as long as I did</i>

410
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,139
has such faults, okay?

411
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,559
You are right.
That's the thing with wrongdoings.

412
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,719
They begin as tiny specks of dirt.

413
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,942
I am the one who collects them.

414
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,476
But when I began collecting them,
I realized that your wrongdoings are

415
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,605
as big as a mountain.

416
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,038
Assemblywoman Yoon?
What are you doing here?

417
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,123
Do you believe me now?

418
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,205
No one has your back.

419
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,669
Assemblywoman Yoon,
tell me that he is wrong.

420
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,796
You are a presidential primary candidate,
so you can handle this.

421
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,974
Stop talking nonsense.

422
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,135
I don't even know who you are.

423
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,852
Are you kidding me?

424
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,023
I came this far

425
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,601
<i>because I trusted you!</i>

426
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,396
Investigate him thoroughly and find out

427
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,482
what Kwon Yoonseok did with my name.

428
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,987
I can't believe this woman.

429
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,990
You have a knack
for making people go insane.

430
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,066
"Woman?"

431
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,698
How dare a thug like you call me that?

432
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,825
That's right. I am a thug,
so I will be comfortable in prison.

433
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,503
But would you be okay with that,
Assemblywoman Yoon?

434
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,883
The harsh wind in prison
won't be good for your skin.

435
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,261
Your skin will shrivel up
like dried radish.

436
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,974
Calm down.

437
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,842
<i>I will find out</i>

438
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,514
which one of you is telling the truth

439
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,313
so that no one feels victimized.

440
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
You helped me in the end.

441
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,197
Why were you like that before the hearing?

442
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,909
Did you want me to hate you?

443
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,501
Five years ago, I truly believed
that Han Yihan killed Seokju.

444
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,749
But when you began to investigate
Park Kitae and Nam Hyukchul

445
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,292
and Gu Jingi asked
for my cooperation again,

446
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,626
I realized it then.

447
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,631
I had helped Gu Jingi entrap Han Yihan.

448
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,134
If you knew, why--

449
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,045
I justâ¦

450
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,844
couldn't admit it.

451
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,219
What I had done for you five years ago
made you struggle more.

452
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,484
Han Yihan told me

453
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,980
that you trusted me until the end

454
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,484
and that the hearing was my last chance
to live up to your trust.

455
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,397
That was why I testified.

456
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,369
Thanks to Han Yihan, I got to wrap up

457
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,081
as a proper prosecutor.

458
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,749
<i>An arrest warrant for Assemblywoman Yoon
has been issued.</i>

459
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,301
<i>I checked if she is taking any medication,</i>

460
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,223
YOON MISEON

461
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,804
<i>but there was nothing
other than supplements.</i>

462
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,393
Immunodepressants weren't
among the items she requested either.

463
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,483
So it wasn't Yoon Miseon.

464
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,188
If you received an organ transplant,

465
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,941
failing to take immunodepressants
can put you in danger.

466
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,982
YOON MISEON

467
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,225
Then we are back to the beginning.

468
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,189
<i>I will investigate Gu Jingi now.</i>

469
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,487
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>

470
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,203
I will find out

471
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,040
who took Seokju's heart.

472
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,659
I will also meet

473
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:30,075
the person who has the highest chance
of requesting Lee Dohyung to take

474
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,126
a video of Gu Jingi.

475
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,302
LEE DOHYUNG
DECEASED

476
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,166
<i>Five years ago.</i>

477
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,048
<i>Who was the VIP that received
the heart transplant surgery?</i>

478
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,930
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CANDIDATES OF A PARTY

479
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,484
<i>I mean, I couldn't dare to ask until now,</i>

480
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,599
<i>but I've always had a question.</i>

481
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,016
BANSEOK R AND D CENTER
CURRENT STATE OF STOCK

482
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,904
The price has been falling for two days.

483
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,819
What a surprise.

484
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,570
I didn't know
the price would fall so much.

485
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,406
This is the beginning.

486
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,578
When you release an article
about withdrawing the application

487
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,749
for the new drug for Alzheimer's disease,

488
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,958
Banseok R and D Center's stocks
will be trash.

489
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,542
Where are you, Doctor Lawyer?

490
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,547
We should celebrate our victory.

491
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,469
<i>I don't think
it's a cause for celebration.</i>

492
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,550
Lee Dohyung's body
has been found in Banseok's morgue.

493
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,676
Is that so?

494
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,893
That's unfortunate.

495
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,854
Let's meet tonight at New-Hope Law Office.

496
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,484
I have something to discuss.

497
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,981
Okay. See you later.

498
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,818
Han Yihan?

499
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,988
Yes.

500
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,621
He has something to discuss.

501
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,203
Something to discuss?

502
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,714
You still need him?

503
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,995
What do you mean?

504
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,294
Gu Jingi got destroyed

505
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,496
and Bankseok R and D Center
fell into our hands.

506
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,007
That means you no longer need him, right?

507
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,563
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO A PERSONAL MATTER

508
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,851
What a surprise.

509
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,689
I didn't know such a place was hidden
inside the law office.

510
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,741
What is it that you want
to discuss with me?

511
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,249
Is that the video from the hearing?

512
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,254
What about it?

513
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,842
The fountain pen
Gu Jingi used to stab Lee Dohyung

514
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,751
had a hidden camera.

515
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,548
Did you give him

516
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,182
that fountain pen?

517
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,362
I can't believe she is investigating
the man who killed her brother.

518
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,568
Even watching it
from the sidelines is hard.

519
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,109
Seriously.

520
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,532
But she needs to put an end to it herself

521
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,951
to make up for the past.

522
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,660
It angers me. It does.

523
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,088
That's right. I gave it to him.

524
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,514
I offered him ten billion won for a video

525
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,335
of his conversation with Gu Jingi.

526
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,349
Ten billion.

527
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,563
Why did you do that?

528
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,230
You knew I would secure
a video separately.

529
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
If I hadn't offered him money,

530
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,733
I highly doubt
he would have moved as we wanted.

531
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,107
I am a bit offended.

532
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,067
I thought you would be thankful.

533
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,120
Thanks to my work on Lee Dohyung,
you took down someone as big as Gu Jingi

534
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,492
in one go.

535
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,697
I would have taken him down without it.

536
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,672
Then Lee Dohyung wouldn't have died.

537
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,996
I am sure you knew

538
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,054
that Gu Jingi would hurt Lee Dohyung

539
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,965
if he caught something like that.

540
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,135
At Banseok University Medical Center's
morgue,

541
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,774
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung's body
was found.

542
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,401
You aren't surprised.

543
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,691
It happened that way.

544
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,565
I gave an order.

545
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,611
Mr. Cheon Hyungu simply followed my order.

546
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,657
Through the medical director
of the detention center,

547
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,081
I ordered Nam Hyukchul to kill Park Kitae.

548
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,624
I also ordered perjury

549
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,714
at your brother's trial five years ago.

550
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,785
And Assemblywoman Yoon's political funds--

551
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,417
What are you playing at?

552
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,261
Will you take the fall for everything
now that you are caught?

553
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,471
What's the matter?
I am admitting all allegations.

554
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,060
Those aren't all.

555
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,311
Geum Seokju.

556
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,362
You killed my brother.

557
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,191
<i>I drove him</i>

558
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,397
to his death.

559
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,702
Is that what you want to say?

560
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,278
I don't understand.

561
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,914
Why are you so hung up
on Lee Dohyung's death?

562
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,083
Could it be trauma?

563
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,710
For revenge, you drove the man
who used to be your friend,

564
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,420
Park Kitae, to his death.

565
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,313
Lee Dohyung was a bad man

566
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,640
who needed to be punished anyway.

567
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,480
He helped Gu Jingi

568
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,862
open Geum Seokju's chest
and take out his heart.

569
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,937
Don't tell me you believed his clumsy lie

570
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,645
about how Gu Jingi did everything.

571
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,118
Even if it was a lie,
the truth needs to be revealed in court.

572
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,739
No. Had we taken it to court,

573
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,827
he would have received
a slap on the wrist.

574
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,210
Did you want to end your revenge
in such a lackluster way

575
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,631
after five years of preparation?

576
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,684
Whom did you give it to?

577
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,894
Answer me.

578
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,475
Who received

579
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,849
Seokju's heart?

580
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,154
Prosecutor Geum.

581
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,570
Mr. Geum Seokju died
due to medical malpractice.

582
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,612
The talk about taking out the heart
and giving it to someone else

583
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,868
is Han Yihan's delusion.

584
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,541
Why? You admitted all other allegations.

585
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,206
Why are you keeping quiet
about my brother's heart?

586
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,503
I have nothing else to say.

587
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,876
I will plead the Fifth from now on.

588
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,013
Please call Ms. Pyo Eunsil, my lawyer.

589
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,926
Fine. Do what you want to do.

590
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,265
So that the world knows about
what you and Banseok did to my brother,

591
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,393
I will unveil the truth until the end andâ¦

592
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,821
Prosecutor Geum.

593
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,651
-What?
-Hey.

594
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,324
-Prosecutor Geum. Are you okay?
-Ma'am.

595
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,790
I am okay.

596
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,659
Stay outside.

597
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,753
How pitiful.

598
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,799
You have the same hereditary disease

599
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,634
as your brother.

600
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,723
Your condition will worsen
if you overexert yourself.

601
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,256
Get hospitalized for treatments.

602
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,598
It's a doctor's advice.

603
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,276
I don't know.

604
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,147
It seems

605
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,583
like you want revenge more than me.

606
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,164
What's the reason?

607
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,456
It can't be about money.

608
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,707
Why are you obsessed
with Banseok and Gu Jingi?

609
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,178
If you are curious, you should find out.

610
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,472
I intend to do so.

611
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,979
About what happened
between you and Gu Jingi,

612
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,849
I'm dying to know.

613
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,820
I guess this is
where we stop working together.

614
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,031
I had a lot of fun thanks to you,

615
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,199
Doctor Lawyer.

616
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,489
You are a brilliant man
with good judgment,

617
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,245
but there is one thing you lack.

618
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,326
You are overly clean.

619
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,585
Even when you are seeking revenge
on someone stronger,

620
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,089
you hold fast to your beliefs and values.

621
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,381
It's a type of arrogance, you know.

622
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,046
That's not how revenge works.

623
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,510
With resolution to push your opponent down
to the deepest gutter,

624
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,516
you need to tear him apart.

625
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,517
My revenge is different from yours.

626
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,111
I don't aim to destroy people,

627
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,606
but make them pay for their crimes.

628
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,203
I became a lawyer to do that.

629
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,699
Watch how I slaughter Banseok and Gu Jingi

630
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,697
and enjoy.

631
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,334
It's my last gift for you.

632
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,597
I heard that you almost collapsed again.

633
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,693
That's not true.

634
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,810
I simply ran out of breath for a second.

635
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,362
I heard everything,
so don't think about covering it up.

636
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,283
Apply for a leave tomorrow
so that you can receive treatments.

637
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,162
I'll take responsibility
and see the investigation through.

638
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,832
No.

639
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,294
Not yet.

640
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,410
Hey, Geum Seokyeong.

641
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,956
I finally have Gu Jingi behind the bars.

642
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,577
I will investigate him myself

643
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,337
and identify the VIP
who received Seokju's heart.

644
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,052
No.

645
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,264
If you don't take a leave,
I will notify the chief prosecutor

646
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,593
so he will get you off the case.

647
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,928
Give me a week.

648
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,099
Just one week.
I will finish it in that time period.

649
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,402
Even if someone else attends the trials,

650
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,573
I want to finish the investigation
with my own hands.

651
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,146
Just one week.

652
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,111
As soon as it ends,
I will drag you to the hospital.

653
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,034
I promise.

654
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,662
Andâ¦

655
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,792
don't tell Han Yihan.

656
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,590
I will tell him myself
when everything gets wrapped up.

657
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,088
The leaders of Daehan Party

658
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,138
released an official statement
about discharging Candidate Yoon.

659
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,138
Okay. I will need to hasten the surgery.

660
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,523
Now, the period after the primaries
will be more important.

661
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,190
Yes, but do you still intend
to make Director Gu Hyunseong

662
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,735
the official operating surgeon?

663
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,787
Ms. Pyo?

664
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,004
<i>It's me, Gu Jingi.</i>

665
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,917
I apologize

666
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,625
for causing trouble.

667
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,051
What do you plan to do from now on?

668
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,009
<i>Don't worry.</i>

669
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,799
I won't make an unreasonable demand,

670
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,846
such as helping me walk free.

671
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,228
But if you are going to be
the president of Korea,

672
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,935
you should protect a Korean company

673
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,189
from a foreigner who hunts for companies.

674
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,822
I admitted all allegations today
to Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

675
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,990
So please protect Banseok

676
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,742
in my stead,

677
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,865
as the next president.

678
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,075
Okay.

679
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,789
I will think of a way.

680
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,294
Thank you.

681
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,635
Do you plan to help Banseok?

682
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,427
Father, you need to cut ties

683
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,727
with Banseok and Gu Jingi.

684
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,793
Han Yihan.

685
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,876
I wanted to spend

686
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,415
more time with him.

687
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,479
YOON MISEON

688
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,735
Jayden.

689
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,278
JAYDEN LEE

690
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,701
What are you hiding?

691
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:40,119
YOON MISEON, JADEN LEE, LIM TAEMOON
GU HYUNSEONG, GU JINGI, PYO EUNSIL

692
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,923
BANSEOK FOUNDATION'S GENERAL MEETING
OF STOCKHOLDERS

693
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,001
You can't enter.

694
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,585
What are you talking about?

695
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,420
Why can't I enter Banseok Foundation's
General Meeting of Stockholders?

696
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,678
I am sorry. Mr. Jayden Lee ordered us
to keep you from entering.

697
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,971
He did?

698
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,229
Listen. It was just an altercation.

699
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,599
Even so. This isn't right!

700
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,895
I'm overseeing the Strategy Team for Asia.

701
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:08,983
Do you think it makes any sense

702
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,238
that I can't attend
an important meeting like this?

703
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,526
-Move.
-I'm sorry.

704
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,866
We're just following orders.

705
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,500
Thank you all for coming.

706
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:32,046
The stock price of Banseok R and D Center
plummeted three days in a row.

707
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,682
If the price hits the floor one more time,

708
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,850
it won't be possible
to return the investment,

709
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,679
even with all of your stocks combined.

710
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,520
To make up for the insufficient fund,

711
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,902
I would like to take Banseokwon
and Banseok University Medical Center.

712
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,896
What nonsense?
Who said you could take the hospital?

713
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,279
Are you all just going to
listen to his ridiculous demands?

714
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,573
Ms. Jang Jungok,
you should sit this one out.

715
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,657
In a couple of days, you won't be
the largest stockholder of Banseok.

716
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,905
Honours Hand will be.

717
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,957
But according to the law in Korea,
a foreigner cannot own

718
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,841
a university medical center.

719
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,378
You don't have to worry about that.

720
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,921
Once Honours Hand takes over
Banseok University Medical Center,

721
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,176
we plan to get the permit renewed
as a for-profit hospital.

722
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,930
What nonsense is he talking about?

723
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,392
-Seriously?
-Director Lim.

724
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,431
-That's not right.
-Of course not.

725
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,095
Take a look here.

726
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,444
We will combine Banseokwon
and Banseok University Medical Center

727
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,811
into a for-profit hospital.

728
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,108
As Emergency Medicine suffers
from the largest deficit,

729
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,821
we'll minimize its operation.

730
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,991
As for OB-GYN, just like Banseokwon,

731
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,990
we'll provide tailored services
to a small number of expecting mothers.

732
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,493
Restructuring will be done there.

733
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,075
As for Cardiothoracic Surgery,

734
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,119
it will no longer be operated.

735
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,714
-He'll get rid of it?
-That's nonsense.

736
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,330
Cardiothoracic Surgery
is the symbol of Banseok.

737
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,627
How could you get rid of it?

738
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,960
It may have been a good symbol
in the past.

739
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,796
But now, it suffers from
the worst social stigma due to scandals.

740
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,763
That's not an essential department.

741
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,933
I wonder if operating the department
is worth all the risks.

742
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,313
You, the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

743
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,190
could lose your medical license
at any minute.

744
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,808
I don't think there's any other option.

745
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,860
Once Banseok University Medical Center
becomes a for-profit hospital,

746
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,117
the board members here
will receive a part of the profits

747
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,250
as dividends.

748
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,085
You can decide.

749
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,458
Will you hold onto the stocks
that don't hold any value in the market?

750
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,755
Or will you receive
billions of won every year

751
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,142
as your dividends?

752
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,227
Is he serious?

753
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,436
Gu Jingi admitted to all the charges.

754
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,316
But he won't even talk
about the heart transplant

755
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,159
from five years ago.

756
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,319
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

757
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,368
A reason why
he must keep it a secret to the end.

758
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,753
How did it go with Jayden?

759
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,995
I asked him why he gave
Lee Dohyung the fountain pen.

760
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,915
But he kept mentioning revenge.

761
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,054
Revenge?

762
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,591
He told me I was doing it the wrong way.

763
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:24,557
He told me to watch
how he would destroy Banseok

764
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,598
and Gu Jingi.

765
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,930
That doesn't add up.

766
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,267
Why would Jayden want revenge on Gu Jingi?

767
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,812
It makes sense if it were vice versa.

768
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,725
I don't get that either.

769
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,744
That's why I need to meet up with Michael.

770
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,068
Michael?

771
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,243
He knows about Jayden the best

772
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,912
at least in Korea.

773
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,331
JAYDEN LEE
HEAD OF HONOURS HAND'S ASIAN BRANCH

774
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,080
Michael.

775
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,924
But do you think he will cooperate?

776
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,959
He's Jayden's right-hand man.

777
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,747
I should at least try.

778
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,761
JAYDEN LEE
HEAD OF HONOURS HAND'S ASIAN BRANCH

779
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,773
He made me do all sorts of menial tasks.

780
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,273
You're abandoning me like this?

781
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,487
I'll kill you.

782
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,778
I'll kill you!

783
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,990
One more bottle.

784
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,202
Are you sure? You already drank a lot.

785
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,626
MR. HAN

786
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,919
Han Yihan?

787
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,337
Why is he calling me at this hour?

788
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,972
Do you think I work for you?

789
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,929
<i>The person you reached is not available.
You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

790
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,557
<i>After the beep--</i>

791
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,806
He's not answering?

792
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,060
No.

793
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,824
He must've found out
we're not working with Jayden anymore.

794
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,565
<i>The phone has been turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

795
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,829
It has been plummeting
for four days in a row.

796
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,883
I don't know
if I should be happy or sad about this.

797
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,172
Don't worry.

798
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,632
Once Honours Hand becomes
a new owner of Banseok,

799
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,130
the stock price will recover.

800
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,295
Anyway, congratulations.

801
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,298
With this, you have taken control
of Banseok for sure now.

802
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,046
We should congratulate your father.

803
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,807
He's registering as a candidate today.

804
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,100
Shouldn't you be there with him?

805
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,809
No.

806
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,192
Watching it from here will be enough.

807
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,111
<i>The candidate is coming in.</i>

808
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,937
LIM TAEMOON OF DAEHAN PARTY,
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE

809
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,492
My fellow citizens.

810
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,414
Before I register myself
as the presidential candidate today,

811
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,294
I'm standing here

812
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,712
to share the direction
our country ought to take

813
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,132
in the future.

814
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,090
But how come your father
still can't give up on Banseok?

815
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,683
Gu Jingi is done for,

816
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,468
and he no longer needs
Gu Hyunseong to operate on him.

817
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,058
Is there another reasonâ¦

818
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,727
I'm not aware of?

819
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,056
Another reason?

820
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,104
<i>The low birth rate and aging societyâ¦</i>

821
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,307
Yes, there is.

822
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,227
<i>â¦will certainly become
more serious problems.</i>

823
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,782
<i>Iâ¦</i>

824
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,070
Even if Gu Jingi is completely ruined,

825
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,945
he can't betray Gu Jingi for this reason.

826
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,873
LIM TAEMOON OF DAEHAN PARTY,
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE

827
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,137
Candidate Lim, are you all right?

828
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,345
Candidate?

829
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,598
<i>I'm the ambassador to the US, Lim Taemoon.</i>

830
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,970
<i>Who are you?</i>

831
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,976
What are you doing?

832
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,765
Stop taking photos of me!

833
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,774
Please calm down.
We're in the middle of a press conference.

834
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,403
A press conference?

835
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,148
Why am I holding a press conference?

836
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,110
<i>Stop taking photos of me.</i>

837
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,237
<i>-Stop taking photos.
-Move out of the way!</i>

838
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:18,156
I think it's time
to tell you the truth now.

839
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,548
What if my father
should never be the president?

840
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,341
What will you do?

841
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,888
<i>-Stop taking photos of him.
-Move out of the way!</i>

842
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,352
<i>-Stop taking photos! Don't!
-Move! Move over!</i>

843
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,273
<i>Move!</i>

844
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,311
Don't tell me

845
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,149
he has Alzheimer's.

846
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,652
That's right.

847
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,858
He's been taking the new drug
the R and D Center developed

848
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,203
for a very long time.

849
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,316
So his illness recurred
even after he had a heart transplant.

850
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:58,624
My father is actually the victim
of the new drug.

851
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,164
But the new drug

852
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,706
is significantly effective
in treating Alzheimer's.

853
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,209
He's been taking it for a long time.

854
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,634
Why is he suddenly showing symptoms?

855
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,139
Because I swapped it.

856
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,348
He's been taking health supplements,
not the new drug for over a month.

857
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,892
I thought
the symptoms would show up sooner,

858
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,313
but it took longer than I thought.

859
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,479
-Why would you do something like that?
-Like you said, only then

860
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,405
will I be able to stay as Lim Yuna,
not the daughter of a president

861
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,819
or Gu Hyunseong's wife.

862
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,079
I told you my secret.

863
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,373
So there's something
I need to check with you.

864
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,626
I need to see
if you are my true partner I can spend

865
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,591
the rest of my life with.

866
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,729
Ambassador Lim
decided not to run for president.

867
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,104
He suddenly showed symptoms of
Alzheimer's during the press conference.

868
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,654
And Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
requested your arrest warrant,

869
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,654
and the warrant was issued.

870
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,646
You'll be transferred
to a detention center tomorrow.

871
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,616
I must meet with Jayden.

872
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,195
-Jayden?
-Yes.

873
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:24,372
Once I get transferred, call Jayden.

874
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,365
And tell him to come see me.

875
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,038
Yes, sir.

876
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,011
The very first moment I met you,
I was reminded of someone.

877
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,346
Salome.

878
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,138
She danced before the King of Judea,
Herod, on his birthday.

879
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,939
And as a reward,
she asked the king to behead

880
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,072
the great prophet, John.

881
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,897
Salome.

882
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,277
Are you saying I'm evil?

883
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,822
It means you're loyal to your desires
more than anyone.

884
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,865
If chasing desires is evil,

885
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,910
I will gladly become a villain.

886
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,054
Are you stalking me?

887
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,516
Do you know how many times
you called me yesterday?

888
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,141
I'm sorry.

889
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,015
There was something
I had to ask you in person.

890
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,653
Ask me? Why?

891
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,729
You should talk to the almighty Jayden.

892
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,736
I thought you guys were best friends.

893
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,284
Jayden didn't talk to you?

894
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,575
Are you mocking me?

895
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,373
Don't you know he fired me?

896
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,499
I didn't know.

897
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,594
And there's something
you didn't know as well.

898
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,667
That Jayden and I
aren't working together anymore.

899
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,340
What? You're not?

900
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,638
Take a seat.

901
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,886
I get the feeling
we might see eye to eye on things.

902
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,735
This footage was recorded by the camera
in the elevator to the penthouse.

903
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,531
And the security guards saw

904
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,826
Director Lim Yuna enter through
the penthouse entrance this morning.

905
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,039
Bring me the master key.

906
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,292
Pardon? But--

907
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,583
Are you deaf?

908
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,286
Bring the master key now!

909
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,536
Yes, sir.

910
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,931
The fountain pen
Lee Dohyung was stabbed with.

911
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,193
No. Jayden gave him the fountain pen?

912
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,322
You really had no idea?

913
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,226
No.

914
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,689
I didn't even know it had a camera.

915
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,068
He must have kept everything
under wraps even from you.

916
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,365
You were his right-hand man.

917
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,663
Right-hand man, my foot.

918
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,583
He fired me over one mistake.

919
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,593
We want to know
why Jayden cornered Lee Dohyung to death

920
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,881
and why he is so hostile against Gu Jingi.

921
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,430
Do you know anything?

922
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,767
Actually,
Susie Yoon and I found that odd too.

923
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,889
Jayden seemed
to get unnecessarily worked up

924
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,766
when it had to do with Banseok Foundation.

925
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,975
Susie Yoon? Who's that?

926
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,936
She's an executive
at Honours Hand headquarters.

927
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,066
She was up for the position of the head
of the Asian branch against Jayden.

928
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,993
It can be anything.

929
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,535
Anything that can tell me
about the relationship

930
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,748
between Jayden and Gu Jingi.

931
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,350
I'm not sure if this will count
as a reason to hate Gu Jingi.

932
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,523
Five years ago, he came to Korea
to invest in Banseok Foundation.

933
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,068
And Jayden was in a car accident.

934
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,199
A car accident?

935
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,239
It happened late at night,
so I wasn't at the scene.

936
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,872
He was transferred to Banseokwon
and had emergency surgery.

937
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,456
Afterward, he was in a coma
for two to three weeks.

938
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,250
<i>Who is that person?</i>

939
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,381
You don't need to know.

940
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,461
He came in three hours ago
from a car accident.

941
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,505
He won't last long.
He needs a transplant right now.

942
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,887
There really was a car accident.

943
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,096
What is it? Did you remember something?

944
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,871
If you're curious, you should find out.

945
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,826
Yes. I finally get it.

946
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,298
Salome. I quite like it.

947
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,100
She sounds like a woman
who will get anything she wants.

948
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,360
-This isâ¦
-Yes.

949
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,404
This is the freedom you gave me.

950
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,368
If I didn't take this that day,

951
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,950
I would still be the daughter
of the presidential candidate,

952
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,954
not Lim Yuna.

953
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,616
So I got this for us

954
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,829
because today is the day
when we both got freedom.

955
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,958
What? You can't take it
because it's not yours?

956
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,506
I kept wondering

957
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,932
if I passed out from the pill
because you made an honest mistake

958
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,175
or because it was a part of your plan.

959
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,902
You can't come in here.

960
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,445
I'm Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of the Medical Crime Department.

961
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,919
Who is it?

962
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,797
Hyunseong. Whyâ¦

963
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,137
"Why?"

964
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,766
I should be asking you. Why are you here?

965
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,230
Why?

966
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,739
I should have done this that night.

967
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,530
I was stupid to hesitate.

968
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,117
Look who's here.

969
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,079
Did you get your daddy's permission?

970
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,999
Right.

971
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,922
You couldn't have gotten his permission.

972
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,758
You scumbag.

973
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,143
Youâ¦

974
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,774
-Open up.
-But I was told to guard--

975
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,106
Die!

976
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,896
Die, you punk!

977
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,904
Honey, it's dangerous.
You should go upstairs.

978
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,405
Okay. Be careful.

979
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,621
Yuna.

980
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,537
I didn't know a papa's boy
like you could be this bold.

981
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,044
What a surprise.

982
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,377
You lunatic.

983
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,881
I'll kill you!

984
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,129
Open the door now!

985
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,675
Gu Hyunseong!

986
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,564
-Han Yihan.
-Come to your senses, and put that down.

987
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,612
Unless you want to join your father.

988
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,657
You should have let him do it.

989
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,907
It was your only chance
to get revenge on me.

990
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,584
No.

991
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,210
That won't be enough.

992
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,202
You were the VIP patient at Banseokwon.

993
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,289
You have Seokju's heart,

994
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,669
don't you?

995
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,386
You have a wild imagination.

996
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,984
But do you have evidence to back that up?

997
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,944
<i>It's a chance for us
to turn the table around in one go.</i>

998
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,901
Chairman Gu, Mr. Cheon brought this.

999
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,322
I guess he still has
some tricks left up his sleeve.

1000
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,488
What about Cheon Hyungu? Any progress?

1001
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,030
This rat is determined not to get caught.

1002
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,584
<i>We must find him before Gu Jingi's trial.</i>

1003
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,488
<i>I'm sure he has evidence with him.</i>

1004
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,697
<i>I'm here to save you</i>

1005
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,866
from Jayden and Honours Hand.

1006
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:34,075
<i>Don't make me use
the last card I have left.</i>

1007
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,917
You are despicable to the end.

1008
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:40,172
Do you really think I don't know
what you did to me that night?

1009
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,679
