00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:29,953
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most Merciful.

3
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:33,370
From Muhammad, the Messenger of God

4
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,047
to Heraclius, the emperor of Byzantium.

5
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:39,464
greetings to him who is the
follower of righteous guidance.

6
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,591
I bid you to hear the divine call.

7
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,817
I am the messenger of God to the people;

8
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:48,784
accept Islam for your salvation.

9
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,709
He speaks of a new prophet in Arabia.

10
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,825
Was it like this when John, the Baptist
came to king Herod

11
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,272
out of the desert, crying about salvation?

12
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,903
To Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.

13
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,638
Kisra, emperor of Persia.

14
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,495
Muhammad calls you with the call of God.

15
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:50,551
Accept Islam for your salvation...

16
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,449
embrace Islam.

17
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,722
You come out of the desert,
smelling of camel and goat.

18
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,810
To tell Persia where he should kneel?

19
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,600
Muhammad, Messenger of God.

20
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,306
Who gave him this authority?

21
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:18,742
God sent Muhammad
as a mercy to mankind.

22
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:25,274
The Scholars and Historians of Islam -
The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo
The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon

23
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:33,745
The makers of this film honour the Islamic tradition
which holds that the Impersonation of the Prophet
offends against the spirituality of his message.

24
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:45,384
Therefore, the person of Mohammad
will not be shown.

25
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,046
<i>600 years after Christ died,</i>

26
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,742
<i>when Europe was sunk in the dark ages</i>

27
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,679
<i>and everywhere the old
civilizations were falling,</i>

28
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,356
<i>Muhammad was born
in Mecca, in Arabia.</i>

29
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:07,151
<i>Mecca was then a rich trading
city, ruled by its merchants</i>

30
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,687
<i>whose wealth was multiplied
by a unique privilege...</i>

31
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:12,645
<i>they housed the gods.</i>

32
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,002
<i>Every year, at the
time of the great fair,</i>

33
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,490
<i>the desert priests brought their idols</i>

34
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,686
<i>and the images of their gods
into the custody of the Kaaba.</i>

35
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,650
<i>Once, the most holy shrine of Abraham,</i>

36
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,607
<i>the Kaaba had now
become a house of idolotry</i>

37
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:04,383
<i>hosting no fewer than
360 different gods.</i>

38
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:09,477
<i>Mecca in 610 A.D.</i>

39
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:41,754
Bilal!

40
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,523
Have you had today's count Umaya?

41
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,383
Not yet...

42
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:56,160
but this year the Gods are gold.

43
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,366
When you put the Gods and Prophet together,
you sit very pretty between hmm?

44
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,891
And more gods to place in the Kaaba.

45
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,395
Caravan from Syria.

46
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:16,788
- Hmm...they must have been running.
- They'll be thirsty.

47
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,616
Put five more men on north wells.

48
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:21,423
How many sheep shall
I have to kill for them?

49
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:22,393
70?

50
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,451
Give them a hundred.

51
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,939
Mecca must keep her
name for hospitality.

52
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,765
And ten lambs for the leaders.

53
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:42,591
Bread and water,
do the poets have in the Hakim's house?

54
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:47,446
Where verse and prose are
nightly put to slaughter.

55
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,690
And...and the bread, I swear in there,

56
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,808
is thinner than the water!

57
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:01,153
Oh...open the space, open the space,
you lovers of poetry,

58
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:05,139
to Abu Sufian, willing and which...

59
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,766
patron of the arts.

60
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:12,142
When Abu Sofyan invites the poet in,

61
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:16,058
their joy is kit and love is kin.

62
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,345
Where wines and cakes abound,

63
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:20,124
the skills of Abu Sofyan.

64
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,980
All revels and all songs begin,

65
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,105
when Abu Sofyan invites the poet in.

66
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,907
From the silkworms of China, my lady.

67
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,354
A pleasure to the limb...

68
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:53,339
and as my lady can see,
a ravish to the eye.

69
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,513
Yes, 7 lengths.

70
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,612
20 dinars.

71
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:02,430
Abu Sofyan's wife?

72
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:05,437
15.

73
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:32,759
Oh, gold! The gods of the
Kaaba have their needs,

74
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,267
their upkeeps.

75
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:48,193
Who is that man who stood there,
who looked into my soul?

76
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,428
Carry me away from here.

77
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,231
Why must Muhammad come down here?

78
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,959
Why don't you stop him?

79
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,098
He is your nephew.

80
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:04,986
Maybe he will change.

81
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:06,115
Change?

82
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:08,432
He is 40 years old.

83
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,100
It's unnatural...

84
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,936
with a rich wife, he could
afford the best of Mecca.

85
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:17,613
Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.

86
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,601
It is unnatural!

87
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,687
For a man who dares to
risk the anger of Al-Uzza,

88
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:25,186
who keeps our health.

89
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,742
Manat, the god of our prosperity.

90
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,256
Allat, the god of our
family and tribes.

91
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,314
and Hubal...

92
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:40,010
Hubal, who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate.

93
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,166
To challenge the gods within earshot
of the gods is dangerous.

94
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,145
Unreasonable.

95
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,642
Rebellious, blasphemous.

96
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:52,207
Yes, I'm afraid Muhammad
will harm himself.

97
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:08,741
I am always sad
when the great fair is over.

98
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,157
I might not see the next one.

99
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,759
Abu Talib! Abu Talib!

100
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,355
Catch your breath, Zaid!

101
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,603
Has Muhammad come down
from Mount Hira yet?

102
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,461
He's been up there three days.

103
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,137
No, no, I haven't seen him.

104
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:35,513
Khadijah hoped he might have
come to you on his way home.

105
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,430
Then he's still up there.

106
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,068
Three days.

107
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:47,601
I'm afraid for him on the mountain,

108
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,359
because...

109
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:52,097
I don't know what it means.

110
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:58,219
<i>Men see the world too well
from a mountain.</i>

111
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,032
Muhammad! Read!

112
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,926
In the name of thy Lord who created
man from His sensitive drop of blood.

113
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:44,722
Who teaches man what he knows not.

114
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:46,930
Read!

115
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,927
He's still trembling under the blanket...

116
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,053
but he has spoken.

117
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:36,329
Zaid! What happened to
my nephew on the mountain?

118
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,724
He was alone, in the cave.

119
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,557
Suddenly, an angel came in to him.

120
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:53,402
The angel said: Read!

121
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,175
Muhammad replied: I can not read.

122
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:04,300
The angel commanded again: Read!

123
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,428
In the name of thy Lord,

124
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,014
who created man from
His sensitive drop of blood,

125
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,301
who teaches man what he knows not.

126
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,229
Read!

127
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,634
Who knows if it was Gabriel?

128
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,470
It could have been a dream.

129
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:31,053
When Muhammad was coming from
the mountain, he saw Gabriel plainly.

130
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,611
In the shape of a man
standing on the horizon.

131
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,729
Wherever he looked,

132
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,846
upon every turn of
his head he saw him.

133
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,671
And Gabriel said to him again,

134
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,927
I am Gabriel...

135
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:50,593
and you Muhammad,

136
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,850
are the Messenger of God.

137
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,262
Who has he told about this?

138
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:03,430
His wife,

139
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,138
and Ali,

140
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,754
and, his friend Abu Bakr.

141
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:11,382
And you?

142
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,029
I am his adopted son.

143
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,215
Be careful to whom you talk.

144
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,965
Tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child, will protect him still.

145
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:28,594
After all...

146
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,009
they say the God of Moses

147
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:35,237
spoke to him out of a burning bush.

148
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,478
If you do not restrain
your nephew then we will.

149
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,275
He's dividing the city,
heart against house.

150
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,172
He's dividing the generations
child against parent.

151
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,720
The young are listening to him.

152
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,217
He attracts the young.

153
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:01,011
We are Arabs,
we obey our fathers.

154
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,099
Our children cannot be our teachers.

155
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:07,614
How can we accept that the man
we met in the street yesterday

156
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:10,920
can be some God's Prophet today?

157
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,267
Dead bones can live again, he says

158
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,215
because He who created man

159
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:19,762
can also make man return
from the dead, he says!

160
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,157
The Gods might leave us and
give their benefits to another city.

161
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:32,419
Tell him...we will give him
authority, position,

162
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:35,336
and keys to the Kaaba,

163
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,383
and money, what money he wants.

164
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:44,547
Tell him, we will give
him anything he wants.

165
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:14,106
Muhammad, spare yourself
...and me.

166
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:18,632
Do not put a greater burden on
an old man that he can bear.

167
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,697
In your childhood, you were in my arms.

168
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,833
I cannot now see you hurt.

169
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,429
If you refuse them...

170
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:32,946
they will hurt you.

171
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,370
He said this to me:

172
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:54,245
Were they to put the sun in my
right hand and the moon in my left,

173
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:57,742
I would not renounce my message,

174
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,740
which is from God.

175
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,462
When I am dead,
you may do as you please,

176
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,838
but whilst I'm alive,
you will obey your father!

177
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,287
Why did you hurt our father?

178
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,001
If I were drunk every day
and played dice every night,

179
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,509
you'd call it high spirits!

180
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,457
You will be more my
brother than you are now!

181
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,744
You are all my children.

182
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:32,885
I've given you everything I could,

183
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,272
but it seems not to be enough.

184
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,898
Muhammad gives me more,

185
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:42,815
he give all the world more.

186
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,494
Get him out of here, father!

187
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,757
It's not Waleed or me,
it's our father.

188
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,705
You tortured him.

189
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,355
Wait Hudayfa, wait!

190
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,997
How can they say
it's an invention, Musab,

191
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:21,356
when it isn't new?

192
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,773
In Mecca, it's new.

193
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,081
Yet, God has said it all before...

194
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,507
to Noah, Moses, Jesus
to all the Prophets,

195
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:34,502
but people changed it,
turned it, forgot it.

196
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,478
Now God said it to Muhammad again...

197
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:40,915
and it is new again.

198
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,010
What is it?

199
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,349
It's Jafar.

200
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,353
What have you brought with you?

201
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,810
The very word of God.

202
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,838
When the sun is overthrown.

203
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:19,256
When the stars fall.

204
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,173
When the mountains vanish.

205
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,809
When the camels big with
young are abandoned.

206
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,346
When the wild beasts are herded together.

207
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,243
When the seas rise.

208
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,040
When the souls are sorted.

209
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,666
When the female infant
who is buried alive,

210
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,853
asks for what crime she was killed.

211
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,190
When the books are opened.

212
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,646
When the sky is torn away,

213
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:50,385
then...

214
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:52,902
every soul...

215
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,020
will know what it has done.

216
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:02,961
Were you there, Jafar
when God gave him these words?

217
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:18,765
Dawn is coming up.

218
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,884
Ammar, you first,

219
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,462
then you Jaafar.

220
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:30,961
Ammar!

221
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:36,875
You kept your mother awake
all night with worry.

222
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:37,944
I'm sorry father.

223
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:38,913
Where were you?

224
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,051
Have you been with Muhammad again?

225
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,995
What will happen now?

226
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,998
Forgive him, it was
my fault, I did it.

227
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:56,555
That God has helped us all our lives.

228
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:57,664
But it fell...

229
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,151
it could not even help itself.

230
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,647
What talk have you been listening to?

231
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:07,743
The real god is unseen.

232
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,490
He's not made of clay.

233
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:17,873
Ammar, we see the gods
in the Kaaba every day.

234
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:20,391
I'm afraid for you.

235
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,865
You're listening to people
who will hurt you.

236
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:29,042
I'm listening to Muhammad, mother.

237
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,699
Muhammad is generous, yes.

238
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,417
He gives, he shares,

239
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,835
he'll pass no man without a smile,

240
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,471
but he is spreading dangerous ideas.

241
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,078
Dangerous ideas,
that no man should start?

242
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:47,103
That the rich should not afloat the poor?

243
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,140
The strong should not oppress the weak?

244
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,379
Are these dangerous ideas?

245
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,575
Girls should not be forced into marriage,

246
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:56,783
but be able to choose or refuse.

247
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,080
By only tonight, he said;

248
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:03,386
Stop the burial of new-born girls.

249
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:09,031
I was fortunate, always
fortunate with your mother.

250
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,364
Yes, but you know that you and I
nearly never met, Yasser.

251
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,311
And you were nearly never born.

252
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,067
I was to be buried,

253
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,383
like my two sisters,

254
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,409
but my father couldn't do it.

255
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:33,116
He couldn't do it the third time.

256
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,580
When the second girl was being...

257
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:45,284
when my father was putting sand over her,

258
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,038
she took hold of his finger,
the way a baby does.

259
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,614
He told my mother afterwards,

260
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,812
that it was a minute...

261
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,617
before the tender little grip eased...

262
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,583
and he dared take away his hand.

263
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:11,866
When I was born,

264
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,253
my father ran out of the house

265
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,330
screaming that he couldn't do it again,

266
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,448
that he could never do it again.

267
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:25,033
Sumayyah, it is the custom.

268
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:26,911
But it's wrong.

269
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,116
The gods that let such
things be are no gods.

270
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:37,280
I promised to go to Muhammad's
house mama, we pray there.

271
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,807
Yes! He is a good man.

272
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:49,737
Yes...
yes, you go.

273
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,478
Two men are following him.

274
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,814
Read? Muhammad can
neither write nor read.

275
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:13,893
But he can speak.

276
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,160
What did you say?

277
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,068
He can speak?

278
00:27:19,977 --> 00:27:22,964
Well, so can you so now,
you speak up young man.

279
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,222
What does Muhammad say, umm?

280
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:27,869
They are God's words, not his.

281
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:30,596
Which god's?

282
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,492
What words?

283
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,070
A speaking god?

284
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,634
Your Muhammad
speaks only to himself.

285
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,039
When God reveals His
message to Muhammad,

286
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,237
he remembers every word

287
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:49,736
then he tells it to those who can write...

288
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,694
this is the Quran.

289
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:55,330
Muhammad has starved
himself into dreams.

290
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,567
He hides under a blanket
with his eyes shut.

291
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:01,244
His eyes are shut
but his heart is open.

292
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,241
You! Kick him for his cleverness.

293
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,700
There is no purpose in that.

294
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:13,052
Doesn't Muhammad realize, we
live by giving housing to the gods?

295
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,589
We own the Kaaba.

296
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,996
Every year, the tribes of
Arabia come here to Mecca

297
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,904
to pray and to buy from us.

298
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,417
Now, were we to replace
300 Gods with just one?

299
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:31,233
Whom we cannot even see, who is
supposed to be in Taif and Medina,

300
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,772
here in my house,

301
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,850
in Jerusalem, on the moon?

302
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,695
Where would Mecca be then?

303
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:44,750
The gods are both our
worship and our revenue.

304
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,537
You cannot buy and sell God.

305
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:51,114
Young man, you are
close to the whip.

306
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,909
Ammar, be sensible boy.

307
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,327
I have a question.

308
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:01,572
Muhammad teaches you,
a slave is equal to his master.

309
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:07,366
This black Bilal, who I
paid money for...equal to me?

310
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,513
Yes Muhammad says...

311
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:14,239
before God, all men are as
equal as the teeth of a comb.

312
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,765
This is a very pleasant idea
to slaves and beggars.

313
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:20,483
It gives them pretensions.

314
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,141
Bilal!

315
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:30,273
Teach this man the difference
between the Lord of Mecca and a slave.

316
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:31,672
Take that whip.

317
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,825
Lash his face, to
teach his mouth a lesson.

318
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,076
Whip him!

319
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:48,974
Whip him!

320
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:49,983
Cut him!

321
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:56,086
Whip him!

322
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:04,648
Do it Bilal!

323
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:18,403
Obey them!

324
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:20,401
They will kill you!

325
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:27,834
See what anarchy they bring!

326
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,511
They've even infected our slaves!

327
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,127
If you're human enough
to have gods...

328
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,526
...remember!

329
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,524
They are the gods of your owner!

330
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:40,931
I bought your humanity Bilal
when I bought you.

331
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:44,657
You will be corrected!

332
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:00,990
One, one God.

333
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:05,425
There is only one God!

334
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,343
Who is stronger now?

335
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:11,109
Your master
or this one god of yours?

336
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,668
One God.

337
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:17,283
There is only one God.

338
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:18,542
Bring the stones!

339
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,019
One God.

340
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,276
One...

341
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,853
...one God.

342
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:28,952
Crush him!

343
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:37,863
Break him!

344
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:54,065
Have you finished with him?

345
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:57,862
There is only one God!

346
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:01,108
- <i>One God!</i>
- You could swear the slave was preaching!

347
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,616
- <i>One God!</i>
- Lord Umaya!

348
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,776
Abu Bakr will pay a 100
dinars for this slave.

349
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:14,725
Wait now!

350
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:19,220
It's against our social order
to sell a slave during his correction.

351
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,759
The offer is to Lord Umaya!

352
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:23,116
200!

353
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:26,172
If the price of slaves is raised,

354
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,937
we shall have to bail
ourselves next year.

355
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:39,679
Take him!

356
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:41,617
He is no use to me anymore!

357
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:43,475
Kill him or take him,
I'm finished with him!

358
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,708
We are declaring ourselves.

359
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:54,324
God has told his messenger
to declare Islam to all men!

360
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,012
Open the windows!

361
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:57,960
Let the world hear!

362
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,874
We are coming out of the darkness!

363
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:10,507
Hear well the word of God!
Hear well the messenger of God!

364
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:17,020
There are no other gods but God
and Muhammad is his messenger.

365
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:23,674
There are no other gods but God
and Muhammad is his messenger.

366
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,940
We have come into light,

367
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,306
join us in the march to the Kaaba!

368
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:36,281
God is most great,
God is most great!

369
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:39,438
God has no partner!

370
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:41,736
We have come into light,

371
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,562
join us in the march to the Kaaba!

372
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:59,687
Muhammad and his rebellion
called Islam are coming out,

373
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:03,583
to foul our gods
and dethrone religion.

374
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,231
Don't let them reach the Kaaba!

375
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:08,768
Throw them back! Defend your gods!!

376
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:20,396
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

377
00:34:20,696 --> 00:34:25,351
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

378
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:31,104
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

379
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,382
Protect the prophet!

380
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:43,012
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

381
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:53,352
Guards!

382
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:03,452
God is great!

383
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,670
This is blasphemy you idiot!

384
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:08,287
God is great!

385
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,823
God is great!

386
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:13,201
God is great!

387
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,055
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

388
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:49,455
Now's the time to break them,
there are only 30 of them.

389
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,042
No, we've done enough.

390
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,978
More will only create sympathy for them.

391
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:58,195
God is great!

392
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:59,154
<i>Stand down!</i>
God is great!

393
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:14,059
God is great!

394
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:20,433
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

395
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:23,440
Say: O you who reject faith,

396
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,148
I worship not what you worship.

397
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:25,917
<i>Keep him out of the Kaaba!</i>
I worship not what you worship.

398
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,357
<i>Keep him out of the Kaaba!</i>

399
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:26,437
<i>Lead them out!</i>

400
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:27,426
Neither do you worship what i worship.
<i>Lead them out!</i>

401
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:28,065
Neither do you worship what i worship.

402
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:28,475
Silence, you're a false prophet!
Neither do you worship what i worship.

403
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,123
Silence, you're a false prophet!

404
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,442
Finish Muhammad!

405
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:31,981
Protect the prophet!
Finish Muhammad!

406
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,601
Protect the prophet!

407
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,806
Messenger of God,
back to the corner!

408
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:52,659
Hamza! Hamza!

409
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:44,686
You are brave.

410
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,513
He is the bravest man in the desert...

411
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,809
when he meets unarmed men.

412
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,767
Muhammad is...is a liar!

413
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:54,976
Liar?

414
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,592
If you don't let him speak!

415
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,019
Where's the lie and where's the truth...

416
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,137
when it hasn't been spoken yet?

417
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,396
Muhammad is a fraud!

418
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,041
Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!

419
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:20,809
I affirm my nephew's religion
and I say what he says!

420
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:25,734
Whoever has the courage to fight,
fight with me!

421
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:58,311
Muhammad, when I hunt the desert at night...

422
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:04,345
I know God...
is not kept in a house.

423
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:14,055
Who would have thought that Hamza,

424
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:16,313
Hamza above all,

425
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:20,269
with his wine drinking, lion hunting...

426
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:22,286
would come to join Muhammad?

427
00:39:23,604 --> 00:39:27,141
The more we attack him,
more they seem to join him.

428
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,177
Where does he find his words?

429
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,305
I don't know.

430
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:39,219
How can an illiterate man
go up on a mountain

431
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:42,725
and come down three days later,
blazing with poetry?

432
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:45,542
If it were just poetry...

433
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,239
he says it's God.

434
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:56,621
How do we fight someone whose
strength we do not understand?

435
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:00,887
Muhammad promises heaven,
trees in the skies.

436
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:03,244
So naturally he's found an audience.

437
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:06,980
Then we must make that audience
less eager to listen to him.

438
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,486
We will begin with the weaker ones.

439
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,959
Your turn!

440
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,574
Have mercy!

441
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:52,763
Stretch her!

442
00:41:36,388 --> 00:41:38,746
Who is your God?
Answer me!

443
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:40,025
Say it!

444
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,103
Say Hubal is your God!

445
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:42,882
Say it!

446
00:41:42,902 --> 00:41:45,599
There is only one God

447
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:49,316
and Muhammad is the messenger of God!

448
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:29,433
Oh my god!

449
00:43:57,354 --> 00:43:58,004
Ammar!

450
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:03,518
Your father and mother
are the first martyrs of Islam!

451
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,716
You are promised paradise!

452
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:28,452
How much are you men prepared to suffer?

453
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,048
The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.

454
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:35,505
If you stay,

455
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:38,163
they will kill you...

456
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:40,200
one by one.

457
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,407
Muhammad says that in Abyssinia,
there is a Christian King.

458
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,005
No man is wronged in his country.

459
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,547
We must leave now, today.

460
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:29,678
Uthman!

461
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,672
God be praised!

462
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:04,631
Let us go.

463
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,355
We found their tracks
and followed them,

464
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:22,413
but they just disappeared!

465
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:28,106
They were there...
in the desert, under the vultures

466
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:29,865
and you let them escape you!

467
00:48:29,964 --> 00:48:32,042
Escape? They vanished!

468
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:36,038
If Muhammad has stayed,
then only the weakest have gone.

469
00:48:36,178 --> 00:48:38,296
Weak or strong,
they'll blacken our name.

470
00:48:39,255 --> 00:48:41,753
We're honest merchants,
we buy and sell in good faith.

471
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:43,081
We cannot afford scandal.

472
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:47,347
Abyssinia...

473
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:49,025
Amr!

474
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,583
You are a friend of Annajashi, the king?

475
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:52,612
Yes.

476
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:54,330
Can you use that friendship?

477
00:48:57,926 --> 00:48:59,355
I think I can bring them back...

478
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:00,294
yes.

479
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,730
Abyssinia...

480
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:06,837
Rise up Amr.

481
00:49:09,234 --> 00:49:13,420
Please, nothing you may ask
for that we will not give.

482
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,797
Lion of Judah, I...

483
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:19,714
I don't know where to begin.

484
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:23,270
You have our friendship,

485
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:25,068
begin there.

486
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:30,753
Certain runaway slaves have escaped
from us into your kingdom.

487
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:35,977
Slaves go back, as you no doubt
would returned our slaves to us.

488
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:39,164
There are however some
free men among them...

489
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:40,073
rebels.

490
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:42,031
Rebels?

491
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,627
Disturbance in Arabia,
why am I not informed?

492
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,704
They are rebels in religion.

493
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:53,669
At one time or another,
all religions were rebellions.

494
00:49:54,178 --> 00:49:58,124
The bodies of slaves of the world
and beaten are disposal.

495
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,291
But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd,

496
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,188
the souls of men are his sheep.

497
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:08,084
These are Arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers.

498
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:12,460
They follow a lunatic
they call...a Prophet.

499
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:16,376
But I cannot put souls into
chains without hearing them.

500
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:12,917
Good, they're stiff
next we'll hang them.

501
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,058
Do you not bow to yourself
before your prophet?

502
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:23,926
Muhammad is a man,

503
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:26,534
we kneel only to God.

504
00:51:27,263 --> 00:51:29,870
Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?

505
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,186
If he were a prophet,
he'd light the sky with miracles

506
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:35,665
Indeed, this is true.

507
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,691
God has given his prophets
the signs of miracles

508
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,249
that we may recognize them.

509
00:51:41,928 --> 00:51:45,325
The miracle of Muhammad
is the Holy Quran.

510
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:47,792
A book! A book!

511
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:50,879
Written by an illiterate,
attributed to God.

512
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,277
I think the emperor has had enough!

513
00:51:53,496 --> 00:51:55,074
I'm mindful of petty costs.

514
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:59,849
When God set down tongues of fire
upon the heads of Christ's apostles,

515
00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:02,707
so they could speak the
many languages of the world

516
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:03,945
that they knew not before.

517
00:52:05,564 --> 00:52:08,701
But do such miracles happen in our times?

518
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,894
I've heard enough!
You've made a poor case.

519
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,742
When we suffered persecution in Mecca,

520
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:28,760
Muhammad told us,
go to Abyssinia,

521
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,378
the land of the righteous king,
where no man is wronged!

522
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:34,665
What they call persecution
was fair punishment,

523
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:35,822
that is order, now...

524
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:37,411
Why did your prophet send you to me?

525
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:40,498
Because you believe in the book
of the one God as we do.

526
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:43,864
He sent us because in your heart,
God will protect us.

527
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:46,961
Talking with him is like
drawing water from a mirage.

528
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:50,578
But they've now belay that duty on
me to listen to them, my friend.

529
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:00,108
Go on!

530
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:08,979
For years, we worshiped
wood and stone,

531
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,367
images of our own manufacture.

532
00:53:12,036 --> 00:53:13,854
We lived in ignorance of God.

533
00:53:14,614 --> 00:53:18,149
We had few earthly laws
and no heavenly laws.

534
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:20,367
The rich neglect the poor.

535
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:22,185
And the natural pity of man,

536
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:24,603
whereby he lifts his brother
up when he has fallen...

537
00:53:25,062 --> 00:53:28,599
is described by them as
upsetting social order!

538
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:35,432
To this inhumanity,
has come a man...

539
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:37,889
whom God chose...

540
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,626
and in that we believe.

541
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,338
You've overcome, I beg
you to collect yourself.

542
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,394
I speak of the messenger of God.

543
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:58,907
Muhammad teaches us
to worship one god,

544
00:53:59,866 --> 00:54:01,145
to speak truth,

545
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:04,382
to love our neighbors as ourselves,

546
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:08,318
to give charity,
even a smile can be charity.

547
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:12,474
To protect women from misuse,

548
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:14,931
to shelter orphans...

549
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,507
and to turn away from
gods of wood and stone!

550
00:54:19,586 --> 00:54:22,763
I cannot keep still and
hear this blasphemy!

551
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,620
We are an ancient civilization...

552
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,056
to call our gods wood and stone
is to speak ignorantly of them.

553
00:54:31,115 --> 00:54:33,253
The idol...the form,
is not what we worship,

554
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:36,370
but the spirit that resides within the form.

555
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,783
I agree that idolatry is not
always fully understood.

556
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:44,341
Thank you.

557
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:49,016
Now let me bring him back to the women.

558
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:54,051
God made woman to be the
proper companion of man.

559
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:56,169
She is different but equal.

560
00:54:56,189 --> 00:54:57,148
Equal?!

561
00:54:57,887 --> 00:54:59,226
We buy them.

562
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:01,384
Feed them, clothe them,

563
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:03,761
use them, discard them...

564
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:05,939
women equal to us?

565
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:15,549
God created man from
one male and one female.

566
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:20,904
Amr, you must respect in all
woman the womb that bore you.

567
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:25,538
Why are your 300
guards so tongue-tied?

568
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:28,316
While this only guard is eloquent.

569
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:32,551
God has spoken to us before...

570
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:36,567
through Abraham, Noah, Moses
and through Jesus Christ.

571
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:40,843
Why should we be so surprised that God
speaks to us now through Muhammad?

572
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:42,262
Who taught you those names?

573
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:44,320
They are named in the Quran.

574
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:48,535
I knew Muhammad when he
was an orphan minding sheep!

575
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:51,353
And we knew Christ as a carpenter.

576
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:57,247
What Christ says
and what your Muhammad says

577
00:55:57,766 --> 00:56:00,583
is like two raised from the same land.

578
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:03,301
They are lying to you,
they deny Christ.

579
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:07,495
You worship three gods, they say.
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, they say.

580
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:10,592
What do you say of Christ?

581
00:56:10,672 --> 00:56:12,750
They say God cannot have a son.

582
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,808
Christ is not the Son of God.

583
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:16,926
Speak to me of Christ.

584
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:22,960
We say of Christ what
our prophet has taught us...

585
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:27,406
that God cast his holy spirit into
the womb of a virgin named, Mary

586
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:30,153
and that she conceived
Christ, the Apostle of God.

587
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:32,510
The Apostle he says,
not the son, not the son!

588
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:38,604
What does your miracle, your Quran,
say of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?

589
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:41,641
May I relate the words?

590
00:56:45,797 --> 00:56:46,775
Come closer to me.

591
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,405
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

592
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:02,959
Relate in the book, the story of Mary.

593
00:57:04,398 --> 00:57:07,235
How she withdrew from her
family to a place in the east.

594
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:10,931
How we sent to her our
angel, Gabriel, who said:

595
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,088
''I am a messenger from your God"

596
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:17,644
"to announce the birth
of a holy son to you."

597
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:23,039
She said: "How shall I, Mary, have a son
when no man has touched me?''

598
00:57:24,877 --> 00:57:26,415
And Gabriel replied:

599
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,850
"For your Lord says, it will happen."

600
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:34,386
We appoint him as a sign onto man...

601
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,884
and a mercy from us.

602
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:41,559
It is a thing ordained.

603
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:12,567
The difference between us and you,

604
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:18,102
is not bigger than this line.

605
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,653
Not for a mountain of gold
will I give them up to you.

606
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:34,885
You may live in Abyssinia, in peace,

607
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,123
for as long as you wish.

608
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,459
May God's blessings be upon you,

609
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:41,858
when you return.

610
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:50,889
lntolerable!

611
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:54,604
Mohamed disturbs even
our foreign alliances!

612
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:57,002
Very well!

613
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:59,619
We will make a foreigner of him!

614
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:02,396
Abu Talib,

615
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:05,054
has his arms around him.

616
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:06,992
Very well!

617
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:10,548
We will throw uncle
and nephew out.

618
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,203
In one bundle, his whole family out.

619
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:19,399
We will expel them from ourselves.

620
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:21,917
No merchant may trade with them.

621
00:59:22,496 --> 00:59:24,235
No land remain to them.

622
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,253
No roof shelter them.

623
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:28,231
No beggar beg for them.

624
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:29,509
No woman marry them.

625
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:32,686
Until they renounce, they can't.

626
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,154
<i>These were the worst
years of Muhammad's life.</i>

627
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:30,526
<i>For three years they suffered the hunger,
thirst, cruelty of the open desert.</i>

628
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:35,401
<i>But the year of grief was still to come,</i>

629
01:00:36,021 --> 01:00:40,137
<i>when Khadija, Muhammad's
wife for 24 years, died.</i>

630
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:44,472
<i>When Abu Talib,
his old Protector, died...</i>

631
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:48,069
<i>with his last breath, Abu Talib,</i>

632
01:00:48,169 --> 01:00:51,765
<i>tried again to reconcile
Mecca and Muhammad.</i>

633
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:55,181
He never asked more from you...

634
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,457
...than one word.

635
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:01,155
One...

636
01:01:03,332 --> 01:01:04,571
one God.

637
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:08,627
If it were only a question of one word,
we would have given him ten words.

638
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:13,282
But the word he wants,
would dethrone all the gods.

639
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:40,374
You were afraid even to hear him.

640
01:02:00,494 --> 01:02:04,970
<i>With the death of his uncle,
Muhammad has now lost all protection.</i>

641
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:07,727
<i>He was no longer safe in Mecca.</i>

642
01:02:09,485 --> 01:02:14,500
<i>Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,
he went to the hillside town of Taif.</i>

643
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,057
<i>He asked to be taken in,
to be allowed to preach.</i>

644
01:02:20,893 --> 01:02:23,350
<i>But the children of
Taif were turned loose,</i>

645
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,348
<i>to stone him back into the desert.</i>

646
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:28,565
What are you doing?!

647
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:32,181
Stop! Stop!

648
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:36,597
Leave him alone! Go away!

649
01:02:51,382 --> 01:02:54,659
<i>Muhammad called this,
the bitterest day of his life.</i>

650
01:02:56,677 --> 01:02:58,635
<i>Then miraculously,</i>

651
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:01,572
<i>when Muhammad's mission
seemed to have failed,</i>

652
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:04,088
<i>his entire situation changed.</i>

653
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:08,804
<i>A deputation from the rich,
but self-destroying city of Medina,</i>

654
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,561
<i>met him by night at
the rocks of Aqaba,</i>

655
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,019
<i>asking him to come to them,</i>

656
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:16,076
<i>to stand between their factions,</i>

657
01:03:16,156 --> 01:03:20,092
<i>to mediate their continual
quarrels and civil wars.</i>

658
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:22,350
<i>Muhammad agreed...</i>

659
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,898
<i>provided they gave him a pledge</i>

660
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,705
<i>that they worship the one God only.</i>

661
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:28,704
Wait!

662
01:03:30,462 --> 01:03:33,959
When we take this pledge we expel
ourselves from the rest of Arabia.

663
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,217
So, wait!

664
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:40,552
War is in this pledge.

665
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,369
We are to make
enemies of brothers.

666
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,786
We are to make
firewood of our gods!

667
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:48,263
That is the meaning of the pledge.

668
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:51,460
If we take it, there can
be no turning back...

669
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:55,396
for Muhammad is indeed
the messenger of God,

670
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:57,874
foretold to us by
the Jews in our city.

671
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:02,029
So if anyone has doubt
in this pledge, go now.

672
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:06,745
And if you have no doubts,
then you do as I do.

673
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:13,198
I pledge myself to
the one and only God,

674
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:16,355
and to you Muhammad,
the messenger of God.

675
01:04:17,614 --> 01:04:20,951
He is of us and we are of him.

676
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:28,961
Let him bring his followers,
our brothers, to us, to Medina.

689

Muhammad has become a nation,

01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,649
he has received a city,

691
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:22,006
entering into pledges and treaties

692
01:06:22,306 --> 01:06:25,183
and you, Salool, who claim
to be king of Medina

lost the kingdom last night
while you were in bed!

694
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,998
You should worry about
yourself, Abu Sufian.

695
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:33,953
Every time you trade a
whiff of perfume out the city,

696
01:06:33,963 --> 01:06:36,411
you must creep past
that man in Medina.

697
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,206
He is across your
mercantile throat so to speak.

698
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:42,685
And what do you intend to do?

699
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,102
l intend to wait.

700
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:46,541
And how long will you wait?

701
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:49,038
Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him,

702
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:52,415
to save your way of life.

703
01:06:52,515 --> 01:06:53,654
And while you wait?

704
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,491
I should accept his call of course.

705
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,548
Does he think I will
give him my birthright?

706
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:01,905
I will not.

707
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,222
Medina is worth the conversion.

708
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:06,341
Hypocrisy.

709
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:10,377
Of course it's...a healthy hypocrisy.

710
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:12,475
King Salool,

711
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:15,870
wiping his face on the floor
5 times a day praying?

01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,429
I don't believe you.

713
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:19,447
He may not have to.

714
01:07:20,706 --> 01:07:22,724
We'll do know what we
should have done before:

715
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:24,722
kill Muhammad.

716
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,098
Come, come and see.

717
01:07:28,398 --> 01:07:30,855
They say that practice
leads to perfection.

718
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:44,981
7 young men each
from a different family,

719
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,740
my own son Ikrima is with them.

720
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:50,755
They will stab him together.

721
01:07:56,988 --> 01:08:01,584
If the responsibility for his death
is shared, where lies the guilt?

722
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:03,981
My idea.

723
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:09,216
I'm not sure I'm part of it.

724
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,832
Muhammad's body contains too much...

725
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:17,408
his mind, his words...

726
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:21,044
But it is an ingenious solution.

727
01:08:21,843 --> 01:08:23,062
And a final one.

728
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:35,058
No!

729
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,923
Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?

730
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,539
Who are we fighting?

731
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:50,632
They cannot go far, all
the tracks are watched.

732
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,950
He must take to the desert.

733
01:09:55,448 --> 01:09:58,205
Bakkah will give
100 camels to the man

734
01:09:58,215 --> 01:09:59,324
who brings back Muhammad...

735
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:00,841
...or his head!

736
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,938
Look for 3 of them:

737
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,337
Muhammad,

738
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:07,075
Abu Bakr,

739
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:09,073
and Uriqat, his Bedouin guide.

740
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:30,492
What is it?

741
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,530
They're not grazing camel.

742
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,944
Maybe two days, that from the city.

743
01:10:44,876 --> 01:10:45,775
Why are you here?

744
01:10:46,654 --> 01:10:47,893
Medina is to the north.

745
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:51,350
They make the tracks, not I.

746
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:54,027
Nomads? Travelling west?

747
01:10:54,806 --> 01:10:56,005
I know my art.

748
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,382
They say that you can track
a bird by smelling the air.

749
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:03,538
We go with them.

750
01:11:19,701 --> 01:11:22,059
He may be in that cave over there.

751
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:31,648
Muhammad, if you come out,
we will take you to Mecca alive.

752
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:46,593
Muhammad, come out!

753
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:57,862
They can't be in there,
this...this web is unbroken.

754
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:00,420
And these pigeons,
they would not build.

755
01:12:01,778 --> 01:12:03,596
We were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north.

756
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:04,695
Let's move then.

757
01:12:05,115 --> 01:12:06,812
We still have time to head them off.

01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,128
No, nothing.

767
01:13:31,805 --> 01:13:33,603
He himself says he is only a man.

768
01:13:35,382 --> 01:13:37,100
No man can survive that heat.

769

- There! I see them!
- Look!

770
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:44,351
Run and hide.

771
01:14:45,171 --> 01:14:47,169
I may be obliged
to free you as a gesture.

772
01:15:57,516 --> 01:16:00,493
Welcome to the city
of Medina, the blessed.

773
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:03,091
Your city, messenger of God.

774
01:16:14,459 --> 01:16:16,476
You will stay with me,
messenger of God.

775
01:16:17,136 --> 01:16:18,674
I have the best house in Medina.

776
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:21,212
You will give me the
honor of keeping you.

777
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:22,510
Stay with me!

778
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:27,685
Please! Please! Please!

779
01:16:27,975 --> 01:16:31,341
How can the Prophet choose
between so many welcomes?

780
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:36,856
Where God guides his camel to stop,
there he will build his house.

781
01:16:36,866 --> 01:16:37,935
All agreed?

782
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:40,692
We turn Quaswa, his camel loose

783
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:44,428
and where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays.

784
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:58,553
Clever man.

785
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:02,329
A choice made by a
camel can offend no one.

786
01:18:25,924 --> 01:18:27,942
Here we will build
the house of the Prophet.

787
01:18:30,299 --> 01:18:33,496
And our first meeting
place, a prayer house!

788
01:18:35,094 --> 01:18:37,772
The first mosque of Islam, here!

789
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:43,027
God is great! God is great!

790
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:21,207
What is the prophet of God doing?

791
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,205
Carrying bricks?

792
01:19:24,184 --> 01:19:25,243
Give me that.

793
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:28,160
Look, you are doing too much.

794
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:32,716
Please, go and sit down
...we'll do it.

795
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:48,239
Look! He went for more.

796
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,296
"Work is a worship" he says.

797
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,634
He's 53 years old.

798
01:19:55,192 --> 01:19:56,131
How old are you?

799
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:48,257
There is something missing.

800
01:21:49,316 --> 01:21:51,253
Maybe a bell to call the people in.

801
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,150
- The Christians use a bell?
- Mmm (yes).

802
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:58,006
What about a horn, like the Jews?

803
01:21:58,586 --> 01:21:59,365
A drum?

804
01:22:02,262 --> 01:22:04,120
There's too much blood in a drum.

805
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,318
Why not the human voice...

806
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,316
as in Umar ibn Khattab's vision?

807
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,174
The Prophet agrees?

808
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,109
He means you, Bilal.

809
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:17,627
Me?

810
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,485
You have a good voice, use it.

811
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:21,483
Climb up there.

812
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:00,361
Brothers!

813
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:06,655
Today, a man of Medina,

814
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:08,912
will embrace a man of Mecca.

815
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:11,430
Each will share half and half.

816
01:24:13,408 --> 01:24:18,383
Reach out, embrace your
neighbor and brother.

817
01:24:37,523 --> 01:24:40,959
I'm tired of the politics of
kissing slaves, read this!

818
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:44,536
The prophet should concern
himself with the after-world.

819
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,029
How is my son?

820
01:24:52,248 --> 01:24:53,866
Praying like a horse.

821
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:01,219
Does it burn your hands?

822
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:04,835
If it's not torn up,
it will burn down the house.

823
01:25:05,055 --> 01:25:06,733
He's making laws like a king.

824
01:25:08,132 --> 01:25:12,148
He has declared that loyalty to Islam
is more than loyalty to tribal family.

825
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:13,766
What?

826
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:16,943
All muslims are next of kin to one-another?

827
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:18,881
Don't be mislead by that.

828
01:25:19,061 --> 01:25:21,638
They must change the
nature of the tribes before that.

829
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:25,154
The danger is here, equality:

830
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:28,111
a man's neighbour is as good as himself.

831
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:29,510
The lunatic means it!

832
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:32,986
Jews and Christians have
equal rights with Muslims.

833
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:37,542
The Jews who attach themselves to a
common wealth shall be protected.

834
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:42,037
- Women have rights of inheritance?
- Rights.

835
01:25:42,457 --> 01:25:44,305
Next, he'll be giving the camel rights.

836
01:25:44,315 --> 01:25:47,372
He has! The lunatic has!
You can't overload them.

837
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:53,466
He's remaking a city, my city!

838
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:56,503
Damn him!

839
01:25:58,001 --> 01:26:02,695
He's taken our sons from us,
our future from us.

840
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:08,989
His rights... are wrongs!

841
01:26:09,928 --> 01:26:10,807
No more.

842
01:26:14,484 --> 01:26:18,739
This time... it will
not be just his riffraff.

843
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:23,415
We will take everything of
value they have left in Mecca.

844
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:27,491
Their rugs, their houses, their silver...

845
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:32,426
and with it, a large of caravan to Damascus.

846
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:06,710
My friends, listen to me!

847
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,667
I have news from Mecca!

848
01:27:13,224 --> 01:27:15,422
Everything you have left behind is gone!

849
01:27:15,881 --> 01:27:16,980
The thieves!

850
01:27:18,219 --> 01:27:21,356
Abu Bakr's shops,
the prophet's house... sold!

851
01:27:22,714 --> 01:27:24,293
Every cup or piece of cloth,

852
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:27,988
every rag or bone you ever
owned is thrown on the market.

853
01:27:29,487 --> 01:27:30,805
You are a people of nothing.

854
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,940
Don't you even fight for what you own?

855
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,738
Who talks of the fight?

856
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:42,733
What other way is there, Hamza?

857
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:47,828
When the Prophet
says fight, we fight.

858
01:27:48,308 --> 01:27:50,166
Now he says, peace.

859
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:51,764
Exactly!

860
01:27:51,824 --> 01:27:53,562
You are a peace loving people!

861
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:57,299
Up to your necks and fore-bearers.

862
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:05,810
Go back to work.

863
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:22,453
We have to defend ourselves.

864
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:26,109
You are the messenger of God.

865
01:28:26,728 --> 01:28:28,107
Yet, they mock...

866
01:28:28,746 --> 01:28:31,304
abuse and plunder us
and we do nothing.

867
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:35,380
In the package of war, we are pathetic!

868
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:38,077
But they are led by greed.

869
01:28:39,475 --> 01:28:42,213
We are led by God
...and you.

870
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:45,010
Now I...

871
01:28:46,429 --> 01:28:48,206
I know how you hate the sword,

872
01:28:50,204 --> 01:28:52,002
but we have to fight.

873
01:29:00,493 --> 01:29:01,992
They have stolen our property.

874
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:07,546
They are taking it to Damascus,
right past our own door.

875
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:11,742
I say by God, get back!

876
01:29:35,447 --> 01:29:36,736
I'm sorry I'm carried away.

877
01:29:39,513 --> 01:29:41,212
It's the pounding in my head.

878
01:29:44,528 --> 01:29:48,624
Please... fight them!

879
01:30:29,422 --> 01:30:31,660
But... look at the sun.

880
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:42,210
It's not the time for prayer.

881
01:31:07,164 --> 01:31:11,300
It is newly revealed
by God to his messenger.

882
01:31:14,356 --> 01:31:18,632
Fight, but fight in the way of God,
against those who fight against you.

883
01:31:19,551 --> 01:31:22,009
Drive them out of the places
where they drove you out,

884
01:31:22,628 --> 01:31:24,926
for persecution is worse than slaughter.

885
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:29,062
Fight them until persecution is no more

886
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:31,040
and religion is for God.

887
01:31:32,638 --> 01:31:33,597
But if they stop,

888
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:36,313
let there be no more war...

889
01:31:37,432 --> 01:31:40,709
for God never loves
the starter of wars.

890
01:31:41,428 --> 01:31:43,826
So, fight in the way of God

891
01:31:44,226 --> 01:31:46,283
against those who fight against you!

892
01:31:47,542 --> 01:31:51,698
- God is great!
- God is great!! God is great!!

893
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:54,855
- God is great!
- God is great!!

894
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:41,108
These are the disciplines
the Prophet puts upon you.

895
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:48,101
You may not harm a woman,
a child or any old person!

896
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:51,557
You may not harm cripples!

897
01:32:52,696 --> 01:32:55,913
You may not harm the
man that works in the field!

898
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:59,488
You may not cut down trees!

899
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:04,024
Strike only at those who have expelled you!

900
01:33:04,323 --> 01:33:09,059
Who have stolen your rights and
riched themselves with your possessions!

901
01:33:15,093 --> 01:33:19,049
Now, to the wells of Badr!

902
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,617
News from Medina!

903
01:33:31,536 --> 01:33:36,251
Arm... arm yourselves!
Arm yourselves!

904
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,449
Defend your wealth!

905
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:42,984
Muhammad has come out of Medina
to attack the great caravan!

906
01:33:43,124 --> 01:33:46,300
- How many men?
- Three hundred, two horses.

907
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,937
We man a 100 horses.
How many camels?

908
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:53,094
- Seventy.
- We'll bring a hundred and seventy!

909
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:56,170
And load twenty of my camels
with wine, we'll make a feast of it.

910
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:58,388
This is a war I'd like to fight,

911
01:33:58,448 --> 01:34:00,306
a war we cannot lose!

912
01:34:44,621 --> 01:34:48,078
Ride to Abu Sofyan's caravan,
tell him to turn towards Badr.

913
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:51,224
We will join our forces
tomorrow at the wells of Badr.

914
01:35:50,273 --> 01:35:52,711
The wells of Badr, here.

915
01:35:54,029 --> 01:35:56,487
Muhammad's march, here.

916
01:35:58,305 --> 01:36:01,262
My charge of the caravan, here.

917
01:36:01,702 --> 01:36:03,640
One day's march...

918
01:36:06,197 --> 01:36:07,576
meet them at the wells.

919
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:14,189
I don't like it.

920
01:36:16,827 --> 01:36:19,904
There is too much of Mecca
in my caravan to be risked.

921
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,036
Put out the fires!
Hold the camels!

922
01:36:37,485 --> 01:36:41,031
We are turning west,
away from the wells.

923
01:36:41,741 --> 01:36:45,117
Away?
You can't!

924
01:36:46,216 --> 01:36:48,034
You must meet them at Badr.

925
01:36:48,434 --> 01:36:51,291
We can drink them down like raw eggs.

926
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:55,607
If I run all night, I'll be out of
Muhammad's reach by morning.

927
01:36:55,807 --> 01:36:57,825
Where is your honor, Abu Sofyan?!

928
01:36:59,343 --> 01:37:00,122
Honor?

929
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:03,978
My honor is on the
backs of my camels.

930
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:05,437
Yes, I run...

931
01:38:57,442 --> 01:39:00,319
Muhammad has occupied the wells!

932
01:39:01,758 --> 01:39:04,635
He has moved directly
into our line of march.

933
01:39:25,473 --> 01:39:29,089
Abu Sofyan has broken camp.
He's moving west, away from Badr.

934
01:39:29,828 --> 01:39:31,127
The caravan is safe.

935
01:39:32,106 --> 01:39:33,804
So, there is no need to fight.

936
01:39:34,364 --> 01:39:35,143
Not fight?

937
01:39:35,423 --> 01:39:39,019
If we fight, we will start
blood feuds between brothers.

938
01:39:39,998 --> 01:39:41,816
Between father and son, you mean.

939
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:45,773
Hudayfa, your own son is with them,
he should have been whipped.

940
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,128
Mecca is greater than your family!

941
01:39:52,925 --> 01:39:55,473
Waleed, your second son,
he is your true blood.

942
01:39:55,822 --> 01:39:56,880
I say: fight!

943
01:39:57,620 --> 01:40:01,236
We stand in the present
let the future look after itself.

944
01:40:06,671 --> 01:40:09,228
Otba is not a coward.

945
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:15,602
We finish them tomorrow.

946
01:40:15,981 --> 01:40:18,319
- We fight!
- We fight!!!

947
01:40:57,599 --> 01:40:58,678
Are you finished?!

948
01:41:52,643 --> 01:41:55,819
Form ranks, battle positions!

949
01:41:58,337 --> 01:42:01,134
Each man to his own place!

950
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:13,919
Go back to your columns!

951
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:15,877
Move away... move back!

952
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,508
So Muhammad's filled the wells.

953
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:29,992
Now everyone brought here
will have to fight, for theirs.

954
01:43:30,262 --> 01:43:31,740
Good, we fight!

955
01:43:44,008 --> 01:43:46,765
Brothers, we hold the wells.

956
01:43:47,045 --> 01:43:49,982
We stand in the name of
God and his messenger.

957
01:43:50,462 --> 01:43:51,321
We wait.

958
01:44:43,907 --> 01:44:45,965
Send us your champions!

959
01:44:46,844 --> 01:44:52,438
(BATTLE OF BADR)

960
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:00,689
Who are you?!

961
01:45:01,269 --> 01:45:05,025
We expect our peers
and our equals!

962
01:45:08,002 --> 01:45:08,661
Come back!

963
01:45:14,535 --> 01:45:16,633
My brother, Shaiba!

964
01:45:18,252 --> 01:45:20,010
My son, Waleed!

965
01:45:21,109 --> 01:45:22,388
And myself!

966
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:29,780
Not you.

967
01:45:33,615 --> 01:45:35,553
Ubaida and I...

968
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:37,911
and Ali.

969
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:38,270
Are we your equals?

970
01:46:39,388 --> 01:46:40,927
There is only one God

971
01:46:41,726 --> 01:46:43,524
and Muhammad is His messenger.

972
01:48:19,365 --> 01:48:21,633
Archers! Advance!

973
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:26,278
Archers!

974
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:32,972
Hold...

975
01:48:37,168 --> 01:48:38,047
stretch!

976
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:49,975
Stretch!

977
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:02,641
Stretch!

978
01:49:17,816 --> 01:49:18,985
Archers!

979

Archers back!

980
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:46,296
They are regrouping.

01:49:46,756 --> 01:49:48,674
Forward!!

982
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:54,049
Ready!

983
01:49:55,277 --> 01:49:56,286
Lancers!

984
01:50:15,867 --> 01:50:17,285
God is great!

985
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,098
Archers!

986
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:26,895
God is great! God is great!

Umaya!

988

Bilal!

990
01:51:56,303 --> 01:51:57,722
God is great!

991
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:20,039
Onward to victory!

992
01:52:49,689 --> 01:53:13,124
God is great!

993
01:53:18,939 --> 01:53:20,337
The Prophet has seen you!

994
01:53:21,096 --> 01:53:23,614
You are not to rope
or drag the prisoners!

995
01:53:24,033 --> 01:53:26,931
- They would've roped us!
- Cut them loose!

996
01:53:28,789 --> 01:53:30,367
I said, cut them loose!

997
01:53:32,245 --> 01:53:33,404
And give them water

998
01:53:34,483 --> 01:53:38,399
And share your food,
equal mouth-fulls.

999
01:53:39,058 --> 01:53:41,356
And if they walk, walk beside them.

1000
01:53:43,534 --> 01:53:49,987
Any prisoner who can teach
10 Muslims to read... will go free.

1001
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:20,816
Why don't they go away?

1002
01:54:20,895 --> 01:54:24,412
Because, they blame me Hind,
for whatever reason, good or bad.

1003
01:54:25,351 --> 01:54:28,548
I should have joined them and
drown at the wells of Badr with them...

1004
01:54:28,868 --> 01:54:31,405
but I saved the caravan
and our future with it.

1005
01:54:33,962 --> 01:54:35,520
Why sing at me!

1006
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:39,456
Why sing my father and
my brother as it's not me?!

1007
01:54:40,894 --> 01:54:42,892
Do you think I
need you to remind me?

1008
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:50,425
Muhammad, Ali, Hamza!

1009
01:54:57,518 --> 01:54:59,276
With my nails, Hamza,

1010
01:55:00,515 --> 01:55:05,230
I will give you measure for
measure, with my nails...

1011
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:12,023
killer, cut throat, butcher!

1012
01:55:13,162 --> 01:55:14,821
Murdering beast!

1013
01:55:16,378 --> 01:55:18,855
You slaughtered my father!

1014
01:55:19,874 --> 01:55:20,494
Hamza!

1015
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:27,767
I will hunt... a lion hunter!

1016
01:55:29,205 --> 01:55:33,820
I will make Hamza,
a running lion, my prey.

1017
01:55:35,079 --> 01:55:39,175
And when you are dead Hamza,
I will cut your heart out,

1018
01:55:40,234 --> 01:55:44,610
taste your blood,
cut you into pieces!

1019
01:55:45,249 --> 01:55:48,386
I forbit this wailing.
it cannot go on.

1020
01:55:49,685 --> 01:55:51,583
What we should do, we will do.

1021
01:55:52,642 --> 01:55:56,318
We will call in our allies,
raise a new army against them.

1022
01:55:57,077 --> 01:56:01,032
This time, we will
prepare it and plan it.

1023
01:56:06,127 --> 01:56:07,386
Hamza!

1024
01:56:16,976 --> 01:56:20,872
Come to prayer!

1025
01:56:24,129 --> 01:56:27,805
Come to prayer!

1026
01:56:30,363 --> 01:56:33,859
Come to victory!

1027
01:56:35,618 --> 01:56:39,214
Come to victory!

1028
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:45,407
God is great!

1029
01:56:50,801 --> 01:56:55,896
There is no god, but God!

1030
01:57:37,973 --> 01:57:38,952
Is it a plague?

1031
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:44,627
What kind of an upside down
town have we come in to?

1032
01:57:48,303 --> 01:57:51,300
You could fill your
pockets very nicely here.

1033
01:57:53,138 --> 01:57:55,596
No merchant is minding his shop.

1034
01:57:56,355 --> 01:57:57,793
God is minding the shop.

1035
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:03,048
- Where do you come from?
- Yemen.

1036
01:58:04,606 --> 01:58:05,724
Did you stop in Mecca?

1037
01:58:08,042 --> 01:58:09,201
It is on the road.

1038
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,858
You didn't answer my question,

1039
01:58:12,598 --> 01:58:14,076
did you stop in Mecca?

1040
01:58:15,415 --> 01:58:17,453
Long enough to rest my camels.

1041
01:58:18,452 --> 01:58:21,189
Camels rest better in Mecca
than anywhere in the world.

1042
01:58:21,489 --> 01:58:22,248
Yes.

1043
01:58:23,966 --> 01:58:25,405
What is the word on the desert?

1044
01:58:25,704 --> 01:58:29,101
Oh... it is bad for you.

1045
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,459
They are gathering..

1046
01:58:32,598 --> 01:58:35,575
every young man with a
sword is on his way to Mecca.

1047
01:58:37,672 --> 01:58:39,531
Our strength is here.

1048
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,948
Do not underestimate them.

1049
01:58:42,827 --> 01:58:44,805
They are summoning up their courage.

1050
01:58:46,163 --> 01:58:49,120
In Mecca there is music in every house.

1051
01:59:59,349 --> 02:00:03,505
An Abyssinian slave, watch him.
He is good, he is vicious, watch him

1052
02:01:23,822 --> 02:01:24,801
I will free you,

1053
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,658
give you your weight in silver,

1054
02:01:28,218 --> 02:01:29,596
and your height in silk,

1055
02:01:31,754 --> 02:01:33,671
for one throw like this.

1056
02:01:53,072 --> 02:01:54,850
So they have come at last.

1057
02:01:57,088 --> 02:01:58,586
We'll know how many soon enough.

1058
02:02:16,907 --> 02:02:18,356
It's a big army.

1059
02:02:18,585 --> 02:02:21,782
Three thousand men,
hundreds of horses.

1060
02:02:22,202 --> 02:02:23,381
We beat them at Badr.

1061
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:24,619
That was a year ago.

1062
02:02:25,518 --> 02:02:27,496
They have come to revenge Badr.

1063
02:02:29,614 --> 02:02:31,193
Go home and get your swords.

1064
02:02:59,304 --> 02:03:01,142
Soldiers of Mecca!

1065
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,958
Blood master blood!

1066
02:03:05,697 --> 02:03:08,734
Avenge the dead of Badr!

1067

(BATTLE OF UHUD)

1068
02:03:29,074 --> 02:03:31,451
There, Hamza, can you see him?

1069
02:03:37,604 --> 02:03:38,783
He is your fortune.

1070
02:03:43,698 --> 02:03:44,437
Ubada!

1071
02:03:46,036 --> 02:03:48,254
Those horsemen on the flank out there,

1072
02:03:50,112 --> 02:03:51,211
they're oddly placed.

1073
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:54,068
- They are under Khalid.
- Khalid?

1074
02:03:55,526 --> 02:03:57,444
I often thought of that young man.

1075
02:03:58,883 --> 02:03:59,562
Hamza!

1076
02:04:00,022 --> 02:04:00,621
Yes?

1077
02:04:02,299 --> 02:04:04,657
The Prophet asks if you
have noticed those horsemen?

1078
02:04:04,857 --> 02:04:05,776
Yes I have.

1079
02:04:06,735 --> 02:04:07,774
I don't like them.

1080
02:04:08,154 --> 02:04:09,992
He's sending out 50
archers to watch them.

1081
02:04:10,971 --> 02:04:15,286
No matter what happens,
the archers must hold off those horsemen.

1082
02:04:28,432 --> 02:04:31,789
Zaid, tell the Prophet we are ready.

1083
02:04:33,927 --> 02:04:35,166
What do you think, Hamza?

1084
02:04:37,044 --> 02:04:41,379
Well they outnumber us,
so I'd say it's a fair fight.

1085
02:04:42,618 --> 02:04:45,915
We see them
and they see us.

1086
02:04:47,194 --> 02:04:49,551
What faces me has never frightened me.

1087
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:56,065
- All praise be to Hubal!
- Hubal!!

1088
02:05:06,553 --> 02:05:08,192
When Muhammad gives the word...

1089
02:05:11,348 --> 02:05:12,687
we will go to them.

1090
02:05:42,797 --> 02:05:43,735
Hamza!

1091
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,850
Weapons ready!

1092
02:05:52,866 --> 02:05:57,022
We march... now!

1093
02:06:01,038 --> 02:06:02,476
Attack!!

1094
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:07,128
They've killed Hamza!

1095
02:08:07,228 --> 02:08:08,147
On to them!

1096
02:08:24,231 --> 02:08:26,969
You, take this! Fight back!

1097
02:08:27,788 --> 02:08:28,967
Where are you going?!

1098
02:08:29,306 --> 02:08:30,964
Fight! Fight!

1099
02:08:31,143 --> 02:08:33,141
Fight back!

1100
02:08:45,909 --> 02:08:47,467
This is a moment of victory!

1101
02:08:47,527 --> 02:08:50,014
They're running away
from us, let's get the loot!

1102
02:08:50,024 --> 02:08:51,763
Stand where you are told to stand!

1103
02:08:53,701 --> 02:08:55,229
Come back to your positions!

1104
02:08:55,239 --> 02:08:56,598
All of you, come back!

1105
02:08:57,717 --> 02:08:58,596
It's a road!

1106
02:08:59,075 --> 02:09:00,494
Our centre is gone!

1107
02:09:00,774 --> 02:09:02,252
We've lost the battle, Khalid!

1108
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,849
Not yet.

1109
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,949
Hold on!

1110
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:53,358
Where is the prophet?

1111
02:10:53,378 --> 02:10:55,236
Muhammad is dead,
I saw him fall!

1112
02:10:56,155 --> 02:10:59,652
No, no! He's alive! Find him!

1113
02:11:21,149 --> 02:11:24,486
Back, back to the mountains!

1114
02:12:04,745 --> 02:12:05,644
Halt!

1115
02:12:27,781 --> 02:12:29,260
I thought we were beaten!

1116
02:12:29,879 --> 02:12:31,338
Now, victory is yours, Khalid.

1117
02:12:31,538 --> 02:12:33,736
We have no victory until
we have finished Muhammad.

1118
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:35,614
He is up in those rocks.

1119
02:12:35,893 --> 02:12:39,750
We have finished our business,
we have avenged Badr.

1120
02:12:40,049 --> 02:12:41,866
But we can end him and Islam forever.

1121
02:12:42,106 --> 02:12:44,164
Some of his fanatics are still with him.

1122
02:12:44,504 --> 02:12:45,902
They have the
advantage of the mountains,

1123
02:12:45,922 --> 02:12:47,101
the risk is too high.

1124
02:12:50,458 --> 02:12:52,376
Muhammad, listen!

1125
02:12:56,791 --> 02:12:58,789
A day for a day!

1126
02:12:59,309 --> 02:13:02,865
The day of Uhub
for the day of Badr!

1127
02:13:04,244 --> 02:13:07,481
Our dead have answered to your dead!

1128
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:15,473
Our dead are in paradise,
your dead are in hell fire!

1129
02:13:41,046 --> 02:13:44,872
Hamza... Hamza!

1130
02:13:48,679 --> 02:13:49,997
Do you hear me, Hamza?

1131
02:13:51,735 --> 02:13:56,271
Do you know that
I am with you, I, Hind!

1132
02:13:58,289 --> 02:14:00,487
Do you remember anything, Hamza?

1133
02:14:01,406 --> 02:14:03,823
How you killed my
father and my brother?!

1134
02:14:05,561 --> 02:14:07,279
Now you too are dead!

1135
02:14:08,558 --> 02:14:13,213
My heart is light!
Do you hear, Hamza? Light!

1136
02:14:19,806 --> 02:14:21,605
But I haven't finished with you!

1137
02:14:22,604 --> 02:14:24,102
Death is too small.

1138
02:14:25,541 --> 02:14:31,015
Wahshi, cut him open, cut him!

1139
02:14:52,852 --> 02:14:55,949
They lost a battle
and what do they do?

1140
02:14:56,269 --> 02:14:58,826
They come home and
dig the ground harder.

1141
02:15:00,405 --> 02:15:02,902
- They're mad.
- I agree with you!

1142
02:15:03,402 --> 02:15:08,257
They defy reason,
they are even happy they lost!

1143
02:15:11,693 --> 02:15:15,410
God sent their defeat they say,
to try them in their faith.

1144
02:15:16,029 --> 02:15:20,465
Oh yes! They are
fighting with the sky.

1145
02:15:21,703 --> 02:15:22,962
They'll get what they want.

1146
02:15:23,362 --> 02:15:24,660
They want Mecca.

1147
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,279
They'll get Mecca.

1148
02:15:26,339 --> 02:15:28,496
When we see the stars at noon...

1149
02:15:29,135 --> 02:15:32,951
Don't underestimate them,
I've learned that to my cost.

1150
02:15:35,169 --> 02:15:39,285
My friend, Mecca is
more than their home.

1151
02:15:42,022 --> 02:15:44,899
It's where God spoke to man.

1152
02:15:46,617 --> 02:15:51,972
Mecca is like a...
homesickness to the soul.

1153
02:15:55,768 --> 02:15:57,487
This year they're going as pilgrims.

1154
02:15:58,386 --> 02:15:59,125
What?!

1155
02:16:00,004 --> 02:16:01,223
Unarmed.

1156
02:16:01,742 --> 02:16:02,741
Unarmed?

1157
02:16:04,779 --> 02:16:07,457
Abu Sofyan will slaughter
them in the desert.

1158
02:16:10,253 --> 02:16:12,850
If you believe in God as they do,

1159
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:16,487
it might be possible
not to get slaughtered.

1160
02:16:20,523 --> 02:16:24,199
But I agree with you,
they probably will be.

1161
02:18:41,998 --> 02:18:43,057
Be still!

1162
02:18:43,257 --> 02:18:45,754
Do not let them provoke you,
that is what they want!

1163
02:18:46,194 --> 02:18:47,333
Stand firm!

1164
02:19:24,974 --> 02:19:27,172
Peace be to you.

1165
02:20:51,565 --> 02:20:54,163
The Prophet says: All who love God

1166
02:20:54,722 --> 02:20:56,181
must renew their oaths to him.

1167
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:57,419
Under the tree!

1168
02:21:49,265 --> 02:21:50,484
They've sent someone else.

1169
02:21:52,302 --> 02:21:53,162
It's Suheil!

1170
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,618
That means we might
come to an agreement.

1171
02:22:08,206 --> 02:22:12,682
Muhammad, you have been
given conditions of truce

1172
02:22:13,002 --> 02:22:15,000
between yourself and Mecca.

1173
02:22:16,258 --> 02:22:18,077
Have you agreed to them yet?

1174
02:22:29,884 --> 02:22:30,643
What is this?

1175
02:22:31,682 --> 02:22:34,819
In the name of God, the most gracious...

1176
02:22:36,557 --> 02:22:39,274
Who is this new God
they call, gracious?

1177
02:22:41,932 --> 02:22:44,030
I do not know him,
strike him out.

1178
02:22:45,328 --> 02:22:47,047
And I cannot agree with this...

1179
02:22:48,285 --> 02:22:50,823
"Muhammad, the messenger of God?"

1180
02:22:52,161 --> 02:22:54,819
If I have thought you
were the messenger of God,

1181
02:22:55,978 --> 02:22:57,596
I would not have fought you.

1182
02:23:00,653 --> 02:23:09,843
Make it, "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah
agrees with Suhayl, the son of Amr."

1183
02:23:10,342 --> 02:23:11,561
That is more factual.

1184
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:13,799
Well, so I understand.

1185
02:23:17,795 --> 02:23:18,914
Good, that is better.

1186
02:23:20,812 --> 02:23:22,690
Now, it is agreed...

1187
02:23:23,789 --> 02:23:27,086
that you do not
continue your pilgrimage,

1188
02:23:27,525 --> 02:23:29,983
you must turn around and go home.

1189
02:23:30,222 --> 02:23:31,781
Mecca is home.

1190
02:23:34,098 --> 02:23:35,097
However...

1191
02:23:37,355 --> 02:23:40,232
you may continue your
pilgrimage next year,

1192
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:42,750
and for 3 days only,

1193
02:23:43,609 --> 02:23:45,167
in and out.

1194
02:23:46,826 --> 02:23:50,401
We also agree to the
truce, for 10 years.

1195
02:23:52,139 --> 02:23:53,238
During that time,

1196
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:57,035
you will not attack any tribe,

1197
02:23:57,954 --> 02:24:00,151
or ambush any caravan,

1198
02:24:00,971 --> 02:24:05,626
or any individual associated
with us and vice versa.

1199
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:12,139
If you injure any one
of us, the truce ends...

1200
02:24:14,517 --> 02:24:15,836
...and vice versa.

1201
02:24:17,934 --> 02:24:18,913
Is that clear?

1202
02:24:27,484 --> 02:24:31,539
Ten years, ten years of peace.

1203
02:24:33,137 --> 02:24:34,696
We need that time.

1204
02:24:36,015 --> 02:24:38,013
We will use that time.

1205
02:25:03,067 --> 02:25:05,865
These letters, from Muhammad,
messenger of God,

1206
02:25:06,564 --> 02:25:07,963
to the rulers of the world...

1207
02:25:09,141 --> 02:25:10,780
...call the world to Islam!

1208
02:25:11,739 --> 02:25:14,075
To Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium,

1209
02:25:15,294 --> 02:25:17,772
Kisra, Emperor of Persia,

1210
02:25:18,711 --> 02:25:21,488
Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.

1211
02:25:24,905 --> 02:25:25,884
God go with you!

1212
02:25:26,403 --> 02:25:38,431
God is great! God is great! God is great!

1213
02:25:54,375 --> 02:25:57,751
There are no different races in Islam.

1214
02:25:59,389 --> 02:26:02,386
An Arab is not superior to a foreigner.

1215
02:26:03,375 --> 02:26:06,462
Nor a white man superior to a black.

1216
02:26:07,881 --> 02:26:09,719
All return equally to God.

1217
02:26:11,257 --> 02:26:14,914
Unless you desire for your neighbour,
what you desire for yourself...

1218
02:26:15,673 --> 02:26:16,852
...you don't have faith.

1219
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:22,206
A man goes to bed with his belly full,
while his neighbor is hungry...

1220
02:26:23,225 --> 02:26:24,504
...he isn't a Muslim.

1221
02:26:26,542 --> 02:26:30,518
The Ink of a scholar is holier
than the blood of a martyr.

1222
02:26:31,936 --> 02:26:36,312
A man reading is handsome
in the sight of God.

1223
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:39,468
So, learn to read.

1224
02:26:40,627 --> 02:26:42,265
And when you have learned...

1225
02:26:43,204 --> 02:26:44,043
...teach!

1226
02:26:45,322 --> 02:26:47,020
The people of the book,

1227
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:50,597
the Jews with their Bible,
the Christians with their testament,

1228
02:26:50,896 --> 02:26:52,495
must be respected by you.

1229
02:26:53,134 --> 02:26:55,392
For their books likewise
came from God.

1230
02:26:57,570 --> 02:27:00,387
You must not think of
Muhammad as more than a man.

1231
02:27:03,384 --> 02:27:05,382
He was collecting firewood one day.

1232
02:27:06,741 --> 02:27:08,159
"Let me do it," I said.

1233
02:27:08,978 --> 02:27:10,197
"Why?" he said.

1234
02:27:11,196 --> 02:27:12,695
"You are the prophet of God!"

1235
02:27:13,674 --> 02:27:17,470
"You can't go around
scratching for firewood."

1236
02:27:18,927 --> 02:27:21,565
But he looked at me, mumbling,

1237
02:27:23,003 --> 02:27:27,159
"God does not like the man who considers
himself above other men," he said.

1238
02:27:28,018 --> 02:27:29,856
So, I laid back and watched him.

1239
02:27:30,716 --> 02:27:32,034
Suddenly, he stopped.

1240
02:27:33,113 --> 02:27:36,570
He stood to his full
height and came to me.

1241
02:27:38,368 --> 02:27:41,844
"Yes, I am the prophet of God," he said.

1242
02:27:43,363 --> 02:27:47,019
"But even I do not know
what will become of me."

1243
02:28:32,013 --> 02:28:34,790
Amr, have you come to take me again?

1244
02:28:35,330 --> 02:28:35,949
No.

1245
02:28:37,408 --> 02:28:39,346
I have come to ask you to take me.

1246
02:28:59,685 --> 02:29:03,661
I witness that there is only one God,

1247
02:29:05,579 --> 02:29:08,975
and that Muhammad is His messenger.

1248
02:29:13,311 --> 02:29:15,748
May God forgive me the times
I have fought against you.

1249
02:29:17,567 --> 02:29:20,204
Islam does away with
all that went before it.

1250
02:29:26,537 --> 02:29:28,435
I'm sorry, I came in here wearing...

1251
02:29:31,672 --> 02:29:32,870
Here are my jewels.

1252
02:29:34,409 --> 02:29:35,548
What they are worth...

1253
02:29:37,526 --> 02:29:38,724
...I give to the poor.

1254
02:29:43,779 --> 02:29:45,727
- And may I offer you my...
- Yes.

1255
02:29:48,495 --> 02:29:50,932
But you were the
bitterest sword against Islam.

1256
02:29:56,906 --> 02:29:58,365
Now by the will of God...

1257
02:30:00,882 --> 02:30:03,260
...I will be the raised sword of God.

1258
02:30:21,101 --> 02:30:23,718
Ah, its all easy to God.

1259
02:30:24,817 --> 02:30:28,753
Just as he makes dying living,
he can make losing winning.

1260
02:30:29,872 --> 02:30:33,649
Two years ago we thought we were
beaten when we had to sign that truce.

1261
02:30:34,108 --> 02:30:35,167
Look at us now.

1262
02:30:35,846 --> 02:30:39,423
Charging from victory to
victory in the hearts of men.

1263
02:30:43,259 --> 02:30:44,018
What's that?

1264
02:31:16,804 --> 02:31:19,861
Abu Sofyan is coming!
Abu Sofyan!

1265
02:31:53,766 --> 02:31:55,405
Why am I insulted like this?

1266
02:31:57,503 --> 02:31:58,621
I'm Abu Sofyan!

1267
02:32:01,938 --> 02:32:03,337
I expect some courtesy!

1268
02:32:04,595 --> 02:32:06,414
We are not at war,
we have a truce!

1269
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:12,027
I have come to speak to
Muhammad, where is he?

1270
02:32:13,206 --> 02:32:14,145
He is in the mosque.

1271
02:32:30,988 --> 02:32:34,525
Muhammad, we did not break the truce.

1272
02:32:35,124 --> 02:32:37,122
I have come to reaffirm the truce.

1273
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:38,940
I speak for Mecca.

1274
02:32:40,708 --> 02:32:42,916
Muhammad, why do you turn from me?

1275
02:32:43,815 --> 02:32:44,495
Don't go.

1276
02:32:45,733 --> 02:32:46,872
Muhammad, don't go!

1277
02:32:48,331 --> 02:32:51,108
Bedouins broke the truce, not us!

1278
02:32:53,025 --> 02:32:54,324
The night was dark!

1279
02:32:55,483 --> 02:32:58,200
I am here to testify,
the night was dark!

1280
02:33:01,277 --> 02:33:04,214
Barra, Barra this is your city!

1281
02:33:08,270 --> 02:33:11,407
Hudayfa, you are my kin,
aim to see for me!

1282
02:33:11,566 --> 02:33:12,865
I must be heard!

1283
02:33:19,019 --> 02:33:20,657
I am Mecca!

1284
02:33:21,257 --> 02:33:23,435
I am the leader of Mecca!

1285
02:33:24,593 --> 02:33:26,472
Why am I insulted like this?!

1286
02:33:27,391 --> 02:33:30,428
Because you keep no promise
and respect no pledge.

1287
02:33:34,184 --> 02:33:36,161
I have heard what
I never thought I'd hear:

1288
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:38,838
Abu Sofyan asking for pity.

1289
02:33:44,872 --> 02:33:48,528
To be outfought, outfought,

1290
02:33:50,666 --> 02:33:52,844
outmaneuvered by a one-time shepherd!

1291
02:33:53,364 --> 02:33:56,261
You saw that shepherd's
religion grow from a speck.

1292
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:58,339
Speck was in my eye...

1293
02:34:00,696 --> 02:34:01,635
I could see nothing.

1294
02:34:03,973 --> 02:34:05,871
Tell Mecca their gods are dead.

1295
02:34:06,690 --> 02:34:08,588
It is useless to resist God.

1296
02:34:09,428 --> 02:34:13,583
Travel fast, or every man here
will be close behind you.

1297
02:34:14,502 --> 02:34:16,320
It's you who have broken the truce.

1298
02:35:01,064 --> 02:35:05,409
<i>For tonight will be ten thousand,
men from every tribe.</i>

1299
02:35:23,092 --> 02:35:25,050
Now we can fight them, you are back.

1300
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:27,667
We will close the streets,
and defend from the houses.

1301
02:35:33,262 --> 02:35:34,321
It's no use.

1302
02:35:35,859 --> 02:35:39,176
There are thousands of them,
every hour they are joined by more.

1303
02:35:39,296 --> 02:35:40,413
You coward!

1304
02:35:41,273 --> 02:35:42,771
Hind, go home!

1305
02:35:42,871 --> 02:35:44,030
You coward!

1306
02:35:44,649 --> 02:35:46,208
Are you the leader of Mecca?!

1307
02:35:46,607 --> 02:35:47,486
Look at yourself!

1308
02:35:47,966 --> 02:35:51,103
You are broke, they swallowed
you and spat you back!

1309
02:35:51,802 --> 02:35:55,199
Did my father and brother die,
for my husband to run away?!

1310
02:35:55,518 --> 02:35:57,037
You go home! You!

1311
02:35:57,057 --> 02:36:01,033
We can not resist! Mecca is taken.

1312
02:36:01,872 --> 02:36:04,749
No, no!

1313
02:36:11,342 --> 02:36:13,380
We are to camp here for the night.

1314
02:36:15,398 --> 02:36:19,434
I can see Mecca, even
through the mountains.

1315
02:36:30,562 --> 02:36:33,599
So many fires, I cannot count them.

1316
02:36:34,938 --> 02:36:36,396
It's very beautiful.

1317
02:36:38,554 --> 02:36:40,332
When we drove them out of Mecca,

1318
02:36:41,591 --> 02:36:43,709
I did not know they
carried Mecca with them.

1319
02:36:45,048 --> 02:36:47,146
We can smell the bread they're baking.

1320
02:36:47,385 --> 02:36:50,243
Yes, it means they don't intend to plunder,

1321
02:36:50,602 --> 02:36:52,680
at least I hope that's what it means.

1322
02:36:54,199 --> 02:36:57,016
They don't want blood on
their own walls and doorsteps.

1323
02:36:57,955 --> 02:36:59,393
I can bargain with that.

1324
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:42,789
Take me to him.

1325
02:37:43,888 --> 02:37:45,285
So you are giving us the city?

1326
02:37:51,739 --> 02:37:53,317
You offer me no bread.

1327
02:37:59,032 --> 02:38:00,111
I understand.

1328
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:02,728
You may decide to kill me.

1329
02:38:37,752 --> 02:38:39,250
Say what you have come to say.

1330
02:38:43,946 --> 02:38:45,584
I saw your fires,

1331
02:38:47,402 --> 02:38:48,501
the men around them,

1332
02:38:51,398 --> 02:38:54,655
and I know what power
you put into your men.

1333
02:38:58,012 --> 02:38:59,750
We can no longer resist Muhammad.

1334
02:39:01,788 --> 02:39:02,827
Now if you'll agree.

1335
02:39:04,026 --> 02:39:06,124
You dare to come here
and ask for conditions?

1336
02:39:07,162 --> 02:39:10,758
Isn't it time yet for you to
recognize who Muhammad is?

1337
02:39:13,155 --> 02:39:16,872
Muhammad, there is
still doubt in my heart.

1338
02:39:17,671 --> 02:39:20,308
If I were to cut off your head,
it would remove all your doubts.

1339
02:39:20,408 --> 02:39:21,028
Khalid,

1340
02:39:22,087 --> 02:39:23,785
there's no compulsion in religion.

1341
02:39:24,164 --> 02:39:27,521
A man may take many years
or only need minutes.

1342
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:31,018
It's God who decides the time.

1343
02:39:32,916 --> 02:39:34,654
So respect his doubts.

1344
02:39:40,348 --> 02:39:45,903
You're a black slave,
you are the best school.

1345
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:51,077
I am only what God has given me.

1346
02:39:53,494 --> 02:39:54,273
Yes.

1347
02:39:57,130 --> 02:39:58,529
The gods that I worshipped,

1348
02:40:00,187 --> 02:40:01,426
they don't have any use.

1349
02:40:04,623 --> 02:40:05,722
It would have helped me.

1350
02:40:11,296 --> 02:40:17,170
I declare, under no compulsion:

1351
02:40:20,547 --> 02:40:22,006
there is one God,

1352
02:40:26,081 --> 02:40:29,998
and you are the messenger of God.

1353
02:40:31,956 --> 02:40:32,994
Now, let me go.

1354
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:46,479
Get inside!

1355
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:35,626
No doors may be broken down,
nothing plundered, nothing seized!

1356
02:44:35,686 --> 02:44:37,204
No one abused!

1357
02:44:37,664 --> 02:44:40,781
All behind closed doors are safe!

1358
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:44,196
All in Abu Sofyan's house are safe!

1359
02:44:44,516 --> 02:44:47,593
All by the Kaaba are safe!

1360
02:44:55,525 --> 02:44:59,681
At least he kept his word,
they haven't forced a door.

1361
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:05,295
He's stolen hearts, not walls.
It's a permanent victory.

1362
02:45:06,694 --> 02:45:08,392
I dread going out.

1363
02:45:09,511 --> 02:45:12,248
We must, we must at the end.

1364
02:45:16,144 --> 02:45:17,503
Were we so wrong?

1365
02:45:19,381 --> 02:45:23,057
The way we lived,
yes, that was wrong.

1366
02:45:24,536 --> 02:45:26,593
We were trapped in our own faults.

1367
02:45:27,791 --> 02:45:29,310
Our gods were less than us.

1368
02:45:30,649 --> 02:45:35,224
Now there he is, making
his entrance to the Kaaba.

1369
02:47:21,935 --> 02:47:26,730
<i>In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.</i>

1370
02:47:28,668 --> 02:47:33,323
<i>God gave this house to
Abraham to be a sacred place.</i>

1371
02:47:34,422 --> 02:47:39,457
<i>Worship no other gods but Him
and cleanse his house.</i>

1372
02:49:58,854 --> 02:50:00,193
<i>So it was.</i>

1373
02:50:00,832 --> 02:50:04,548
<i>Muhammad took no
revenge and allowed none.</i>

1374
02:50:05,308 --> 02:50:07,885
<i>He declared Mecca a holy place.</i>

1375
02:50:08,454 --> 02:50:11,761
<i>No one may shed blood
or cut down a tree,</i>

1376
02:50:12,181 --> 02:50:14,678
<i>or kill a living thing in Mecca.</i>

1377
02:50:16,077 --> 02:50:18,593
<i>Soon, all Arabia was converted.</i>

1378
02:50:18,993 --> 02:50:20,571
<i> Not only to the new worship</i>

1379
02:50:20,731 --> 02:50:25,147
<i>but to the new laws, manners,
attitudes contained in Islam.</i>

1380
02:50:26,226 --> 02:50:29,243
<i>The Prophet had lived
to see his work done,</i>

1381
02:50:29,862 --> 02:50:32,899
<i>but now he began to
feel the nearness of death.</i>

1382
02:50:34,418 --> 02:50:37,095
<i>One great act of his
prophethood remained,</i>

1383
02:50:37,494 --> 02:50:38,893
<i>the setting of it's seal.</i>

1384
02:50:39,932 --> 02:50:41,510
<i>He called the people to him</i>

1385
02:50:41,770 --> 02:50:45,466
<i>and he spoke for the last time
His message of surrender to God</i>

1386
02:50:45,946 --> 02:50:47,544
<i>and humanity to man.</i>

1387
02:50:49,742 --> 02:50:52,439
''Oh, mankind! Listen well!"

1388
02:50:52,939 --> 02:50:55,097
"I may not be with you much longer."

1389
02:50:56,096 --> 02:50:59,611
"The weak among you,
feed them on what you eat."

1390
02:51:00,071 --> 02:51:01,869
"Dress them as you are dressed."

1391
02:51:02,988 --> 02:51:04,786
"You will meet your God,"

1392
02:51:04,926 --> 02:51:07,703
"and He will call you to
account for your actions."

1393
02:51:08,882 --> 02:51:12,838
"Let those who are present
warn those who are absent."

1394
02:51:14,357 --> 02:51:16,355
"You are all are descendant from Adam,"

1395
02:51:16,734 --> 02:51:20,371
"and the best among you
is he who most regards God."

1396
02:51:21,749 --> 02:51:24,287
"Think deeply about what I say."

1397
02:51:25,885 --> 02:51:28,602
"Let all your feuds be abolished."

1398
02:51:29,421 --> 02:51:33,717
"You must know that every Muslim
is the brother of every other Muslim."

1399
02:51:34,017 --> 02:51:36,954
"And all Muslims are
brothers one of another."

1400
02:51:37,893 --> 02:51:41,668
"Between Muslims, there
are no races and no tribes."

1401
02:51:42,647 --> 02:51:44,885
"Nor must you take
anything from your brother,"

1402
02:51:45,085 --> 02:51:47,203
"except what is given freely."

1403
02:51:48,421 --> 02:51:52,397
"Do not oppress
and do not be oppressed."

1404
02:51:54,236 --> 02:51:55,514
"O my people,"

1405
02:51:55,874 --> 02:51:57,412
"I am but a man."

1406
02:51:58,551 --> 02:52:02,447
"It may be that the angel
of death will visit me soon,"

1407
02:52:02,947 --> 02:52:04,985
"and death will overtake me."

1408
02:52:06,304 --> 02:52:08,122
"But I have left you a book,"

1409
02:52:08,441 --> 02:52:11,658
"revealed by God, the Quran,"

1410
02:52:12,118 --> 02:52:14,815
"which is light and guidance."

1411
02:52:16,034 --> 02:52:19,630
<i>Now he repeated to the people
the final revelation of the Quran,</i>

1412
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:21,648
<i>the seal and termination,</i>

1413
02:52:22,487 --> 02:52:25,523
<i>not Muhammad's words,
but God's word:</i>

1414
02:52:26,982 --> 02:52:30,039
''This day I have perfected
your religion for you"

1415
02:52:30,378 --> 02:52:32,476
"and completed my favour to you"

1416
02:52:32,976 --> 02:52:36,412
"and I've chosen for you
Islam as your religion.''

1417
02:52:38,231 --> 02:52:41,667
<i>On June the 8th, 632,</i>

1418
02:52:42,027 --> 02:52:44,085
<i>in his 63rd year,</i>

1419
02:52:44,504 --> 02:52:46,362
<i>Muhammad died.</i>

1420
02:52:47,321 --> 02:52:50,019
<i>Many of his followers
could not believe the fact.</i>

1421
02:52:50,508 --> 02:52:52,876
<i>How can such a man die?</i>

1422
02:52:53,615 --> 02:52:57,651
<i>But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friend
stood up in the mosque:</i>

1423
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:00,408
"If anyone worships Muhammad,"

1424
02:53:00,568 --> 02:53:02,906
"let him know that Muhammad is dead."

1425
02:53:03,545 --> 02:53:05,602
"But he who worships God,"

1426
02:53:06,461 --> 02:53:10,737
"let him know that God
is alive and can not die.''

1427
02:53:14,953 --> 02:53:18,649
<i>They buried Muhammad
beside his mosque, in Medina.</i>

1428
02:53:20,208 --> 02:53:24,204
<i>But the religion he preached
found it's place in the heart of man.</i>

1429
02:53:24,883 --> 02:53:28,319
