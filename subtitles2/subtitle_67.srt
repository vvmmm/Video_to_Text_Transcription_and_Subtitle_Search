FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,579
How did you find out about Dad?

4
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,616
Tae-hyung came to my work
saying that I should know about it, too.

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,620
{\an8}When?

6
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,091
{\an8}Yesterday.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,707
{\an8}It means Tae-hyung
is taking it seriously too.

8
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,006
{\an8}Dad had insomnia. It's been quite a while.

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,683
{\an8}He even went night hunting before.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,350
{\an8}Don't get agitated
without thinking things through.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,603
{\an8}Then he should've taken the pills,
not collected them.

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,016
{\an8}I looked into it,

13
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,978
{\an8}and long-distance drivers
and those who work at night

14
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,651
tend to suffer from depression.

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,153
A side effect
of antidepressants is suicide.

16
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,895
Isn't it terrifyingly ironic?

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,740
Dad might've been taking antidepressants.

18
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,002
Antidepressants. Sleeping pills.

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,837
These wordsâ¦

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,088
don't seem to fit Dad.

21
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,092
Why not?

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,965
Because dad dropped out of middle school

23
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,433
and worked all his life,

24
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,223
he can't get insomnia and depression?

25
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,183
You think his life was simple?

26
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,766
Why are you being so abrasive?
Why are you getting worse as time passes?

27
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,483
They're having a great time.
They told me to call you over.

28
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,654
I have editing to do.

29
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:53,073
Okay, I'll tell them that you're busy.
I know you won't enjoy this occasion.

30
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,494
I truly love your wisdom, CEO.

31
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,374
Don't let your guard down
because they're having a good time.

32
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,963
It can change in an instant.

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,127
He worries too much.

34
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,725
Have a good weekend. See you on Monday.

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,475
TEAM LEADER EUN-HEE

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,030
Remember?

37
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,278
Mom only took you
and ran away from the house.

38
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,617
You were absent from school
for a long time too.

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,544
I was so happy that you came back home,

40
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,748
but you didn't talk to me for a long time.

41
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,296
You weren't the only one I didn't talk to.
I didn't talk to anyone for a long time.

42
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,382
Why not?

43
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,468
You must be bored.

44
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,969
Not at all. I like to listen.

45
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,636
I cried every night,

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,057
but you came home
with wildflowers in your hand.

47
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,704
I came in with wildflowers in my hand?

48
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,870
Memories are so selfish.

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,490
It only knows itself.

50
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,038
-That's a fact.
-I don't remember

51
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,462
whether I had wildflowers
or a rock in my hand.

52
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,541
At the time,

53
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,843
I was cold and hungry every day.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,010
But you were wearing new clothes
and a lovely headband,

55
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,009
and eating the food Dad cooked.

56
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,227
I was wearing new clothes
and a lovely headband?

57
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,190
Yes. This is how different
memories can be.

58
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,071
So don't say it's a fact so mindlessly.

59
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,485
Cold and hungry?

60
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,068
That wasn't the war times or anything.

61
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,534
I worried more about school

62
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,074
than being cold and hungry.

63
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,333
When I saw the kids going to school
with neat backpacks,

64
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,250
I envied them.

65
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,257
So, why did Mom take you with her?

66
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,551
She should've taken me.

67
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,014
I've always hated going to school,

68
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,555
since the first day of kindergarten.

69
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,429
I guess Mom didn't want to
make you suffer.

70
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,227
From then until even now,

71
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,151
Mom won't let you and Ji-woo suffer.

72
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,480
If someone hears that,

73
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,824
they might think
I grew up like a princess.

74
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,990
When I was in college,

75
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,648
I worked like crazy, right?

76
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:43,316
I worked as a contract teacher
and as a private tutor on weekends.

77
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,408
I made as much money
as large corporate employees did.

78
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,754
And as I gave all that money to my family,

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,250
I got exhausted.

80
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,841
You should charge that to Ms. Lee Jin-sook
and Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

81
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,128
Why is it me all the time?

82
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,881
I'm saying I made money
and helped pay tuition too.

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,634
-You're drunk. Drink some water.
-I'm not drunk!

84
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,389
Eun-hee.

85
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,356
My friend's husband

86
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,873
started to leave the house,
saying he was going to smoke,

87
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,869
buy something to drink,

88
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,621
take out the trash,

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,420
and even mow the lawn.

90
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,594
Holding his phone tightly in his hand.

91
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,836
He was cheating on her.

92
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,215
They got divorced.

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,299
RUN, FATHER

94
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,511
Are you having an affair again?

95
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,635
It's not an affair.

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,850
We broke up.

97
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,314
I said we should take time
to think about it.

98
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,685
Seeing you grabbing your phone once more,
I don't feel like breaking up.

99
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,435
We broke up, and we had time
to wrap things up.

100
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,031
But I guess there's no need to.

101
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,410
Take that photo with you.

102
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,381
I can carry them to your house.

103
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,383
It's okay. You can go from here.

104
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,348
Mr. Yoo, who studies
fruits and vegetables,

105
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,598
please come out.

106
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,849
What are you saying?

107
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,925
This is a real estate office.

108
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,652
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,693
Where's Mr. Yoo?

110
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,034
Can you take her home?

111
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,030
It will get messier if you're with us.

112
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,532
Just go, quietly.

113
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,824
-Go.
-Mr. Yoo.

114
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,027
Where are youâ¦

115
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,077
Eun-joo, what do you know?

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,710
-You know nothing.
-Be quiet.

117
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,709
Mr. Yoo.

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,840
"Have a good weekend. See you on Monday."

119
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,129
Yes, you're telling me not to call you
during the weekend, right?

120
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,144
Where do you want to sleep?

121
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,926
-Eun-joo.
-Goodness.

122
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,392
-Hey.
-We were born from the same tree,

123
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,936
but why are we so different?

124
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,280
Why am I not smart and sharp like you?

125
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,529
I said, where do you want to sleep?

126
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm so tired.

127
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,419
Why did my Dad do that?

128
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,506
Dad.

129
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,525
Come to Ulsan with me.

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,200
It seems like you're bothered,
so let's go meet him.

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,200
I am not keeping
any more secrets from you.

132
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,113
Kim Ji-woo. Why aren't you going home
at this late hour?

133
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,534
The subway stopped running.

134
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,664
Is it that late already?

135
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,583
It seems like
you don't want to go home these days.

136
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,879
With the upcoming summer break.

137
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,841
I was thinking hard about

138
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,761
whether or not to go to the military.

139
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,929
And that bastard Jong-pal said
he started dating Eun-hee.

140
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,389
They became a college couple.

141
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,431
It's been a while since
I heard that expression. College couple.

142
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:22,189
So, you went to serve in the military
because my sister got a boyfriend?

143
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,274
There was a girl named Na-ri.

144
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,476
Na-ri?

145
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,613
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

146
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,735
Na-ri.

147
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,368
I can never forget it.

148
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,156
What?

149
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,828
The typhoons only came
to southern regions, where I was serving.

150
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,674
I was a second private,
and I went through hell.

151
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,211
I thought, "Yes, sure, go ahead and date."

152
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,128
"I'm going to fight against a typhoon."

153
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,715
The typhoon was named Na-ri.

154
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,554
Chan-hyuk.

155
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,046
You liked my sister.

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,770
You dummy. I liked Eun-joo.

157
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,557
See?

158
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,226
You liked my sister.

159
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,903
I didn't, you jerk.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,280
Ji-woo, don't sleep there.

161
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,701
Ji-woo, lay this outâ¦

162
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,742
Ji-woo, sleep here.

163
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,906
Sleep with me here, Ji-woo.

164
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,996
My eldest sister

165
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,594
has no father.

166
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,248
No, wait. How should I say this?

167
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,462
Dadâ¦

168
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,086
isn't her father.

169
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,554
No.

170
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,217
She has a different father.

171
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,351
Now, why did I hear such a thing?

172
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,564
Come on, your father is her father,

173
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,358
and her father is your father.

174
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,153
What?

175
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,986
Ms. Jin-sook, I love you.

176
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,115
I really, truly love you.

177
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,373
I had forgotten.

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,000
There was a time when he declared
his love for me many times a day.

179
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,627
You declared your love for me
a lot as well.

180
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,139
You were too shy to actually say it,

181
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,184
so you wrote "I love you" on the note.

182
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,727
Whenever you made my lunch boxes,

183
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,943
I really loved looking for those notes.

184
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,449
Don't sneak out. Let's finish talking.

185
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,763
CLOSET: PETER YOON'S CHATROOM

186
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,586
What are you doing in there?

187
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,143
Charging.

188
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,136
Charging my phone.

189
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,477
Tae-hyung left his laptop.

190
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,481
Is that okay?

191
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,740
What's with the face?

192
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,945
Oh.

193
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,703
Hangover.

194
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,724
Eun-joo.

195
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,259
Don't look.

We're family.

00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,778
We are family.

199
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,704
but we don't know much

200
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,242
about each other.

201
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,580
Mom.

202
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,424
Mom. You spent a lot of money
to see your doctor son-in-law.

203
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,424
I really love these clothes.

204
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,271
You should've just given me
the money to buy clothes.

205
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,228
Ji-woo, what's with the face?

206
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,527
Just laugh. Don't hold it in.

207
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,067
Mom, do I have to wear this?

208
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,865
This is our first time seeing him.
First expressions are important.

209
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,661
Jong-pal is no match
for my future brother-in-law.

210
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,039
We should eat together.

211
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:51,933
Wow.

212
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,431
Dad, you look great.
That shirt looks perfect on you.

213
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,064
You need to shave.

214
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,231
It'll be done if you just shave once.

215
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,809
Dad, my newest shaver is now all charged.

216
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,145
You just need to move it a few times.

217
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,479
Jeez.

218
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,909
-Stop it.
-Why?

219
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,580
You don't need to shave,
so please wear that.

220
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,036
It's too uncomfortable to eat.

221
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,206
Welcoming a new family member
isn't a comfortable thing.

222
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:31,006
I'm glad you brought that up.
He's going to be our family anyway,

223
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,801
so what's the point of wearing this?

224
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,925
I didn't dress you up
to make you look good.

225
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,717
It's our first time meeting him,
so we need to be polite.

226
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,927
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,855
You're intimidated by the doctor
son-in-law from a family of doctors.

228
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,648
Money is the best for you, isn't it?

229
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,780
Yes, money is the best!

230
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,108
Because my daughter
doesn't have to live like I did!

231
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,578
I love my doctor son-in-law to death!

232
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,003
So wear it for your daughter!

233
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,790
-Wear it!
-What's wrong with your life?

234
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,630
Did you have an extremely hard life?

235
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,550
-Did you work?
-All right!

236
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,719
I lived my life comfortably
with the money you made!

237
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,894
So wear it!

238
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:19,058
You just want me to sign up
for life insurance and die, right?

239
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,349
Enough talk about that insurance!

240
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,099
Stop it if you aren't
actually going to die!

241
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,836
Nice to meet you.

242
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,501
I'm Yoon Tae-hyung.

243
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,681
It was a bad dream.

244
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,226
It didn't really happen.

245
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,476
I'm sure it didn't.

246
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,621
Eun-joo.

247
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,331
Stop reading it.

248
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,370
What's the point?

249
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,013
Eun-joo.

250
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,965
Open the door.

251
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,345
Stop it.

DAD

254
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,497
Eun-hee. This is your father.

255
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:12,252
Do you remember the day when my doctor
son-in-law first visited our house?

256
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,507
Was I there, too?

257
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,294
I read it because Dad texted.

258
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,174
Why did he ask
about Tae-hyung all of a sudden?

259
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,546
I guess he remembered something.

260
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,724
Are you okay?

261
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,104
I'm sure Dad's frustrated
about being unable to remember.

262
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,639
Reply to him now.

263
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,139
And you should go too.

264
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,309
I want to be alone.

265

We had dinner together.

You drank with Tae-hyung,
though you're a lightweight.

267
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,368
Do you remember something?

268
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,451
No.

269
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,369
I think I had a similar dream.

270
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,172
Dad said he was dozing off
and had a dream.

271
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,047
Looks like his memories
will come back soon.

272
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,809
This injection will be a bit painful.

273
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,492
First injection pregnancies are very rare.

274
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,736
It's almost impossible.

Answer me.

00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,392
-Answer me, you cowardly bastard!
-What's the use of calling him now?

280
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,886
-He's at a seminar.
-Let go!

281
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,270
You go.

282
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,066
I'll just stay quiet in a corner.
Don't tell me to go.

283
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,151
I said I wanted to be alone.

284
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,816
How can I leave when you're like this?

285
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,874
You've been ignoring me for years,
and now you're worried about me?

286
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,707
Why are you crying?

287
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,786
That's a vulgar curiosity.

288
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,497
"What happened in this house?"

289
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,963
"You acted all smart and look at you."

290
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,418
That's what you're thinking.

291
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,836
I'm sorry.

292
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,389
Iâ¦

293
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,217
I'm sorry.

294
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,848
Why are you sorry?

295
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,903
It must be great for you
to say sorry that easily.

296
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,397
For a few yearsâ¦

297
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,649
You cut me off
and came to see me all of a sudden.

298
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,605
And you simply said sorry meaninglessly!

299
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,073
You didn't mean it.

300
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,787
You donât take anything seriously.

301
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,538
Eun-joo, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

302
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,831
I'm sorry, Eun-joo, Iâ¦

303
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,495
-Get out.
-No.

304
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,883
Leave me alone! Let go!

305
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,551
I'm sorry, Eun-joo!

306
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,760
Let go of me, damn it!

307
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,240
-Eun-joo, what are you doing?
-Let go!

-Eun-joo, don't do this!
-Let go!

310
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,844
Let go of me!

Aren't you uncomfortable?

Hey.

00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,859
Why are you sleeping here like this?

Gosh.

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,490
I guess I fell asleep

It's cold.

Whatâ¦

322
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,995
What kind of gibberish did I say?

323
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,999
That my sister is your first love.

324
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,059
Goodness.

325
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,116
My eldest sister

326
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,664
has no father.

327
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,162
Dad isn't her Dad.

328
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,954
She has a different father.

329
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,011
Chan-hyuk, can you give me the water?

330
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,386
Okay.

331
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,980
Ji-woo, I remember nothing
about what happened yesterday.

332
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,118
I can't remember anything from yesterday.

333
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,908
I didn't blackout.

334
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,702
But I can't seem to remember.

335
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,699
That's crazy.

336
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,718
Why did you leave me on the chair?

337
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,227
My neck hurts.

338
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,559
Hey, I told you to sleep on this
so many times,

339
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,395
but you just passed out.

340
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,605
You do remember everything.

341
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,621
You remember what I said
about Eun-joo, right?

342
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,419
The burden was too heavy
to keep to myself.

343
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,746
It feels like I shared it with you.

344
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,975
A private safe and a burden carrier.

345
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,813
Why is everything
being tangled up like this?

346
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,037
Our second daughter told me all about it.

347
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,502
She said I listened to music a lot
whenever I drove the truck.

348
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,844
Ms. Sook?

349
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,426
No, thanks.

350
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,215
Most of them are the music you like.

351
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,981
This is the movie we saw together
for the first time.

352
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,023
A farewell event for "Dr. Zhivago."

353
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,477
It was in theaters for only a week.

354
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,405
But before I saw it with you,

355
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,712
I saw it twice all by myself before that,
to be honest.

356
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,787
When you asked me to go see
a farewell event for Dr. Zhivago.

357
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,258
I didn't know what a farewell event

358
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,178
or Dr. Zhivago was,
so I saw it secretly beforehand.

359
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,339
It was a bit difficult to understand.

360
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,480
But the bigger problem was
that I cried so much.

361
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,308
I cried so much
everyone at the theater stared at me.

362
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,070
I'm sorry for crying so much

363
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,913
when I saw it with you, too.

364
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,454
You smiled just like that
when I cried back then.

365
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,496
Let's go now.

366
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,255
Where are we supposed to meet that guy?

367
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,340
The thing isâ¦

368
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,138
he won't answer his phone.

369
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,221
You said you're supposed to meet him.

370
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,886
Yes, but he's not answering.

371
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,056
Call someone else.

372
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,654
Call who?

373
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,154
A friend who knows you well

374
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,321
or Young-sik's mother.

375
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,158
What did we need to confirm
that led us here again?

376
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,686
People might think
we pulled each other's hair and fought.

377
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,112
Even though I'm reckless,

378
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,778
I won't grab your hair.

379
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,294
Everything is so ridiculous.

380
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,389
You should go home now.

381
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,469
I can't.

382
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,508
Not after what I saw.

383
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,137
There are too many weapons at this house.

384
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,096
Don't get any crazy ideas. That's not it.

385
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,824
I wanted to cut my hair.

386
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,278
All of a sudden? How does that make sense?

387
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,318
It's true.

388
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,278
I wasâ¦

389
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,245
so heartbroken and frustrated,

390
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,710
so I wanted to cut my hair.

391
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,538
I thought I would feel better.

392
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,183
Do you think his family knows?

393
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,510
I think they don't.

394
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,137
They might not know.

395
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,063
Families are clueless.

396
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,191
Families may know
and pretend they don't know.

397
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,197
I hope he's not getting weird ideas.

398
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,408
He came to see me
and asked me to look after you.

399
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,581
Like he's never coming back.

400
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,211
If he had weird ideas,
he wouldn't leave his laptop here.

401
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,918
It means he doesn't want to
lie about it anymore.

402
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,296
He must not have the courage
to tell me in person.

403
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,980
So it wasn't my fault.

404
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,860
Tae-hyung

405
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,320
got colder and more depressed.

406
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,031
He didn't seem like a human
living on Earth.

407
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,156
I thought it was my fault,

408
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,958
but it's not my fault.

409
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,538
-About you working again.
-I've always thought of divorce.

410
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,252
That's very good.

411
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,641
I thought I was so smart.

412
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,185
-You are.
-I thought I could figure out everything

413
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,769
about anyone with a short conversation.

414
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,360
But I didn't know my husband.

415
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,943
Come to think of it,

416
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,994
he's been sending me indirect signals,
but I didn't recognize them.

417
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,040
I would've noticed
if he wasn't my husband.

418
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,621
I didn't know because he was family.

419
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,503
Because I was close to him.

420
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,004
Are you blaming yourself?

421
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,417
He's just a cowardly, irresponsible,

422
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,974
and shameless guy,
who's been tricking himself too.

423
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,089
I will solve the problem within my family.

424
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,506
Don't mind it, and just go.

425
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,261
If this happened to me,

426
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,016
what advice do you think
you would've given me?

427
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,726
"Be rational, not emotional."

428
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,731
"Think practically."

429
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,901
"Get compensated double
or triple the years you suffered."

430
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,823
"No one will point fingers at you."

431
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,821
"Get alimony,

432
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,201
shake it off, and come back."

433
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,662
Thisâ¦

434
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,504
is what you would've told me.

435
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,045
Young-sik has been out of reach
for the past few days.

436
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,263
Did you go check his house?

437
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,264
Wellâ¦

438
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,811
His house was empty
like he ran away at night.

439
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,361
I heard you're going to start working.

440
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,569
What?

441
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,279
Wellâ¦

442
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,736
I heard there's a lot of work
around this time.

443
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,566
Ma'am, please excuse us.

444
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,035
Why did you bring your wife
when you're here to see Young-sik?

445
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,552
Is there a reason

446
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,508
why she shouldn't come?

447
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,102
I don't understand you.

448
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,724
Deal with your issues between yourselves.

449
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,728
Some people in Jeil Logistics team
lent Young-sik money.

450
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,440
They were all demanding to see you,
but I stopped them.

451
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,148
They didn't lend it to him
because they trust him.

452
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,744
But they trusted you.

453
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,029
Where's Young-sik's house?

454
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,991
Are you really ill or something?

455
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,410
You can't remember the place
where you were born and raised?

456
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,117
Near the Hungry Bridge?

457
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,508
If so,

458
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,851
please call me when Young-sik comes.

459
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,848
-Okay, I will do that.
-Yes, please.

460
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,220
Thank you.

461
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,398
Lots of people are trying
to get my position,

462
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,451
so I decided to start working right away.

463
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,830
I'll take you to the terminal,
so go back to Seoul.

464
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,869
I'll go after loading the truck
and unloading it in Incheon.

465
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,923
About Young-sikâ¦

466
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,714
I'm going to keep calling him.

467
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,427
You were too shy to actually say it,

468
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,220
so you wrote "I love you" on the note.

469
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,030
Dad.

470
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,124
You came too, Eun-hee?
But you must be busy.

471
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:29,041
I just need to run some tests
because my son-in-law made an appointment.

472
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,501
I heard you started working.

473
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,791
It's not hard at all.

474
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,384
I'm not facing any troubles in working.

475
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,670
You didn't need to come.

476
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,923
I stopped by during my lunch break.

477
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,471
It's almost time.

478
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,929
Go say hi to your mother-in-law.

479
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,432
Letâs go.

480
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,063
All right.

481
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,063
Do you want me to go with you?

482
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,687
She's not here.

483
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,741
She has a class to teach today,
so she's at school.

484
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,359
If I do see her, I'll see her alone.

485
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,238
You're driving your truck
just as you used to.

486
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,287
Do the surroundings seem unfamiliar?

487
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,212
No.

488
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,500
Is there anything uncomfortable?

489
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,463
No.

490
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,714
There aren't any aftereffects either.

491
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,166
It's all normal.

492
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,086
I was born healthy.

493
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,104
Did you manageâ¦

494
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,308
to talk to Tae-hyung?

495
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,768
His phone is off.

496
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,895
And mind your own business.

497
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,278
Please show some respect to your sister.

498
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,992
Don't say it like I'm interested
in this for some ulterior motive.

499
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,122
Thenâ¦

500
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,369
don't ask me anything.

501
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,215
What's wrong with you two?

502
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,799
Don't worry.

503
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,310
They said I'm very healthy
and everything's normal.

504
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,056
Where's Mom?

505
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,562
They said his memories
will be back in one or two days.

506
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,305
Why is it taking so long?

507
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,647
We can't say it's taking long just yet.

508
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,653
Each person recovers differently.

509
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,985
Sometimes he remembers things
from 30 years ago so clearly,

510
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,405
but sometimes he says
something totally different.

511
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,210
You confessed your love
for me a lot as well.

512
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,880
You wrote "I love you" on the note.

513
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,000
It's like he's making things up
when he knows everything.

514
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,932
I don't know how much I should believe.

515
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,390
NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE

516
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,484
Sometimes memories tell lies.

517
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,020
It may be a mixture of the dreams
he had often at the time,

518
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,815
or his long wishes and obsessions.

519
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,201
Dad, why don't we go outside first?

520
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,832
-How are you these days?
-I'm fine.

521
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,793
What did you talk about? Is he not well?

522
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,463
It's not like that.

523
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,052
They said he should have a thorough
checkup if his memories don't come back.

524
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,014
Ask Tae-hyung when he comes back.

525
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:34,008
We sent the document for this
marketing project to 530,000 offices.

526
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,808
We'll proceed only
with the offices that reply to us.

527
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,272
As you can see,
we marked the market research graphâ¦

528
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,775
Yes?

529
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,900
Ms. Kim.

530
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,946
You have to rewrite the proposal
for the meditation book.

531
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,527
What?

532
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,244
Similar books have been published
by other publishing companies.

533
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,123
Yes, sir.

534
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,174
Come to my office to get the materials.

535
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,794
I'll find them on my own.

536
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,416
You can't find them
unless you speak English and Spanish.

537
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,713
Come and get them.

538
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,927
What the heck?

539
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,930
Is the vice CEO showing off
about speaking English and Spanish?

540
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,975
VICE CEO IM GEON-JOO

541
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,980
I can speak neither English nor Spanish,
so how can I use these as references?

542
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,072
I mostly picked photos

543
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,940
and translated the important parts.

544
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,822
If it's still hard,
want to do it at my house?

545
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,776
I have something simple to explain.

546
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,081
I'll check it first.

547
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,251
About being out of reach

548
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,252
-on the weekendâ¦
-I know why, so you don't need to explain.

549
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,463
I'm sorry.

550
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,125
What would've happened

551
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,054
if I went up without calling you
at the parking lot?

552
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,597
That made me realize the reality.

553
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,814
Secret dating was exciting
only a few times,

554
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,480
but now it's tiring and frustrating,
and I feel cowardly.

555
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,272
Really?

556
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,523
Then am I the only one
who's still heart-fluttering?

557
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,647
Don't play dumb. It doesn't suit you.

558
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,907
I'm saying I donât want to keep on doing

559
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,834
something tiring and frustrating.

560
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:21,409
If you're not tired or frustrated by me,
let's talk in the evening.

561
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,542
I have an evening appointment.

562
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,755
I really won't take them.
We have a lot left.

563
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,983
I don't need those.
I still have some left from last time.

564
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,860
It looks like Dad is resting,

565
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,359
so I'll just leave now.

566
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,820
Are you and Eun-hee getting along now?

567
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,451
It was good to see you two together.

568
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:58,414
Even if she lacks some things
and acts dumb, so be patient with her.

569
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,662
Mom.

570
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,663
Since we were young,

571
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,747
you said that too much
when Eun-hee is around.

572
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,673
That can hurt her.

573
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,792
She doesn't lack anything.

574
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,166
She's not dumb.

575
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,680
You asked me to have dinner.
What's with this serious vibe?

576
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,138
You want something to drink?
We can get food too.

577
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,809
Are you paying? Then I'd like some coffee.

578
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,852
COFFEE BEANS

579
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,766
Which coffee bean do you want?

580
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,725
Anything's fine.

581
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,105
One cup of Yirgacheffe coffee
and one egg toast, please.

582
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,116
I'll cherish it in my heart

583
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,618
What's with the blank look?

584
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,249
You're not dating Seo-young?

585
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,383
When was your last relationship?

586
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,264
Why can't you tell me?

587
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,049
I don't want to answer.

588
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,432
-Are you dating someone?
-Do you think I am?

589
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,549
I can date only when I have something.

590
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,016
I decided to have a business relationship
with Mr. Playboy.

591
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,770
I'll stop calling him Mr. Playboy.

592
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,153
According to the flow
of what you're saying,

593
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,400
are you asking me out?

594
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,738
-Are you a lunatic?
-Thank goodness you're not.

595
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,528
Then what are you trying to say?

596
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,488
Eun-joo was driving her husband's car.

597
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,285
That car is huge,
but she's good at driving it.

598
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,000
What is this now?

599
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,382
She married into a rich family.

600
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,958
She got a fancy car as a gift
when she got married.

601
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,764
But she was scared of driving,

602
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,129
so she said she'll never drive.
Then she gave me the car.

603
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,429
We sold that car to make two used cars,

604
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,852
so one car at my house, and one for me.

605
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,437
Why aren't you saying,
"Eun-joo is awesome?"

606
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,438
Bragging about your love family now?

607
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,858
Loving? As if.

608
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,617
Eun-joo was the breadwinner
of my family once.

609
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,623
But I hated it.

610
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,786
Talking like she was making
so many sacrifices for the family.

611
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:17,296
I hated it because she made me feel
like I'm indebted to her.

612
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,295
I didn't know I was this petty.

613
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,637
Come on, you're making me worried.

614
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,231
My sister,

615
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,281
Eun-joo,

616
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,735
resented me.

617
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,825
She said I'm acting to be a sister

618
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,036
after ignoring her for years.

619
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,129
I act like I'm so nice and cool
to other people

620
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,469
and try to please others,

621
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,338
but I guess I was nasty to her.

622
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,734
Youâ¦

623
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,896
Did something happen between you two?

624
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,864
I regret it so much.

625
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,149
I just

626
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,238
regret it like crazy.

627
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,869
On that day.

628
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,158
At that time.

629
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,748
I had to stop it

630
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,036
no matter what.

631
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,587
You're getting married next month?

632
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,552
Did I hear it correctly?

633
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,346
-Here's aged wine.
-Dad.

634
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,643
-Honey, go get a glass.
-Okay.

635
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,557
-Bring a ladle too.
-Okay.

636
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,726
I wasn't going to open this
until I get a son-in-law.

637
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,280
A couple getting married
after dating for three months

638
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,123
seemed too lukewarm.

639
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,409
My brother-in-law.

640
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,544
What do you like about her?

641
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,537
What an uncreative question.

642
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,384
Is your publishing company okay
with having you?

643
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,510
I don't think they're okay.

644
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,376
I'm honestly curious, that's why.

645
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,012
Are you

646
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,926
struggling to find
anything you like about her?

647
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,352
Oh, no.

648
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,062
She doesn't act girly.

649
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,898
At that time, my heart sank.

650
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,781
She isn't the type to let that go.

651
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,815
I thought they'd break up
even before setting a wedding date.

652
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,282
Butâ¦

653
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,576
Girly things?

654
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,366
What are those?

655
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,004
What you're doing.

656
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,292
Calling him your brother-in-law,

657
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,035
asking childish questions,

658
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,337
and talking gibberish
like a baby while drunk.

659
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,590
I was going to say,
"Isn't that a bit dangerous to say?"

660
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,966
But Eun-joo stood up for him.

661
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,352
"Eun-joo loves him."

662
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,515
Drink it.

663
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,942
That's what I thought.

664
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,779
"Yes, if so, I need to shut up."

665
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,739
Okay.

666
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,739
That's just how I am, right?

667
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,780
It means she doesn't act
like she's pretty,

668
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,034
distinguished, or smart.

669
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,536
Eun-joo is honest and straightforward.

670
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,869
"Acting like something."

671
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,617
So that's what girly things meant.

672
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,830
On that day,

673
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,092
I felt anxious.

674
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,759
That's been bothering me this whole time.

675
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,888
But why are you regretting that dayâ¦

676
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,358
right at this point?

677
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,778
Are Eun-joo
and her husband having trouble?

678
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,124
Why did you keep
Eun-joo's wedding photos until now?

679
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,871
They're black-and-white.

680
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,541
That means you developed
each and every one of them in a darkroom.

681
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,673
Do you really like my sister?

682
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,250
No, if you think of it like that,
I like you more.

683
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,836
How many black-and-white photos
have I given you until now?

684
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,843
I kept myself in the darkroom to develop
the photos I took of you one by one

685
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,308
and hung them up one by one,
so they could dry well.

686
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,059
-Shut up.
-So I'm saying,

687
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,231
why do you keep talking about Eun-joo?

688
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,811
Wellâ¦

689
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,019
You said

690
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,863
Ji-woo seems troubled these days.

691
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,573
I thought about it,

692
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,162
and recently, Ji-woo kept asking me

693
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,486
to go to Eun-joo's house.

694
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,905
Told me to be nice to her.

695
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,413
And he said that felt sorry for her.

696
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,075
Didn't he say anything to you?

697
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,709
If he has something to say,
he'd say that to you directly.

698
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,934
I realized this recently.

699
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,637
It seems like you know more
about Ji-woo than I do.

700
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,435
So if you find out what's troubling him,

701
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,099
tell me.

702
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,187
Okay.

703
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,819
But

704
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,700
you should be nice to Eun-joo too.

705
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,213
{\an8}DIANA: A WIFE IS SOMEONE WHO HELPS HIDE
OUR IDENTITY YET IS SOMEONE TO DESPISE

706
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,053
VICE CEO IM

707
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,973
I saw you parking your car.

708
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,815
You shouldn't use the address
of the employees like this.

709
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,953
I heard you're taking a day off suddenly.
I was worried that it was because of me.

710
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,581
I'm too old to take a day off

711
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,830
to stay in my room and cry
because of a guy.

712
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,330
I walked around the area while waiting,

713
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,287
and I saw many lovely cafes

714
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,048
and lots of pubs too.

715
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,219
Let's go.

716
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,640
-It seems weird.
-No.

717
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,891
Let's insert this part here.

718
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,484
So it can show.

719
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,729
So this looks better.

720
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,058
Are wedding invitations nowadays in 4D?

721
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,819
It is covered in a super bad fragrance.

722
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,572
Did the sender spray it personally?

723
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,902
Leave it there.

724
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,107
It's from Park Yoon-ji.

725
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,411
Park Yoon-ji?

726
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,872
She told me via social media, texts,

727
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,991
and now an invitation?

728
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,163
Can I open it?

729
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,366
Hey, don't open someone else's mail.

730
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,036
A wedding invitation
is like advertisement flyers.

731
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,336
It's not personal mail.

732
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,760
Whatever. You're distracting me,
so go away.

733
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,969
No way.

734
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,971
It's personal mail.

735
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,732
She did spray bad perfume on it.

736
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,531
Wellâ¦ An invitation and a personal letter.

737
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,914
How impressive.

738
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,032
It's either one of these.

739
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,954
"Screw you," or "This is my piece
of lingering regret."

740
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,208
I'm sure it's not, "Screw you."

741
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,960
Because Chan-hyuk totally got dumped.

742
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,802
Thanks for the harsh fact.

743
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,839
Whether you got dumped or you dumped her,

744
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,673
if your exes aren't avoiding you

745
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,138
and aren't afraid of you spreading rumors,

746
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,508
that means you're a fine man.

747
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,328
Did you know

748
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,372
how you were looking at me in the office?

749
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:15,253
"You coward, you're so disgusting."
"Don't talk to me ever again."

750
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,843
That was what I saw.

751
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,549
If that's what you saw,
then I guess that's what I meant.

752
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,717
I'm sure you want me
to be brave and honest,

753
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,556
and not do things
like thinking of breaking up slowly.

754
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,771
I read this in a book.

755
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,438
If a human being lives his or her life

756
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,574
in a such just and honest way
all the time,

757
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,202
the heart can't handle it and explodes.

758
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,030
So you need to make excuses
from time to time.

759
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,947
Use tricks when you can't help it.

760
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,786
And realize that you're cowardly
and repent.

761
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,377
This is the way to make your heart
handle things.

762
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,673
So you want to be

763
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,132
somewhat cowardly

764
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,045
and use some tricks

765
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,354
for the sake of your heart?

766
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,516
I'm saying I don't want to drift apart
from you.

767
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,078
And we broke up.

768
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,298
By the way, why did you take a day off?

769
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,296
It's a family matter.

770
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,762
It's complicated.

771
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,972
You know, about your friend,

772
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,306
from the hamburger place.

773
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,691
Mr. Park Chan-hyuk.

774
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,771
You memorized his name?

775
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,105
You have a good memory.

776
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,984
Do you tell Chan-hyuk,

777
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,493
"It's a family matter."
"It's complicated."

778
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,487
or tell him everything
without being vague?

779
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,867
So you do tell him everything.

780
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,170
Anyway,

781
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,172
if there's anything
I can help with, tell me.

782
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,050
Vice CEO.

783
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,604
I don't think you two
broke up because of me.

784
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,773
The relationship being estranged
without progress.

785
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,981
I know it very well too.

786
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,694
Soâ¦

787
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,895
I wonât feel burdened.

788
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,238
Butâ¦

789
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,357
I feel comfortable as it is now.

790
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,988
Nowadays, the best thing
for me is to feel comfortable.

791
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,252
Okay.

792
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,038
If you're comfortable as it is now,

793
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,165
we can hang out like this as friends.

794
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,456
I'll make you feel comfortable.

795
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,866
I can't understand anything.

796
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,090
Answer the phone.

797
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,052
Answer the phone, you cowardly bastard!

798
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,802
Leave me alone! Let go!

799
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,255
-What are you doing?
-Let go!

800
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,014
-Let go!
-Don't do this!

801
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,613
Are you going somewhere?

802
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,822
What brings you here at this hour?

803
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,363
Today's my day off.

804
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,985
Then why come here?

805
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,413
I'm busy. I have to go to
the KIPO for the deadline.

806
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,373
I'll take you.

807
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,123
You said you'll never drive
because you're scared

808
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,576
but you drove Tae-hyung's car.

809
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,463
Next time you want to give me something,
just give it to me.

810
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,634
I'm not like you, so I take
free things without hesitation.

811
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,974
All that becomes debt.

812
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,179
Not for me.

813
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,259
I don't ignore the sincerity of the giver.

814
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,263
It's late,

815
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,598
but thank you for the car.

816
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,691
And for that,
I'll be your driver today. Let's go.

817
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,028
No way.

818
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,118
Kim Eun-joo can make people laugh?

819
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,000
She can make them laugh that much?

820
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,803
Okay, goodbye.

821
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,104
Patent Attorney, you look exhausted.

822
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,055
I'll take you to eat right away.

823
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,846
Do you think Tae-hyung arrived?

824
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,203
FAMILY
DAD

825
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,036
FAMILY
FATHER

826
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,080
Hi.

827
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,291
Mom, are you awake?

828
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,705
Isn't it cold?

829
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,580
It's not cold. I slept well.

830
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,900
Drive safely.

831
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,579
Dad, that's an awesome photo!
Where is it at?

832
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,294
{\an8}ELDEST DAUGHTER: DRIVE SAFELY

833
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,415
{\an8}YOUNGER DAUGHTER:
THAT'S AN AWESOME PHOTO! WHERE IS THAT?

834
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,720
I wonder what thoughts Dad had
whenever he drove.

835
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,481
I think of all kinds of things
whenever I drive.

836
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,351
He drove long-distance almost every day.

837
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,573
I wonder what kinds of thoughts
came to his mind

838
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,652
when he drove on the same route
365 days a year.

839
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,967
The phone is turned offâ¦

840
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,010
Do you know any doctors
who went to the seminar with him?

841
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,600
He should've arrived by now.

842
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,893
Call your in-laws, at least.

843
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,227
I'm really worried now.

844
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,274
If something happened,
I'm sure he would've called me.

845
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,278
He's just avoiding me.
Because that's the easiest.

846
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,082
Ji-woo.

847
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:58,955
Yes?

848
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,963
Stop shaking your leg.

849
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,473
Chan-hyuk, no matter
how much I think about it,

850
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,434
it was wrong for Mom and Dad

851
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,024
to keep it a secret.

852
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,229
Shouldn't they
at least tell her the truth?

853
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,059
Then say that to your parents.

854
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,395
I can't. Dad is 22 years old right now.

855
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,651
Then tell your mother.

856
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:22,902
I canât.

857
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,114
Then tell Eun-hee.

858
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,993
I can't. I just can't.

859
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,287
Then should I tell Eun-hee?

860
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,580
Yes.

861
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,937
CHAN-PAL

862
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,782
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

863
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,863
She's just declined.

864
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,197
She'll call you back.

865
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,003
Okay then, I must get going.

866
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,624
You can do it.

867
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,469
Sang-sik!

868
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,845
Hey!

869
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,558
Are you done, or are you taking off?

870
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:47,148
Come on, I'm not like you.
I don't work twice a day.

871
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,864
My daughter told me to just YOLO.

872
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,528
YOLO?

873
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,487
It means to live happily in the moment,

874
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,834
instead of working all the time
like you do.

875
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,964
So you need to reduce your workload

876
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,589
and YOLO.

877
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,841
That hurts.

878
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,972
Come on, did you just say it hurts?

879
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,969
When I gave you a massage before,

880
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,431
you said your fatigue was gone
and bought me a meal.

881
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,763
You don't remember that?

882
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,431
Did you know

883
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,846
who Young-sik is?

884
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,654
Young-sik, who worked at the Ulsan plant.

885
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,944
Young-sik?

886
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,444
Well, I did say hi a few times in passing,

887
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,318
but you never talk about that, soâ¦

888
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,572
"That?"

889
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,406
What's "that?"

890
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,664
Wellâ¦

891
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,918
Your privacy.

892
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,506
You're so scared.

893
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,638
Yes. Just donât try to remember it.

894
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,099
No. Just play dumb
even if you do remember.

895
01:06:58,973 --> 01:06:59,933
Why?

896
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,306
When I saw you last time,
your wife was at least seeing you

897
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,194
with pitiful eyes, like a lost puppy.

898
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,070
If that memory comes back,
then it will all go to waste.

899
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,400
You'll graduate from marriage.

900
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,655
Graduate from marriage?

901
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,829
What's graduation from marriage?

902
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,095
Yes.

903
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,767
I'm coming now.

904
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,569
Who is it?

905
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,822
It's temporarily closed,
so the director isn't here.

906
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:02,038
Would you like me
to refer you to a different clinic today?

907
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,289
-Hi.
-Hi.

908
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:07,581
I'm so sorry. I'll get you connected
to a different clinic.

909
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,746
You can go there byâ¦

910
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,626
crossing the street.

911
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,048
NOTICE

912
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,382
WE ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED

913
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,515
YOON TAE-HYUNG FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC

914
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,061
Hi.

915
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,813
Hi.

916
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,573
You're the barista, right?

917
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:32,689
Yes.

918
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,953
Why are you here early in the morning?

919
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,740
I'm a patient here.

920
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,333
Okay. Do you live around here?

921
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,133
That cowardly bastard.

YOON TAE-HYUNG FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC

923
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,526
What is this feeling?

924
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,158
We're leaving first.

925
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,365
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

926
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,785
Have a safe trip back.

927
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:38,631
That cowardly bastard.

928
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,304
I can't help but curse.

929
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,635
How dare you curse?

930
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,890
-Look what he's doing. He's killing us--
-You.

931
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,233
Don't even say a word.

932
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,225
That cowardly bastard.

933
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:02,532
Eun-joo.

934
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,985
Stop it.

935
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,447
Go to work.

936
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,075
Don't miss work because of this.

937
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,447
Yes, Ji-woo.

938
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,953
Hello, Dad. Where are you?

939
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,662
The Incheon plant.

940
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:51,624
The Incheon plant.

941
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,629
I finished at dawn, so I got some sleep.

942
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,035
I will move for a short distance at lunch

943
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,208
and go home in the evening.

944
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,762
Mom is worried, soâ¦

945
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,183
Tell her not to worry.

946
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,181
I'm moving around within Incheon.

947
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,223
Okay, I will.

948
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:20,730
Mom, Dad is working at the Incheon plant,
and he'll be home in the evening.

949
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,989
Okay, go to work.

950
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:25,863
Goodbye.

951
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,062
-I'm leaving.
-What?

952
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,192
This is what you call
going home right on time.

953
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:04,107
Your sister's been ignoring my calls
since yesterday.

954
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,244
Come on, no way.

955
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,704
Call her while I'm watching.

956
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,946
Goodness.

957
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:22,209
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

958
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,469
Welcome.

959
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,107
I'm here to see someone
who works at this hour.

960
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,359
Isn't he here yet?

961
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,360
You mean Barista Ahn?

962
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,532
He said he has a family matter
going on today.

963
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,319
One hot Americano, please.

964
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,697
Okay.

965
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,999
Thank you.

966
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,958
By the way, how do you know him?

967
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,763
Well, it's hard to say.

968
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:08,795
He's in Goheung.

969
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,843
He called me in the morning

970
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,218
and said something urgent
happened to his family.

971
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,354
Do you know where Sorokdo is?

972
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,350
INTERNIST OH MI-SOOK

973
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:28,741
Yes.

974
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,964
I really missed you, my daughter-in-law.

975
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,916
It's so good to see you.

976
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,930
How have you been?

977
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,179
It's been the same.

978
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,643
Have a seat.

979
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,386
Right.

980
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:57,683
Waitâ¦

981
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,310
Do you want to go eat
something delicious for dinner?

982
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,645
Have you eaten?

983
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,373
I'm back.

984
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,733
Go take a shower first.

985
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:56,244
Ms. Sook, thank you.

986
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:01,291
Thank you so much for staying
with someone like me

987
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,121
for such a long time.

988
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:07,837
Iâ¦

989
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,211
remember.

990
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,892
I remember everything now.

991
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:26,649
Let's

992
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,148
graduate from marriage now.

993
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,359
Do you know where he goes

994
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,737
whenever he disappears?

995
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,070
Don't use someone else as a shield.

996
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,655
She married you because she loved you.

997
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,080
You knew that and you used her.

998
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,489
Where are they?

999
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,367
Do you think Ms. Sook cried a lot too?

1000
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,211
I'm sure she wanted to kill you.

1001
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,753
There's something
I can finally help you with, right?

1002
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,586
I know. I know everything.

1003
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,761
-Is there something wrong?
-You want to end it here.

1004
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,720
So why did you come here for?

1005
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,090
And I haven't even gotten started.

1006
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:43,812
