ï»¿1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,640
So you're assuming
that my grandma Mumtaz

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,840
is Abdul's own daughter
just like Bahadur Uncle?

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Hmm.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
Seems like it.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,640
Amanat Khan adopted Mumtaz
as his granddaughter.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,800
All this time we've known
that my grandma died mysteriously.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,200
So my grandpa was responsible
for it?

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,720
I can't accept it, Alap.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
You think I can, Shruti?

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
A maestro like him
is actually a murderer?

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,520
Hey!

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,120
Something must be wrong.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
But Amanat Khan's riddle...

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
has shown me a way.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
What way?

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,720
"Sarod, sitar, flute, santoor,
shehnai, sarangi, rudrabina.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,360
All who possess the discs are 'udara'.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,720
'Bibadi' is Mumtaz's daughter".

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,360
The last line is very significant.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,160
It is central
to cracking the mystery.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,320
What makes you think so?

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,160
"Sarod, sitar, flute,
santoor, shehnai, sarangi".

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,840
Those who received the discs
play the respective instruments.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
But your mom?

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
She was given the disc
with a rudrabina on it.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Why?

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
She never learnt to play the rudrabina.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,600
Hmm.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,760
And who is "bibadi Mumtaz's daughter"?

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,680
We don't have time
to think about all this.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
I think we need to go to Rudrapur
immediately.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,639
Naad stole the discs
to find Raga Sanjivani...

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,600
- Rohini Aunty is in danger and here we're...
- No, Shruti.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
There's no point going there
before solving this riddle.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
Mom might get into bigger trouble.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Shruti.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,320
For the next few days,
don't go anywhere without me.

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,520
Why?

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,960
It's clear that Naad was behind the attack
on Ma'am.

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Hmm.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,200
And...

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
it wasn't for Kedar Mishra.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
It was for Mumtaz.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Someone might attack
you and Saaz too.

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,039
Because both of you
are Madanti's descendants.

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,520
This is such a fix.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,840
We should file a police complaint
against Naad.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
No point.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,800
However...

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,640
we'll need your mom's help
for something else from the police.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
For something else?

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Some... About what?

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Such files aren't ready at hand.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
It's a case from 50 years ago.

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,400
I looked for it urgently
only because you requested me.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
What are you looking at?

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,720
There's nothing to see.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Nothing abnormal in the case.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,720
In your mother Mumtaz's case

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,320
it was a plain and simple
brain haemorrhage.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,840
- Tell me something.
- Yes?

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Did my mother's corpse have a symbol
like Noorjahan's?

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,160
I didn't find anything.
Did you?

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,679
Are you investigating the symbol
we saw this time?

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
I admit...

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,760
that it looks like the symbol
of the Shiva temple in Rudrapur.

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
But suppose someone commits a murder

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,240
and puts a stamp
of the Ashok Stambh on the body.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,160
Can I arrest the Government of India
for that?

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
What?

71
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,400
What is he even...

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,520
I think he means to say that
the temple is a public place, after all.

73
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,040
If someone uses the symbol
for a crime...

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
Exactly.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Besides, you are classical musicians.

76
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
You know how it is.

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,280
The royal family of Rudrapur
is extremely influential.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,000
Politically influential.

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
They are well-respected people.

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,240
Should we really drag them into this?

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Do you have anything more to know?

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
No, Ma'am.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,439
We will arrest Naad.

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,640
I've alerted
all the nearby police stations.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,640
- Naad is from Rudrapur. Definitely...
- No.

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
He's from Sanatanpur.

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,040
I've checked his voter ID.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
We've verified that he's a resident
of that village.

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Huh!

90
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,240
Are we done?

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
- Yes, let's go.
- Hmm.

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
- Thank you.
- See you.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,840
What's the matter with you?

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Why do you keep coming back
without finishing the job?

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,120
- Answer me.
- You asked me to kill Noorjahan.

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
I did.

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,320
You asked me to get the disc.
I did.

99
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Please release me now.

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Why is Noorjahan's daughter Saaz
still alive?

101
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Hmm?

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,160
What has that innocent girl
ever done to you?

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
Why do you want to kill her?

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,240
Innocent?

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Innocent, huh?

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,320
They are lower-caste people
like you.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,480
The woman who dared to touch the rudrabina
was their ancestor.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,679
Those sinners deserve to die.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
Instead, they're leading
a respectable life.

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,120
- And your people are paying for it.
- I don't believe you.

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,800
What's the problem
with women musicians?

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,880
I've seen women singing
outside Rudrapur.

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,120
And publicly.

114
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,520
They're not inferior to you.

115
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,320
You've deceived us all these years.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Going outside the village
has corrupted your mind.

117
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,000
You need to cleanse yourself.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Do as I say.

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,320
Go.

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,040
What happened?

121
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Go!

122
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,719
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA

123
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
What happened?

125
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Go!

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Hey.

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,840
- Don't kick me...
- Hey!

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
Why did you beat my mom like that?

129
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Do I owe you an explanation?
Huh?

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,320
We are human too.

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,120
We have self respect too.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Get that into your head.

133
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Such audacity!

134
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't think we can use Naad anymore.

135
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
But we've got the disc.

136
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,960
Unless we crack the notation...

137
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,200
we won't be able to do anything.

138
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Can you lose hope right now?

139
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
No, right?

140
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,840
Come here.

141
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,720
Okay, forget all this for some time.

142
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
- Shruti.
- Hmm?

143
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,000
They won't harm Mom, right?

144
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,240
I just got five months with her.

145
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,240
Nothing will happen.

146
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
Everything will be fine.

147
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,840
Please sing a song.

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,320
I haven't heard you sing in so long.

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Please sing.

150
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
Listen to me.

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,080
You'll feel better.

152
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
At least, sing for Rohini Aunty.

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
Hmm?

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
If I sing...

155
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,160
will Mom be able to hear me?

156
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Of course.
She's your mom, after all.

157
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Moms can just feel it.

158
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
Please sing.

159
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,280
Time stands still without you

160
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,880
Where are you, Mom?

161
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,520
While the world sleeps in peace

162
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm awake all night, Mom

163
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,999
You brought me peace

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,400
But sleep comes no more

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Time stands still without you

166
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
Where are you, Mom?

167
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Who wakes alone
With the love of a mother?

168
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:26,640
The delusional ties
Keep her awake

169
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,120
You're living far away
And all I have is pain

170
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,520
You brought me peace
But sleep comes no more

171
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,480
When will your pains
Wither away?

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Your eyes will find
The long-lost happiness

173
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,320
When will the pain of our birth
Ebb away?

174
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:03,720
In the everlasting night
The dawn is never to be found

175
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,680
Time stands still without you

176
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,520
Where are you, Mom?

177
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,079
While the world sleeps in peace

178
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,240
I am awake all night, Mom

179
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,440
You brought me peace

180
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,000
But sleep comes no more

181
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,480
What happened?

182
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,920
Nightmare?

183
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,520
Shruti.

184
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
I've seen that symbol before.

185
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
Symbol?

186
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,760
- Oh...
- On someone else's body.

187
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
Who?

188
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,560
On whose body?

189
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,680
Hey!

190
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
Come fast!

191
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,799
- Where?
- Fast!

192
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,920
Wait up.
On whose body did you see it?

193
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
This way.

194
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
I think this is the lane.

195
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,720
Hey, it's Chotu.

196
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,640
Hey.
How are you Chotu?

197
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
Where's Anadi Uncle?

198
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
What?

199
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
He ran away!

200
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Hey... wait!

201
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,120
Chotu!
Hey...

202
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
Why did you run away...

203
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh my God!

204
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,320
Chotu...

205
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,720
When did this happen?

206
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,240
See?

207
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,520
Nothing can be kept secret forever.

208
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
I have a lot to know from you.

209
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,680
What...

210
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,360
- do you want to know?
- History.

211
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,319
The history of how Rudrapur
is connected to Anandagarh.

212
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,480
I don't know... what you mean.

213
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,240
Are you going to risk this child's life?

214
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,800
Tell me the truth.

215
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,600
We know about Kedar Mishra's connection
to Rudrapur.

216
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
Now tell me, how are you connected
to Rudrapur?

217
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,040
I beg of you...

218
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,520
please don't kill my grandson.

219
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
I'll...

220
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,680
I'll tell you everything.

221
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,160
Everything.

222
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm one of you.

223
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm a Domor too.

224
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,440
I used to work
in the Shiva Temple of Rudrapur.

225
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,840
It's true.

226
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Yes.

227
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,320
Back then, the Naad of Rudrapur was...

228
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,920
Kedar Mishra.

229
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Hmm.

230
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,360
You had committed a grave crime.

231
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,960
Tell me about it.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,080
Come on, speak up!

232
00:19:54,305 --> 00:20:54,623
