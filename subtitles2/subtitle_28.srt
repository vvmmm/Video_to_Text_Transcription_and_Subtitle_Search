JEFF PROBST: In just one
week, 16 strangers begin the

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,942
adventure of a lifetime when
<i>Survivor: Africa</i> premieres.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,579
Tonight, meet the new Survivors,
see clips from their audition

4
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:19,518
videos, and catch an exclusive
preview of the first episode.

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,854
Also, hear from the people who
know firsthand what this unique

6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:27,392
experience is like: the men and
women of<i> Survivor I</i> and<i> II.</i>

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,029
They talk straight about their
time on the island and in the

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,265
outback, they share their
feelings about each other, and

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,701
reveal their personal secrets
for playing the game.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,004
The lesson to new Survivors
is: this game is not about

11
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,673
building huts and catching fish.

12
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:45,477
It's a game of people playing
against people.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:51,883
PROBST: All this tonight on
<i>Survivor: Countdown to Africa.</i>

00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,419

<i>Survivor: Countdown to Africa.</i>

17
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,379
Next week, 16 Americans will
learn what it takes to outwit,

18
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,716
outplay, and outlast the
competition in the heart of

19
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,118
Africa.

20
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,987
In the next hour, you'll meet
each of them and see excerpts

21
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,023
from the audition tapes that got
them selected.

22
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,827
Tonight, we offer you an
insiders' guide to<i> Survivor:</i> how

23
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,431
to watch, whom to watch, and
what to watch for, with some

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,237
help from the people who know
best that the battle begins...

25
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,972
the very first moment.

26
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:30,048
You are witnessing 16 Americans
begin an adventure that will

27
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,250
forever change their lives.

28
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,252
I thought I had survival skills.

29
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,253
That counted for nothing.

30
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,722
Don't get on anybody's nerves.

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,890
Don't piss anybody off.

32
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,627
Strategy happens the moment
we got off that plane.

33
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,061
You don't need a leader.

34
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,508
And then again you don't want
to be too much of a weak link.

35
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:50,535
The leaders are the targets.

36
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,571
Here's what we plan on doing.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,000
High tide is that line right
there.

38
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,408
See that line?

39
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,008
Actually, before we build the
shelter, just knock that whole

40
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,643
branch off.

41
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,945
What's the first thing we
need to do?

42
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,026
Let's see what we got first,
before we make any decisions.

43
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,915
Let's see what we got.

44
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,684
Are you guys all done talking?

45
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,853
I think we're off to a bad
start.

46
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,054
This is not a very good move.

47
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,624
This is not how to conduct
yourself on the first day after

48
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,159
a three-hour swim ashore.

49
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,895
Yeah, after seeing Richard up
a tree originally, I couldn't

50
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,798
imagine him surviving this
episode.

51
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,078
Rich is just sitting in the
tree, number one, trying to tell

52
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,368
everybody to talk.

53
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:23,969
I'm looking up at the tree,
like, "What the hell are you

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,203
doing up there?

55
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,649
You should be down here talking
to us."

56
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,973
And what's the point?

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,776
He's so separate, and he's up
in the tree and acting so

58
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,876
condescending.

59
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,979
To me, the very wrong way to go
about it.

60
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,446
I'm good to go, survival-wise.

61
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,682
I've got the million-dollar
check written already.

62
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,195
It's that kind of cocky attitude
that makes people really hate

63
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,286
your guts.

64
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,355
Richard really didn't know
what he was talking about.

65
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,824
Anybody could have won the
million at that point.

66
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,471
Richard's doing what he only
knows what to do: sit on his ass

67
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,229
and talk.

68
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,632
Big mouth.

69
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,078
(chuckles)
In my head at the time, all I

70
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,670
thought when I was walking away:
"He's just a lazy fat ass."

71
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,671
Action, man.

72
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,672
Action, Richard.

73
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,006
You don't want to act ahead.

74
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,408
Richard's a very smart man.

75
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,789
I don't think he was really
concerned if, at that point, if

76
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,745
people liked him or not.

77
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,547
He knew he had something to
offer.

78
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,359
He did play a masterful game,
but there was also other factors

79
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,584
involved.

80
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,822
I feel as if luck played a role
in Richard winning.

81
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,325
I can't play armchair
<i>Survivor</i> and say he did the

82
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,905
wrong thing, 'cause he ended up
winning.

83
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,795
You can't just go sit in a tree
now.

84
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,298
If Richard was sitting in a tree
on<i> Survivor II,</i> trust me, he

85
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:33,272
would have been made short order
of that day.

86
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,641
We need five more of these.

87
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,478
I didn't have any conscious
strategy, other than I knew when

88
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:45,016
I hit the island that-that I
wanted to build a shelter.

89
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,620
What you'll notice is that
there are people that try and do

90
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,921
things on their own.

91
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,957
There will be people that will
try to be the go-to guy.

92
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,326
I'm gonna keep working.

93
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,161
B.B. builds buildings for a
living, and he built a great

94
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,841
building, but it was in the
wrong location.

95
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,832
If you're a fisherman, that's
your best asset.

96
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,099
Check that out.

97
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,536
If you're a chef or a cook,
that's your best asset.

98
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,904
It is so good!

99
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,873
But you need to be good at it
out there.

100
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,709
That way people want to keep you
around.

101
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,144
You tell me what you're doing
here, and I'll help you.

102
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,493
I promise you, I'll do it quick.

103
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,326
That's the right way to do
it, but we won't have near

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,582
enough line.

105
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,283
Anyway, don't stop now.

106
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,122
B.B. probably did work harder
than anybody else, uh...

107
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,258
but I think he was in too much
of a hurry.

108
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,570
We're okay, but none of the
others are down here helping

109
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,293
carry stuff.

110
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,683
I don't think he likes me much.

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,096
You can't have lazy people.

112
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,367
You know, you can't do what
you normally do at home out in a

113
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,135
new environment with strangers.

114
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,072
I got to have this
positioned right.

115
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,274
He's used to having people
working underneath him.

116
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,808
He's used to being the one in
charge.

117
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,978
But when you come to the island,
the outback, Africa, you leave

118
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,346
all that behind.

119
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,047
B.B. thought that he could
just work, work, work, work,

120
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,515
work.

121
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,586
You know, I asked Colleen to
straighten this out for me, and

122
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,655
here it is.

123
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,233
It's the only thing she had to
do today.

124
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,891
He had to realize this isn't
corporate world, you know,

125
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,025
you're not our boss.

126
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,294
You're all on a level playing
ground.

127
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,675
You can't just sit here and
tell me what to do and I'm going

128
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,810
to do it, because if I say no,
what are you going to do, fire

129
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,166
me?

130
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,278
You've cut it four times and
it's still too short, right?

131
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,702
Shh...

132
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,214
B.B. gave us enough reason to
vote him out by being bossy and

133
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,673
overbearing.

134
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,074
But I think I was caught up
in my own ego and my own

135
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,246
determination to get this thing
built, and I think I sort of

136
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,615
lost sight of the objective.

137
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:24,816
B.B. was an ass.

138
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,518
I made a lot of mistakes.

139
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,988
PROBST: B.B., the tribe has
spoken.

140
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,996
First impressions in this
game are everything.

141
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,333
You don't want to separate
yourself at all from your group.

142
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,536
Staying off the radar is the
only way to survive.

143
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,783
If you take a stand as a
leader right off the bat and

144
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,373
people don't like you, you're
screwed.

145
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,841
We got enough rocks here, too.

146
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,276
We could build a pretty decent
shelter just using rocks.

147
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,524
You know, Richard Hatch in
the first<i> Survivor</i> was the

148
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:58,349
"leader," and I thought coming
into this second one, anybody

149
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,485
that set themselves up to follow
in his footsteps was an instant

150
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,820
target.

151
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,155
It was stupid to do.

152
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,935
Let's just stop for one
second and look at the map and

153
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,325
look at the compass.

154
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:07,825
See, if we're going southwest,
how are we going to hit the dry

155
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,260
creek bed?

156
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,595
Because that's north!

157
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,098
There's a time to listen,
there's a time to keep your

158
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,400
mouth shut, and there's a time
to talk out there.

159
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,737
She made it very obvious that
she was going to try to take

160
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,307
control and tell people what to
do, and we hadn't even spoken to

161
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,175
each other yet.

162
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,410
She offered herself up.

163
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,645
Debb needed to go immediately.

164
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:32,249
One individual in the group
is... ordering everybody around.

165
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,863
In the green hat right here,
can you help her get one side of

166
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,953
this undone?

167
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,556
I'm sitting there thinking to
myself, "Debb, you're digging

168
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,258
your own grave here."

169
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,405
And sure enough, when it came to
the first vote, she was the

170
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,961
first one voted off.

171
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,297
It's been a little cold a
couple nights here.

When we come back, the
importance of alliances.

174

But now let's meet the first
four men and women of<i> Survivor:</i>

<i>Africa.</i>

176
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,517
Silas Gaither, a bartender from
Germantown, Tennessee.

177
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,929
I'm a big family man, and I
want to support my wife and kids

178
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,487
totally.

179
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,289
If she'd like to work, she can
work, though.

180
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,058
I don't mean to, you know...

181
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,694
politically correct here.

182
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,496
PROBST: Carl Bilancione, a
dentist and the father of two

183
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,365
from Winter Springs, Florida.

184
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,733
I'm not your typical dentist.

185
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,078
Most of them are fat and bald-
headed and divorced.

186
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,469
Not me.

187
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,837
I've completed six marathons.

188
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,472
<i>Survivor's</i> easy.

189

Florida.

191
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,312
Why do I think I'll make the
ultimate Survivor?

192
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:39,417
I'm a Puerto Rican female... the
heat, the rice, bring it on.

193
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,652
I'm ready to go to work.

See ya!

195
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,189
PROBST: And Tom Buchanan, a
farmer and the father of one,

from Rich Valley, Virginia.

197
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,794
Come on, we're going to
<i>Survivor.</i> Woo-hoo!

198
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,031
Come on, doggies, here we go!

199
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,866
Let's hit the big show, boys!

200
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,735
We're gonna be a star!

201
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,446
PROBST: Whether it's on an
island, in the outback, or deep

202
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:14,386
in Africa, the game remains the
same: 16 strangers abandoned in

203
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,222
the middle of nowhere, forced to
create a new society.

204
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,202
To succeed, you must not only
survive the elements, but each

205
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,561
other.

206
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,833
Loudmouth, Sue.

Yeah, Sean, get some b...

208

Grouch, B.B.

209
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,540
Grouch, probably me.

Jerri.

214
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,446
The grouch would have to be
Jerri.

215
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,682
No idea.

216

PROBST: One of the keys to

241
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,052
competing on<i> Survivor</i> is
understanding alliances: how

242
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:29,121
they form, when they shift, and
who you can trust.

243
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,064
You can actually win
<i>Survivor</i> without having a

244
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,967
single survival skill if you
have the best friendships.

245
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,276
When you're out there, you
don't have a lot of time to

246
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:43,741
figure out if<i> this</i> is the person
you want to be your friend.

247
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,854
As soon as I got on the
island, it was, like, "Okay, who

248
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:50,949
can I team up with here?"
Me and Joel pretty much wanted

249
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,085
to play the game the same way
and win it the same way.

250
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,164
It was, like, "Look, you never
vote for me and I will never

251
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,155
vote for you."

252
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,824
It was that simple, we got to
look out for each other.

253
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,794
Cool, it's a done deal.

254
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,930
The night Joel got voted off,
I cried.

255
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,699
PROBST: The tribe has spoken.

256
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,217
It just hurt so bad, because
that was the last guy on team

257
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,608
Gervase.

258
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,943
I was just in shock.

259
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:27,012
I'm, like, "What the hell am I
gonna do now?"

260
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,954
The bottom line is, the
people that lasted the longest

261
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,168
are the people that have the
best friendships or the best

262
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,490
alliances.

263
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,828
Colby and I had a very strong
bond.

264
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,396
My only loyalty is to Tina.

265
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,097
There's no other loyalty for me.

266
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:45,503
We made an alliance that it
would be he and I till the end.

267
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:53,044
I made one alliance out there
and that... one true alliance.

268
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,146
We're both, you know, really
hardworking.

269
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,447
We're both very outdoorsy.

270
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,983
We just got along.

271
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,227
I thought I could trust her all
the way to the end, because she

272
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,361
was a lot of fun.

273
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:18,369
She reminded me of, like, a
younger sister.

274
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:22,673
So, about day five... and I'm not
stupid... Richard approaches me

275
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,175
and corners me.

276
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,910
Okay, so here's the deal.

277
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,213
He gives me his rhetoric why
me and him should align, because

278
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:34,685
we're both the biggest creeps on
the island, and... and

279
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,955
everybody's not going to like
us, but if we team up together

280
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,624
and go down to the final two,
they're going to have to pick

281
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,993
between one of us idiots.

282
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,073
So I'm, like, okay, I'm going to
bull... him, so I lied my

283
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,429
ass off to Richard.

284
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,899
So then I told Kelly, I said,
"Me and you," I said, "at the

285
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,801
end are just going to burn
Richard's butt, the three of us

286
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,369
against the world."

287
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,272
(chuckling)
Friendships are very

288
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:05,249
superficial out there, so it's
rare that you build a friendship

289
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:13,224
that's as deep maybe as Rodger
and Elisabeth.

290
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,327
I think this situation
genuinely happened.

291
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,395
These are two wonderful people.

292
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,633
This is the scene where I
actually gave Elisabeth the rock

293
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,367
to take home to her boyfriend,
Tim.

294
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,914
And I found a little rock out
here about that tall, shaped

295
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,305
like a heart.

296
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,472
He said, "Here you go.

297
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,885
What's that look like?"
And I said, "A heart."

298
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,754
He said, "You take that with
you, give it to your boyfriend

299
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,978
when you get back."

300
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:42,047
Elisabeth always reminded me
of my daughter out there.

301
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,590
If somebody would have told me
that I would have went out there

302
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,526
and became friends, especially
with a young lady 30 years

303
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,763
younger than me, and best
friends, and still are best

304
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,942

told them that... that they were

305
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,833
crazy.

306
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,535
It matters so much to me that
he's around, so I'm not writing

307
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,739
his name down. Uh-uh.

308
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,476
I will not spell that man's
name.

309
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,945
I didn't come away with the
$1 million.

310
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:12,416
Uh, I did come away with a
friend for life.

311
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,766
And if I had to choose between
the two, I think I would...

312
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,753
I would take the-the
friendship over the... over the

313
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,656
money.

314
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,557
This served them well.

315
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,192
It definitely did.

316
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,438
The two good people came
together, and they were a power

317
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,564
of one.

318
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,536
There are bound to be fights
in this game.

319
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,839
I mean, you almost can't avoid
them.

320
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,442
All right, who did it?

321
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,576
Who did it?!

322
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,511
Who counted that chicken before
it hatched?!

323
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,146
I'm tired of you and the...

324
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,347
chicken!

325
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,827
(rooster crows)
When it comes to the fighting

326
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,917
thing...

327
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,429
(bell clangs)
every day there's something

328
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,497
that's going to get to you.

329
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,489
Let go of the chicken thing.

330
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,158
It was 110 during the day.

331
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,061
You're hot, you're cold, you're
tired, you're wet.

332
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,063
(thunder crashes)
Do you have some kind of a

333
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,397
problem?

334
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,576
Yeah, I have a problem with
your attitude.

335
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,733
Oh, really?

336
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,902
What the hell is up<i> your</i> butt?

337
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,304
You first have to evaluate
your position in the game.

338
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:11,008
And you have to choose who
you're going to start a fight

339
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,009
with and who you're not.

340
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,544
I'm not eating mammal.

341
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm not eating fowl.

342
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,726
We clashed from the very
beginning, but we were able to

343
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,683
keep a lid on it the whole time.

344
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,784
Right, right.

345
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,096
We kind of... we kind
of... we'd...

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,386
Controlled it. Right.

347
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,799
Bite our tongues and just
kind of be, like, okay.

348
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:24,755
I think that she and I are both
very, like, strong-willed

349
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,891
individuals.

350
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,125
That's all I was saying.

351
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,138
It's a good thing just to break
it up when it's...

352
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,797
You are the defensive one
about the chickens, not me, so

353
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,498
do not yell at me about the
chickens.

354
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,267
I am not getting emotionally
attached.

355
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,636
You can get as emotionally
attached as you want to.

356
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,105
The only reason we said it is
because we care about your

357
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,174
feelings since you are a part of
this tribe.

358
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,476
But don't jump all over me,
sweetheart.

359
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,243
I tried!
But you mumbled!

360
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,378
Look... you...

361
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,915
You mumbled... mumbled under
your breath.

362
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,183
That's it.

363
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,151
Uh-oh, look at Mike.

364
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,386
That was Jeff.

365
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,253
That was Mike.

366
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,588
That was Jeff.

367
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,824
I would go to Kimmi, and I
would bitch about Alicia.

368
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,826
And I'd go to Alicia and I'd
bitch about Kimmi.

369
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,427
See me walking away?

370
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,163
I helped instigate it.

371
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,509
I was so happy, I walked away
from it just thrilled,

372
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,799
because...

373
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,046
here it was on a silver platter,
exactly what I wanted, and it

374
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,336
was beautiful.

375
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,437
Jeff did it.

376
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,772
He's good at it.

377
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,508
(laughs): He manipulated
everybody.

378
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,943
That was totally not cool.

379
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,178
No I don't think that was good.

380
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,080
I'd like to kill that guy.

381
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,917
Anything that you can do to
cause trouble offers up another

382
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,119
situation that you can take
advantage of in some way.

383
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,286
Here it was.

384
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,622
But don't jump all over me,
sweetheart.

385
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,002
Don't wave your finger in my
face.

386
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,825
I will always wave my finger...

387
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,094
It's the rhythm of the head
and the finger.

388
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,695
That's the trick behind it.

389
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,299
You know? It's not enough to
shake your head, 'cause

390
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,234
that's... whatever.

391
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,336
The finger is, like, "eh."

392
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,484
You know, it's like your teacher
in school does that.

393
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,708
But the head<i> and</i> the finger,
that's... that's big-time.

394
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,909
My vote is for Kimmi.

395
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,946
This really should be Alicia,
but...

396
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,089
Things are falling apart here
at Rattana Beach.

397
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,659
You told me you were going to
align with us, because Colleen

398
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,360
told me that.

399
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,663
That's bull...
People change, actually,

400
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,031
during the game.

401
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,868
Is that a good thing, to change
yourself during the game?

402
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,235
Um, not really.

403
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,436
Well, I don't give a...

404
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,916
because I trust her more than I
trust you. Why?

405
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,638
I'm, like, Kelly's telling
the other team that she's not on

406
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,209
the alliance.

407
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,210
That's bull...

408
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,879
I've been your friend since day
one.

409
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,580
Nope. I'm going fishing.

410
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,016
So now all of a sudden, I'm
two-faced and I... her when

411
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,896
she had approached me and said,
"Hey, Rich and I have formed an

412
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,886
alliance."

413
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,856
It's just, she was accusing me
of doing something that she

414
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,725
herself had done.

415
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,326
You know what I mean?

416
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,128
Like, I just wanted to talk to
her.

417
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,597
I just wanted to talk to her and
clear the air.

418
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,264
That's bull...

419
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,433
Will you talk to me?

420
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,567
No.

421
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,968
I don't have to.

422
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,071
So then I was, like, my friend's
gone, I'm all alone in this

423
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,260
game, and I don't give a...

424
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:55,906
no more.

425
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,474
So I blew Kelly off.

426
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,779
That little tiff between
Kelly and Sue has been coming

427
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,313
and plays to my advantage.

428
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,448
Absolutely.

429
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,517
Divide and conquer.

It's inevitable that a fight

432
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,290
I mean, every alliance has to
fracture, and that's just the

466
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:49,854
come up.

467
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,723
In real life, people use sex
as a weapon.

468
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,660
Why not translate that to out
there?

469
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:00,131
I definitely came into the
game thinking to myself that

470
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,601
there might be the option as a
strategy to befriend someone of

471
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,971
the male species.

472
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,609
(laughs): And then... in walks
Colby.

473
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,446
I had a discussion with Colby
regarding chocolate and how

474
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:20,685
chocolate releases the same
endorphins that sex does.

475
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,653
Peppermint patty!

476
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,833
This fantasy I have about
chocolate and sex definitely

477
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,790
involves him.

478
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:29,393
Hot fudge dripping all over the
top!

479
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,696
They're driving me nuts.

480
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,397
I can't take it anymore!

481
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,877
I may be a lot of things, but
I ain't no Hershey bar.

482
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,469
(laughs)
It's all about sex when we go

483
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,438
off.

484
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:45,976
So we like to play together,
not as a romantic situation.

485
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,646
Romance, you know, Jerri and
Colby played a little game back

486
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,393
and forth with one another,
but nothing happened.

487
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,650
And, you know, you're not
bathing, you're not brushing

488
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,119
your teeth.

489
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,165
It's just the thought of getting
intimate like that with somebody

490
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,189
who's nasty and laying in dirt.

491
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,959
It ain't cute.

492
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:05,262
PROBST: From the beginning to
the end of the<i> Survivor</i>

493
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,799
experience, food plays a huge
role.

494
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,501
Sometimes it's a matter of what
you're willing to eat, sometimes

495
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,272
it's what you can find to eat,
but ultimately, it's how tough

496
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:23,341
you are when there's almost
nothing to eat.

497
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,020
<i>Survivor: Africa,</i> here's my
advice to you: tell yourself in

498
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,266
the beginning, "I'm going to be
eating things I don't want to

499
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,589
eat.

500
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,670
I'm going to have to be eating
things that I don't normally

501
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:35,626
think of as food."

502
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,628
It depends on what you got to
eat.

503
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,066
If it's an eyeball, I think I'd
try swallowing it.

504
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,067
I can't see chewing an eyeball.

505
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:50,341
(laughs)
(cheers, applause, whooping)

506
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,676
I'm not doing it.

507
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,388
That's the only thing going
through my head is, "I'm not

508
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,711
doing this."

509
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,992
I knew everybody on my team
was gonna eat this except for

510
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,916
me, so I had to do it, you know?

511
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,252
And you didn't want to let your
team down.

512
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,190
This is for immunity, so this is
huge right now, and, uh...

513
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,658
I just did it, you know?

514
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,493
And I can't believe I did now.

515
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,662
I mean...

516
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,597
(laughs): I can't believe I just
did that.

517
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,767
I would eat a bucket of bugs
before I'd eat anything that the

518
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,670
<i>Survivor II</i> people ate.

519
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,072
This is horrible.

520
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,851
This is, like, the worst thing
in the whole world, because I

521
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:28,712
told my tribe mates I would eat
anything except the cow brain.

522
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:33,183
And wouldn't you know it.

523
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,752
(disgusted groans, yells)
The brain.

524
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,454
Got flies all over it.

525
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,592
If you think it's disgusting,
you got to weigh... weigh it

526
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,927
against getting kicked off the
island.

527
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,696
You got to eat it.

528
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,532
Can't do it.

529
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,801
Sorry.

530
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,270
This was very hard knowing
that you're disappointing

531
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:58,309
everybody.

532
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,512
Kimmi made a choice, and that
choice you could say cost her a

533
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,282
million dollars.

534
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,554
PROBST: It's time for you to
go.

535
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,257
There's a lot of factors
involved in this game that I

536
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,492
just did not...

537
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,830
expect or... plan for.

538
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:27,899
You know, the starvation aspect
of it was just horrifying.

539
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,989
I mean, every day I'm
getting weaker instead of

540
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:38,214
stronger, and that's a bad
thing.

541
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,650
You were just sapped of all
of your energy.

542
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,954
I mean, you have, you can't even
row the raft anymore.

543
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,455
You can't walk up hills anymore.

544
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,923
You know, we're starving.

545
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,860
We haven't eaten in 24 hours and
we had a lot to do and no

546
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,662
energy, none.

547
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,532
Everyone here was just in slow
motion.

548
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,002
If we don't catch our food,
we won't be eating any food.

549
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,704
There's a pig in the water.

550
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,171
A pig?

551
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,306
Yeah.

552
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,442
There is a pig, right over
there!

553
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,512
Oh, God, Mike's going with the
knife.

554
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:35,939
If you are the food gatherer,
you become quite important.

555
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,909
This is a game called
<i>Survivor,</i> and we're all

556
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,645
starving, and believe you me, if
that pig had gotten anywhere

557
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,358
near me when I was out there, I
would have killed it with my

558
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,249
bare hands.

559
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,718
I wouldn't have even needed a
knife.

560
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,051
It's good, right?

561
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,397
I feel better about my
position now that I've made this

562
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,223
kill.

563
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,894
I think my position in the tribe
has come up a few levels, and...

564
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,262
it's a good feeling.

565
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,650
You just put that on your face?

566
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,998
Yeah, he did, just like that.

567
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,399
We're gonna get strong now.

568
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,202
That was part of the reason
why we kept winning all those

569
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,705
challenges, because we kept
eating.

570
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,817
We heard a rumor that the
other team caught fish with

571
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,253
their spear.

572
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,334
And that does worry me a
little bit, because they are

573
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,656
going to be eating some protein.

574
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,436
We did a competition where
they won a spear, so we knew

575
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,429
they had to be catching
something.

576
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,469
(laughter, excited shouting)
Watch the spear.

577
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,305
My position with the tribe,
it's probably going to increase

578
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,673
as a result of this.

579
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,142
I could eat rice for 17 more
days.

580
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,656
I could eat rice the whole time,
but they're loving the fish and

581
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,579
it seems to make people feel
great.

582
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,559
And I squeeze every ounce of
credit out of it that I can.

583
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:58,789
(laughs)
They're pretty damn tasty.

584
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,157
Thank you.

585
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:00,724
You just need to keep me and
I'll provide you with all the

586
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,726
fish you need.

587
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,763
Did that play a role in
Richard staying with us for a

588
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,298
long time?

589
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,699
Absolutely.

590
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,344
And when we would see them at
the next competition, they'd

591
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,401
brag about it.

592
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,003
"We're eating fish."

593
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,115
You know, it's psychological
now.

594
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,183
They're getting into our heads.

595
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,207
"We're eating fish.

596
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,676
What are you guys eating?"
"Uh, rats."

597
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,411
I really didn't want to eat
the rats.

598
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,017
You get, like, 52 grams of
protein off of a ounce of rat.

599
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:31,655
This is some of the best
stuff... (laughing)

600
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:35,526
I ever had in my life.

601
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,595
The people on<i> Survivor:
Africa</i> are going to find out,

602
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,698
if you see a tribe figuring out
how to catch food and one tribe

603
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,702
not, you are going to see an
unbelievable advantage both

604
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,339
mentally and physically.

605
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,145
The only way to win this game
is to have a lot of luck.

606
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,248
You know, luck has got to be
smiling upon you that day,

607
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:02,453
because anything can happen.

608
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,032
Fate plays a big part, luck
plays a big part, you know,

609
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,257
and...

610
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:11,662
the gods that be can vote you
off, too.

611
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,465
(Mike yells)
Get some water.

612
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,367
You okay?

613
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:21,004
(yells) >> Oh, my God!

614
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,718
He's burnt, he's burnt pretty
bad, Jerri.

615
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:23,640
Here's some water.

616
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,041
Get in the water.

617
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,578
The secret to winning this
game is to physically not hurt

618
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,614
yourself so you have to be taken
out.

619
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,961
He passed out and fell in the
fire.

620
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,145
He passed out in the fire.

621
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:38,021
Stay in the water, stay in
the water.

622
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,861
Oh, my God!

623
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,006
Do you want me to come in
with you, Mike, and swim with

624
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,563
you?

625
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,264
You passed out?

626
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,235
I was blowing on the fire and
the smoke went right in my face,

627
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,337
and I inhaled it...

628
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,172
and I passed out.

629
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,677
(groaning)
Look at these things.

630
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,011
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

631
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,447
Keep your hands in the water.

632
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,992
I can't decide whether I
should keep trying to bend them

633
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,383
or not.

634
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,453
No don't, no, don't.

635
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
No, no, Mike, Mike.

636
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:13,390
(yelling)
Don't even look at it.

637
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,491
Don't even look at it.

638
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,092
It's just going to make you feel
worse.

639
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,628
Was he bent over working on
the fire?

640
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,598
The day that this happened,
it just changed it all.

641
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,369
In a weird sense, I think I gave
up.

642
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,905
In a weird sense, I think I gave
up.

643
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,307
(yelling)
Fate plays a huge role in

644
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,577
<i>Survivor.</i>

645
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:36,513
It doesn't matter how great of a
player you are.

646
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,449
It doesn't matter if you are a
master strategist.

647
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,985
I have no doubt in my mind that
I would not have won had Mike

648
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,187
not fallen in the fire.

649
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,288
Just right before that we'd
been out fishing.

650
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,625
Mike and myself had formed an
alliance, and we had it figured

651
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,695
where it would be Mike and
Elisabeth and myself in the

652
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,530
final three.

653
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,766
And, of course, then Mike comes
right back to camp, and within

654
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,403
ten minutes of being back in
camp he falls in the fire.

655
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,808
There goes the alliance out the
door, and so that was definitely

656
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,945
<i>the</i> turning point for me
personally out there.

657
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,581
It goes to show you that no
matter how well that you plan

658
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,518
things and no matter what your
strategy is out there, you can

I love you guys!

But first, four more castaways
from<i> Survivor: Africa.</i>

665
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,812
Kim Johnson, a retired teacher,
the mother of three and

666
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,315
grandmother of two, from
Oyster Bay, New York.

667
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,719
I want to be there, I want to
kick that young butt, I want to

668
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,321
play the game and I want to win
the friggin' million dollars.

669
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,789
And I can do it.

670
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,759
PROBST: Brandon Quinton, a
bartender from Dallas, Texas.

671
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,493
I would be a great contestant.

672
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,739
Nobody would suspect me and I
would totally win the million

673
00:29:58,763 --> 00:29:59,930
dollars.

674
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,532
And look around... I could
totally use it.

675
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,669
PROBST: Diane Ogden, a mail
carrier and the mother of two

676
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,236
from Lincoln, Nebraska.

677
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,273
You know, Diane Ogden, what
you see is what you get.

678
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,742
And you won't be disappointed.

679
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,077
I can hunt, I can cook, I can
fish.

680

PROBST: And Kim Powers, a
freelance marketer from

681
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,514
Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.

682
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,852
You asked if we had any body
art or tattoos, and I do.

683
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,820
I have a small red rose tattoo.

684
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:31,889
But you have to put me on the
show to find out where it is.

685
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:37,000
PROBST: No one comes away
from<i> Survivor</i> without a few

686
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,672
insights into what it takes to
outwit, outplay and outlast the

687
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,408
competition.

688
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,179
The secret to winning
<i>Survivor</i> is...

689
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,547
Be flexible.

690
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,283
The less you stand out, the
less people are noticing the

691
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,918
things you do.

692
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,187
You have to have the best
relationships.

693
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,856
Emotional detachment and
never giving up.

694
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,759
Eat a lot, and have weight to
actually lose.

695
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,039
Be a contributor, but not a
dominator.

696
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,662
(laughs): Lie.

697
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,298
Fake it.

698
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,433
Work hard.

699
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:10,834
Be low-key.

700
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,970
Definitely have to be in
pretty good physical condition.

701
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,439
Don't piss anybody off.

702
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,673
Don't trust anybody.

703
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,243
Just make sure that you're
true to yourself.

704
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,544
You have to be yourself.

705
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,681
The secret to winning
<i>Survivor</i> is luck.

706
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,850
PROBST: Okay, you've made it.

707
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,052
You're one of the final few.

708
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,654
Here's your reward.

709
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:34,258
Now that you're feeling at your
very worst, you need to be at

710
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,827
your very best.

711
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,897
Ten more days, and it'll
all be over.

712
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,634
I'll probably never see these
people again.

713
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,402
That's the way I want it.

714
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:50,774
Lost some weight, I've lost
some muscle, I've lost quite a

715
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:53,176
hunk of sanity.

716
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,880
There is nothing that's firm
on this body anymore.

717
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,248
Basically, I'm a physical wreck.

718
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,251
Why am I here?

719
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,319
Why am I putting myself through
this?

720
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:07,624
God, this sucks.

721
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:12,929
33 days out on an island, and
it's just hitting the fan now.

722
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,397
This is really horrible.

723
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,901
Today is raining, last night
was raining, and I think

724
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:22,472
tomorrow it will probably be
raining.

725
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,175
You're sick and tired of
being sick and tired.

726
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:31,114
And at this point, you start
existing rather than living.

727
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:36,887
Living here day to day, those
are the real challenges.

728
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,656
The environment and the
elements here have probably been

729
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:42,325
the most dominant player in this
game.

730
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:47,264
You've got the 17th player here,
and it's the environment.

731
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:51,969
Oh, boy, here comes the flood.

732
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:55,639
Our entire campsite was
washed out.

733
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,845
Our rice is gone, our knives
are gone.

734
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,581
We were just sick.

735
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,217
It was just, like, how much more
can we take?

736
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,553
We have no food.

737
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,287
I know, none.

738
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,691
We have no food.

739
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,494
So I just walked the
riverbank and realized that on

740
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,697
the other side, our tin of food
was there.

741
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,409
And, Keith, how do you think
you're going to get it back

742
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,234
across?

743
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,004
Very dangerous thing that he
did here, very dangerous.

744
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:31,641
Keith was crossing at an
extremely dangerous point.

745
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,442
Keith.

746
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,843
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

747
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,757
They weren't sure he was
going to be able to make it, so

748
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,614
Tina just went and took an
alternate route.

749
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,751
If you can't bring it all,
just bring one plastic bag of it

750
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,185
over or something.

751
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,566
If there was one thing that,
for me personally, that I came

752
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:53,590
away with, is the fact that the
show is very, very real.

753
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:55,965
Okay.

754
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,367
Hello, family. Doing good.

755
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,803
I love you guys.

756
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,582
PROBST: Is that a little tear
in your eye?

757
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:06,342
Yes, sir, it is.

758
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,878
My mom just said, "Hi, baby."

759
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,448
One of the hardest parts
about the whole<i> Survivor</i>

760
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,052
experience is being away from
your family.

761
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,554
That's... that's what I
needed, right there.

762
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:24,727
There's no emotion that this
game doesn't touch in any way.

763
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:28,798
The lesson to new Survivors
is, this game of<i> Survivor</i> is not

764
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,869
about building huts and catching
fish, it's a game of people

765
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,738
playing against people.

766
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,405
PROBST: Survivors, ready.

767
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,874
For immunity.

768
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,942
Go!

769
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,725
This immunity challenge is
such a double-edged sword for

770
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,816
me.

771
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:47,317
PROBST: Immunity.

772
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,317
Sweet!

773
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:51,654
The moment you lose, you're
going.

774
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,088
PROBST: Give me a big hug!

775
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,558
Baby!

776
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:59,762
I knew the only way that I
was going to get to day 39 was

777
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:03,266
with this little thing around my
neck.

778
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,436
And that's the best thing
about this game is...

779
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,239
situations happen every second
of every day, but you have to be

780
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,908
smart enough to see them and
take advantage of it.

781
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,945
PROBST: Somebody who has
played this game for 41 days is

782
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,648
about to be voted out.

783
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,918
It's Keith.

784
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,788
Everybody wonders why Colby
kept me instead of Keith.

785
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,968
You know, they thought that was
a very poor strategic move on

786
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,859
his part.

787
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,672
That decision proves that
this game is not about a million

788
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,365
dollars.

789
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:39,669
PROBST: Keith, the tribe has
spoken.

790
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,505
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

791
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,775
If he had picked Keith to stay
with him instead of Tina, it

792
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:46,742
would have been a unanimous
vote, and Colby would be a

793
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,979
millionaire.

794
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:52,182
Period. End of story.

795
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,119
It meant more to Colby that
our friendship and him sticking

796
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,865
to his word... that meant more to
him than winning a million

797
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,390
dollars.

798
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,829
PROBST: It's now time for our
final vote.

799
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,498
Rodger, we'll start with you.

800
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,568
In the end of this game, the
final two standing, the one that

801
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:15,238
everyone respects the most is
the one who's going to win.

802
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:18,441
PROBST: In true<i> Survivor</i>
tradition, it comes down to one

803
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,376
final vote.

804
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,979
I personally felt like Colby
deserved to win and that the

805
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,714
whole jury would feel that way.

806
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:29,819
I never allowed myself to think,
"Well, Tina, what if?"

807
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:34,524
(cheers and applause)
And Colby's, like, "Get up,

808
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,093
you won!

809
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,029
Come on, get up, come on."

810
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:43,900
Our friendship was worth more to
him than money.

811
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,338
That means the world to me.

812
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,374
PROBST: When we come back,
the winner of<i> Survivor: the</i>

813
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,477
<i>Australian Outback,</i> Tina
Wesson, and a look ahead at

814
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,679
<i>Survivor: Africa.</i>

815
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,849
But now let's meet the rest of
our newest Survivors.

816
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:02,819
Lindsey Richter, an advertising
account executive from Portland,

817
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,453
Oregon.

818
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,854
I think I can.

819
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,855
I think I can.

820
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,658
I know I can. Whoo-whoo! Ha!

821
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,395
PROBST: Linda Spencer, a
career counselor and a mother of

822
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,897
two from Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

823
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,200
My motto: Life, the ultimate
adventure.

824
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,737
I think it's about ten degrees
out here.

825
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,205
I'm very strong-willed.

826
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,140
Most importantly, I get the
game.

827
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,843
I understand the social
politics.

828
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,645
PROBST: Lex Van Den Berghe, a
marketing manager and the father

829
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,148
of two from Santa Cruz,
California.

830
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,683
One, two, three, four!

831
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,886
If I got to go digging in the
dirt with my bare hands, looking

832
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:40,357
for a worm, I'm going to do it.

833
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,892
PROBST: And Ethan Zohn, a
professional soccer player from

834
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,828
Lexington, Massachusetts.

835
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,129
I love Tina.

836
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,032
I thought she was hot.

837
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,336
(shouts)
PROBST: Joining us now is

838
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,478
Tina Wesson, winner of
<i>Survivor: The Australian</i>

839
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,613
<i>Outback.</i>

840
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,183
Having gone through this once
yourself and having done very

841
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:10,553
well, and seeing 16 people now
ready to do it again, would you

842
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,155
do it again?

843
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,656
Absolutely not.

844
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:14,323
PROBST: No.

845
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,725
No, I would not.

846
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,228
But if I did do it again, I
would play the game differently,

847
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,195
even though I won.

848
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,663
PROBST: Why?

849
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,844
Well, I think that if you're
playing the game just to go have

850
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,100
an adventure is one thing.

851
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:27,070
But now, as the game's
progressing, people are getting

852
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,282
smarter, and so you have to play
the game smarter in order to

853
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,340
win.

854
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,553
PROBST: Well, we talked to
some tribe members to see what

855
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,821
qualities you had that allowed
you to win.

856
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,189
Take a look at this and then
we'll get your reaction.

857
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,813
Okay.

858
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,282
She's a soccer mom.

859
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:43,486
Who would bet on the soccer mom,
when she is faced with guys who

860
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,356
are literally chiseled from
stone?

861
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,435
(yelling)
I would not have predicted Tina

862
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,759
at all.

863
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,360
She stayed under the radar.

864
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,297
She hasn't, you know, thrown in
your face that she's a tough

865
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,765
woman, but she was.

866
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,111
You're going to try to cross
this current?

867
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,467
You're crazy.

868
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:00,882
No matter how many men were
out there with Tina, Tina had

869
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,405
the biggest... out there.

870
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:06,743
Tina has this very sweet,
genteel Southern mother...

871
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,210
You go, girl.

872
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,692
"Everybody just loves me, and
I just love everybody," and you

873
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,782
know, give me a break.

874
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,718
She's brilliant, that's a smart
woman, and she'll chop your head

875
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,552
off in a second.

876
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,954
Maralyn and I have bonded.

877
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,657
We saw her stab several
people in the back, until she

878
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,169
got into the alliance that she
needed to be in to carry her

879
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,793
through.

880
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:28,564
Tina won the game because she
was everything for everyone.

881
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,699
She was the mother to those that
needed a mother.

882
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,003
Stop it, both of you, or
you're going to time out!

883
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,472
She was the best friend to
someone who needed the best

884
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,575
friend.

885
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,443
She was there for emotional
support.

886
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:46,749
She was competitive, she was
manipulative, and that's what

887
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:50,419
you have to be to win this game,
period, bottom line.

888
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,891
But she did it with a smile on
her face.

889
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,858
PROBST: Your reactions... are
they accurate in assessing why

890
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,161
you won?

891
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,364
Well, to some degree, but for
me personally, Jeff, I feel like

892
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,533
winning<i> Survivor</i> takes three
things: a little bit of luck, a

893
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,703
little bit of logistics and
strategy, and not rocking the

894
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,974
boat but just getting along.

895
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,609
PROBST: We always say on the
show, surviving the element,

896
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,946
that's one part of it; surviving
the others is the bigger part.

897
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:17,680
Absolutely.

898
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,448
PROBST: True for you?

899
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,549
100% true.

900
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:22,218
PROBST: Let's talk about the
new 16.

901
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,565
You've had a chance to look over
their audition tapes, sort of

902
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,922
assess how you think they're
going to do.

903
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,525
Anybody stand out, maybe people
you like, don't like, who might

904
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,127
do well, who might not do well?

905
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,436
Well, I picked two people who
were game-savvy in their

906
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,864
audition tapes.

907
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,011
I thought that these guys, they
kind of know what's going on.

908
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,334
And that's Clarence Black.

909
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,371
You know, he seems like, you
know, "I'm going to say what I

910
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,740
need to say in order to make
friends."

911
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:44,741
You know, very strategic.

912
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,708
PROBST: And what's...

913
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,577
what's... why is that important?

914
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,712
Don't people see through that,
figure that out?

915
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,014
Not if they're good at it.

916
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,650
You know, take Richard Hatch,
for instance, you know?

917
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,285
He played everybody on that
show, and they didn't even know

918
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,954
it... till after it was over.

919
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:58,955
PROBST: Okay.

920
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,456
And that's how Clarence is to
me.

921
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:04,560
Lindsey Richter: I feel as if
she's just a very intimidating,

922
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,328
Alicia-type person, you know.

923
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,666
She comes across as very strong
physically, and she... it's like

924
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,845
she has this mental knowledge,
you know, "I'm going to go out

925
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,235
there and I'm going to kick
butt."

926
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,805
And she's a strong woman, and I
think she has potential to do

927
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,206
very well.

928
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,286
PROBST: Last tip before we go
for somebody watching this.

929
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,178
Is there anything they should
look for when they're watching

930
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,247
the show, a tip that might help
them figure out...?

931
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,494
Well one thing, Jeff, I'm
going to be looking at is I'm

932
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,151
going to be watching behind the
scenes.

933
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,154
Whenever they show people at
camp, who's sitting next to each

934
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:36,292
other, whenever they're walking
to challenge together, who's

935
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:37,660
walking next to each other?

936
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,940
You know, I want to know who's
really friends, who's really

937
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,263
bonding out there.

938
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,232
PROBST: Tina, thanks for your
insight.

939
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:49,572
And now, a look ahead at
<i>Survivor: Africa.</i>

940
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:54,510
Next week, an all-new adventure
begins when our 16 strangers are

941
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,713
abandoned in a landscape unlike
any the previous Survivors have

942
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,650
faced.

943
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,820
Diane was the one in charge
of the map, which I would say

944
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,256
was the first issue of our
tribe.

945
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:10,193
I carry mail, so I just kind
of went at my pace, which is

946
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,161
probably faster than most
people.

947
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,129
I just started my period.

948
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,399
No wonder I have cramps!

949
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,502
Excuse me, Africa, you know,
we're not down at the mall here.

950
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:22,605
Frank is like a big strong
ex-army guy.

951
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:24,607
Dude, were not all like you.

952
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,676
Let's do it!

953
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,142
(whooping)
PROBST: Temperatures are

954
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,977
scorching.

955
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,678
Water is scarce.

956
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,114
The water's disgusting, it's
sick.

957
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,449
I mean, I was filling it up.

958
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,551
You get water mixed with crud.

959
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,688
We've got to get water, like,
in the next hour, or we're just

960
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,088
going to be so screwed.

961
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,503
You don't boil your water out
here you end up with anemic

962
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,904
dysentery, which basically has
you puking and crapping your

963
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:47,730
guts out.

964
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,865
PROBST: The dangers are real.

965
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,968
Always keep two people awake
on the lookout for animals that

966
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,104
hunt at night.

967
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,406
(growling)
PROBST: The stakes have

968
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,877
definitely been raised, but the
game and the social politics

969
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,411
remain the same.

970
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,981
We're pissed off, and we now
need to deal with the situation

971
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,016
where we were starting to build
trust.

972
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,462
The trust has been broken, and
it needs to be built from square

973
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,052
one.

974
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:13,122
PROBST: Join us next Thursday
night when it all begins with

975
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,993
the premier episode of
<i>Survivor: Africa.</i>

976
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,963
We'll be right back.

977
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,166
PROBST: That's it for
tonight, but we hope you'll be

978
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:27,737
watching next week when 16
Americans begin a new adventure

979
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,473
on<i> Survivor: Africa.</i>

980
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,841
I'm Jeff Probst.

981
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,377
Good night.

981
00:43:35,305 --> 00:44:35,792
