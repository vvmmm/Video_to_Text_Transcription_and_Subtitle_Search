00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,513
Hey! You!

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,598
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,717
What's all this for?

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,006
We was done last week.
Why us again?

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,841
Quit moaning, Harry.

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,574
You. Out.

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,444
Move!

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,609
Sorry, Mr. Jackson.
Just saying hello.

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,812
Right, that's it.
Get this lot packed up.

10
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,378
Get sorted.

11
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,287
What have you got
with you, then?

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,518
Any money?
Phone cards?

13
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,617
Have you got stuff
you can trade, have you?

14
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,820
Bastards.

15
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,887
Right, Brinkley, shut it.

16
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,201
Come on.
Up you get.

17
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,600
Come on. Rise and shine.
The morning's fine.

18
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,504
Let's be having you.

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,702
Let's be having you.
Breakfast is waiting.

20
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,836
Come on, Brian.

21
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,347
Come on, Brian.
Shake a leg.

22
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,349
It's your favorite time of day.

23
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,011
Hey, Dopey. See if you can get
some action out of Sleepy here.

24
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,553
Aw, shut up, Humpty-Dumpty.

25
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,816
Come on, Fisher.
Up you get.

26
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,755
We've got a problem.
Jimmy?

27
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,285
Keep them moving.

28
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,298
Come on.
Up you get.

29
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,229
Fisher.

30
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,770
Fisher, what have you done?

31
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,300
Dear.

32
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,176
One less for breakfast.

33
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,417
Prisoner number 214.

34
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,854
These are Alan Fisher's
documents.

35
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,085
Could you sign him out, please?

36
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,128
Thank you.

37
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,405
You'll be all right, you.

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,838
Rastaface.

39
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,341
Hey.
I'm talking to you.

40
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,207
You want to go back
to punishment, Braithwaite?

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,438
Any time you want, sooty.
Any time.

42
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,060
He's a pain
in the arse, is Braithwaite.

43
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,212
It's all these tip-offs.
I'm sure it's him.

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,397
- Anything for aggravation.
- Hey, Jackson.

45
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,890
You like working
with the blacks, do you?

46
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,803
- Get him in.
- Hey, Jackson.

47
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,886
Can't smell that.

48
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,862
Can you?

49
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,229
- I've got the gym.
- Shut up, Braithwaite!

50
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,528
Snoopy.

51
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,561
In you go, son.

52
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,105
Tell you what. Send the golliwog
down to the gym.

53
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,916
I'll leave the weights.
I'll work out on him.

54
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,704
Shut it!

55
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,878
Come on. Back inside.
Come on.

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,711
See this?
Found it under your table.

57
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,082
Hm.
Well, you could've fooled me.

58
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,479
I don't use that, you know.

59
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,922
I never see that thing before
in my life.

60
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,324
What wrong with you, brother?

61
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,056
I'm not your brother.

62
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,292
You want to bet?

63
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,299
All I am saying, Mr. Bunny,

64
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,699
is that somebody should have
given me prior warning.

65
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,398
Ms. Hewitt,
you will receive notification

66
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,303
as soon as I receive it myself.

67
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,433
I've had the testing trial
for weeks.

68
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,068
- Is that the official date?
- Yes.

69
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,738
Well, when it <i>is</i> confirmed,
please let me know.

70
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,813
Thank you.

"Statement of next stage
of Margate testing.

72
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,083
Prison Services today issued
to governors a preliminary list

73
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,352
of which...
For which one or two prisons

74
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,224
will be selected
for privatization.

75
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,786
Prisons listed for possible
privatization...

76
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,628
Aylesbury, Coldingley..."
We're not listed.

77
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,897
Next page, Gary.

78
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,664
It's been decided
that nine adult male prisons

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,005
be subjected to detailed
qualitative analysis.

80
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,568
Barfield is first on the list.

81
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,046
Already contracted out
are Wolds,

82
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,413
Blakenhurst, and Doncaster.

83
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,078
Any word on changing
the official category?

84
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,087
I mean, is this an A
or a B nick?

85
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,248
We'll be assessed on performance
to date.

86
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,986
Home Office have requested
details of escapes, assaults,

87
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,322
prisoner activities.

88
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,260
It's no wonder
we're top of the list.

89
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,390
And Fisher topping himself
wasn't good timing.

90
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,867
He had high alcohol content
in his blood.

91
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,426
I know.

92
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,597
And as if that weren't enough.

93
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,336
I just got these.

94
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,741
The date to open up to full
capacity is yet to be confirmed,

95
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,405
but we've been instructed
to stand by.

96
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,645
So it's any day as from now,
Gary.

97
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,844
Crazy.

98
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,113
Right.

99
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,482
Anything come up from
the strip search this morning?

100
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,016
Yeah. We found a condom
in Oswald Snooper's cell.

101
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,563
Norman Jones is back
on the wing.

102
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,223
There's nowhere else to put him.

103
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,631
He should be transferred
to a psychiatric hospital.

104
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,363
I'm pushing for a place
at Broadmoor.

105
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,904
- Anything else?
- That's it.

106
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,599
Well, with their rate
of suicides,

107
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,937
I'd say we might get lucky.

108
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:37,976
Mavis?

109
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,004
Last night, I went
into the maintenance department

110
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,357
and asked them to check
all the garbage

111
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,610
chucked from the cell windows.

112
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,877
Found five more condoms.

113
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,111
Oop.

114
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,362
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.

115
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,513
Morning, ma'am.

116
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,250
We are up for an in-depth
performance analysis.

117
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,419
I do not think that possession
of condoms is my main concern.

118
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,486
Anthony Kelly's on heroin.

119
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,933
I want to see him.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,628
On you go, John.

121
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,201
You know anything about
these privately run prisons?

122
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,037
No.
Only what I've read about them.

123
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,041
Officer Harris.

124
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,319
A lot of teething problems.

125
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,743
Governor.

126
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,008
Gate 2 opening.

127
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,779
A bit slow off the mark,
aren't they?

128
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,596
Have you got to wait
at every gate this long?

129
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,282
Governor, Officer Udding,
Gate 1.

130
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,381
- What's the delay?
- Gate 1 opening.

131
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,860
That's right, Mr. Kelly.
You just keep on smiling.

132
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,469
But I'm warning you...

133
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,948
If you're found with drugs
in your possession...

134
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,565
I know the new regulations.

135
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,700
An extra 21 days.

136
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,538
You want a urine sample?

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,449
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

138
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,611
If I can lose Monday
and Tuesday, that's nice.

139
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,685
Thursday and Friday...
even better.

140
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,932
What have I got to lose?

141
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,459
Your life.

142
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,938
Who gives a shit if I lose that?

143
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,407
I do, Mr. Kelly.

144
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,572
Because while you're here,
you're my responsibility.

little matchstick man, then?

147
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,560
- Harmless little bloke.
- Yeah.

148
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,005
You ought to tell that
to the mothers

149

of the little girls
that he raped and butchered.

No.

00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,294
Nor is that bastard.

162
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,860
He's been asking
for more gym time.

163
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,059
In future, Victor Braithwaite
must be accompanied

164
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,364
by two officers.

165
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,272
I-I <i>was</i> okay.

166
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,432
Maybe you were.

167
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,233
But I wasn't.

168
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,773
Stand by for return.

169
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,249
Governor.

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:10,188
Well, anyway we had
all these big, long sticks,

171
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,193
a-and we stripped them down
of all the bark.

172
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,824
Then we got some string,
a-and we bent safety pins...

173
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,095
You know, fishing rods.

174
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,837
Uh...

175
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,906
It's okay.

176
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,039
Go on.

177
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,672
Oh.

178
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:37,775
And there was this floating,
uh...

179
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,012
What do you call it?
Um...

180
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,553
Turd?

181
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,454
Turd. No.

182
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,884
Come on. Quieten down.

183
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,952
They're all in a queue system,
right?

184
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,227
So if a gate button is pressed
to be opened on E Corridor

185
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,343
and you have four more waiting
up in C, D, and F Wing...

186
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,367
Look, the thing is,

187
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,496
we are gonna have
500 prisoners here any day now.

188
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,336
We have to cut down
on these delays.

189
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:06,039
Um, can you punch up
the sound in chapel there?

190
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,980
Now, does anyone else
have anything to contribute?

191
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,847
What about you, Norman?

192
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,420
My first out-of-body experience.

193
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,823
Experimenting with
hallucinogenic drugs, LSD.

194
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,522
Most people don't understand
what LSD actually does.

195
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,192
It raises the level of vibration

196
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,532
and allows you to exist
on a different plane.

197
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,997
There are lots of
different planes of existence,

198
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,043
different realities.

199
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,342
We all vibrate
on a certain level.

200
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,677
If that level is raised,
everything is heightened.

201
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,854
The physical body
is only one plane of reality.

202
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,017
But we can leave that plane.

203
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,858
Then we have no need
for the physical body.

204
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,060
That's what happens after death.

205
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,765
I understand death.

206
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,307
Okay.

207
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,312
Thank you.

208
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,586
Eric.

209
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,851
What's your favorite memory?

210
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,916
The first time I flew solo.

211
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,894
On a plane, were you?

212
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,487
I was in the RAF.

213
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,054
Followed in me dad's footsteps.

214
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,691
Did you look up to your father?

215
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,395
He's short enough
to look up to anybody.

216
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,801
You done service, have you?

217
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,648
You scummy little git.

218
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,312
- Thank you, Walter.
- You bor...

219
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,341
Oh!

220
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,248
I'm all right.

221
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,052
I'm all right,
and my glasses are all right.

222
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,330
Norman...

223
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,639
if you touch another member
of this group,

224
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,698
you are out.

225
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,440
Is that understood?

226
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,775
Yes, Ms. Collins.

227
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,149
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,380
All right, lads!

229
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,451
Now, these joints are called
tongue-and-groove and dovetail.

230
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,862
You can see here where the
tongue fits into the section.

231
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,425
Now, we'll be fitting
the iron-edged glass

232
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,027
with a glass top.

233
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,937
You see, with this drawer here,

234
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,703
it's simply been
screwed together.

235
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,473
But with the methods
we've been using today,

236
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,573
it shows a genuine craft and a
love for the grain of the wood.

237
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,016
Right, then!

238
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,418
Pack your benches!

239
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,854
Come on!

240
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,415
Pack your benches
and get your overalls off!

241
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,858
Come on, you two.

242
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,271
Stop your nattering
and move along.

243
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,388
Come on.
You do it all day.

244
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,863
Oi!
Get you along.

245
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,955
Come on.
Chop-chop.

246
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,327
Come on.
Move it, will you?

247
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,085
It's not a mothers' meeting.

248
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,042
Move it!

249
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,375
It finish?
Yours stuck up?

250
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,108
Yeah.

251
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,410
If these things spring a leak,

252
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,075
it'll look like
I've pissed myself.

253
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,277
You?

254
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,412
If mine split, I'm gonna look
like Niagara Falls.

255
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,523
Just back me up
for the airport, right?

256
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,117
Come on! Cut the chat!

257
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,095
What about Victor Braithwaite?

258
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,330
I am having that... done
for me.

259
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,458
You understand?

260
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,002
Now, everything is going down
at the same time.

261
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,063
All we have to do is sort out
the kitchen and we're hot.

262
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,199
All right?

263
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,402
Now touch me.

264
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,808
Ooh!

265
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,539
Fool you.

266
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,137
Come on, puppa.

267
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,212
- All right. All right.
- Through the gates.

268
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,412
Watch this now.

269
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,063
Get your watch off, Snoopy.

270
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,420
- He does it every time.
- Keep moving.

271
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,819
Don't overdo it, all right?

272
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,691
Tongue and groove, puppa.
Tongue and groove.

273
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,093
Wolton coming.

274
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,538
He's gone.

275
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,671
Have to be done
down the main kitchens.

276
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,237
We just wheel them
onto the wings.

277
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,511
We don't know which urn
goes onto which wing.

278
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,143
Do one,
got to do them all to make sure.

279
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,458
All right.

280
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,888
And you sort it out with
the others for tomorrow night,

281
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,432
right?

282
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,831
You hear me?

283
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,670
Take my tray.

284
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,269
I'm gonna see you.

285
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,587
Mr. Jackson, sir?

286
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,490
Mr. Jackson.

287
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,392
I want to get a transfer
off the wing, sir.

288
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm getting a lot of aggravation
off of Braithwaite.

289
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,855
You know what I mean?
And that f...

290
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,093
Sorry, sir.

291
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,692
The man is a racist.
You know what I mean, sir?

292
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,704
I can't deal.

293
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,364
I'll put it in my report,
Snoopy.

294
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,907
Come on.
It's time for lockup.

295
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,966
Come on. Chop-chop, lads.
Time for lockup.

296
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,443
Thank you, sir.

297
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,638
Thank you very much.

298
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,408
It's time to lock up!

299
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:19,746
So that's Mr. Andrews,
Mr. Duncan, the area manager,

300
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,084
and Mr. Gordon Keller.

301
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,357
Good God.

302
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,225
Uh, yes, it is.
Thank you.

303
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,764
I was going to pop in
and get some if that's okay.

304
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,231
Yeah. Fine. Fine.

305
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,291
Not for long.

306
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,771
Mavis, would you arrange
security passes

307
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,577
for everyone listed for the day
after tomorrow, please?

308
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,673
Good heavens.

309
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,276
They could've given us
a bit more warning.

310
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,378
Well, the real bigwigs
<i>are</i> coming.

311
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,247
Do you know anyone
called Keller?

312
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,350
- Me?
- No, not you. Gary.

313
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,622
- Do you know?
- Sorry.

314
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,894
We've got 48 hours, Gary.

315
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,602
Barfield's being checked out
day after tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

316
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,410
Every single cell
has been allocated.

317
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,446
House full.

318
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,908
Do you, uh,
need me to stay late?

319
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,009
No.

320
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,280
But, uh, I will need you
tomorrow.

321
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,279
Good night, Gary.

322
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,458
Keller, Gordon...

323
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,826
He's Governor 1 rank overseeing
the main dispersal prisons,

324
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,956
and he's a big union man.

325
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,031
He's publicly spoken out

326
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,568
against the Home Secretary's
privatization announcement.

327
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,898
He's after Barfield.

328
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,579
In the end, they did just use me
as a bloody caretaker.

329
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,376
You've done a damn good job
here.

330
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,886
Thank you, Mavis.
Go on. Go on home.

331
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,861
That husband of yours
will be waiting.

332
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,792
Could you shut the door, please?

333
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,876
I believed
that the loss of freedom

334
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,919
was the ultimate punishment.

335
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,414
I believed
that the loss of freedom

336
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,652
was the ultimate punishment.

337
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,227
Barfield Prison
is now fully operational.

338
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,096
All inmates please check
the bulletin board

339
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,259
for patterning changes.

340
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,270
We have to get that
digga to the kitchen by lunch

341
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,772
so it can be in the tea urns
for tea break.

342
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,967
If your name is not
on the board...

343
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,877
This is it.
Our last chance.

344
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,573
Word is we have a full house.

345
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,514
That means we have to go for it
tonight.

346
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,917
- So, you with me?
- What about Braithwaite?

347
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,978
Tonight.

348
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,921
Thank you, Officer Jackson, sir.

349
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,925
I really appreciate it.
You know what I mean?

350
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,187
Thank you.

351
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,968
Oh, yes.

352
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,866
We're sinking, Mr. Christian!

353
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,529
Mutiny!
You're making the raft...

354
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,665
He's gonna sink the raft.

355
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,036
- Brian.
- Mutiny!

356
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,944
Snoopy's been moved to C Wing.

357
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,573
Victor Braithwaite's
been getting at him.

358
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,880
It took two officers to move
all his stuff...

359
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,479
Tapes, stereos, Game Boys,
shaving cream, hair tonic.

360
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,579
- What?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,267
Not to mention
his Bob Marley memorabilia.

362
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,657
Uh, excuse me.

363
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,620
Your talking
is rather distracting.

364
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,765
But you are welcome to join
the group and participate.

365
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,824
I think I want to stop now.

366
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,392
This... This is stupid now.

367
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,168
This is...
This is bloody, bloody stupid!

368
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Stop now.

369
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,800
It's all right, Walter.
Put the chair down.

370
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,608
- Put the chair down, Walter.
- Put the broom down, Brian.

371
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,858
- It's all right.
- Walter.

372
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,441
Give me the chair.

373
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,849
Go on.

374
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,012
It's all right, Walter.

375
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,327
Does it always hurt you
to remember the fishing trip?

376
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,262
That's okay.

377
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,476
I tried to save him.

378
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,940
I caught his hand.
I-I...

379
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,075
I had hold of him.

380
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,445
But I got scared.

381
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,788
He...
He was trying to pull me in.

382
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,455
And... And I let go.

383
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,764
And I let go!

384
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:06,065
And he was... he was shouting,
saying he...

385
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,369
He couldn't swim!

386
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,706
Could <i>you</i> swim, Walter?

387
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,472
No!

388
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,412
No!

389
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,416
There... There wasn't...
There wasn't...

390
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,851
There... There wasn't
a swimming baths near us.

391
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,320
Okay, Walter.

392
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,789
I want you to reach out,

393
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,692
and you'll feel Brian's
and Eric's hands.

394
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,059
Hold on to them.

395
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,997
- Yeah.
- They understand.

396
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,295
You were just a little boy,
Walter.

397
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,564
Yeah.

398
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,599
Walter, don't cry, mate.

399
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,269
I hate to see you crying.

400
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,946
Come here, mate.
You hold on to me tight.

401
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,014
- Come on.
- Yeah.

402
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,345
Come on, mate.

403
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,709
You're all right.

404
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,379
You're all right, mate.

405
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,862
I like your perfume.

406
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,159
I'm not wearing any.

407
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,235
If any man on release after
serving a sentence for a crime

408
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:21,246
returns immediately to a life
of crime, we have failed.

409
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,318
I've always been
against these sessions.

410
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,582
Maybe you're reading
more into it.

411
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,055
No, I'm not.

412
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,989
She's out of her depth.

413
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,253
If anything went out,

414
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,352
she wouldn't be able
to control them.

415
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,328
And I'll put you any money on it

416
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,958
she's never worked in a nick
as tough as this one.

417
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:50,468
You have run me down
for 18 months.

418
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,341
Well, for your information,

419
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,642
when we have the big walkabout
tomorrow afternoon,

420
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,807
I am not quitting
without a fight.

421
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,407
Hang on a second, Ms. Hewitt.

422
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,214
No.
I wasn't talking about you.

423
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,278
It's Ms. Collins
and the drama group.

424
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,289
H-Honestly.

425
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Oh.

426
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,303
The...

427
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,234
The lads seem to think
she's getting too friendly

428
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,299
with Norman Jones.

429
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,078
Ah.
Ms. Collins.

430
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,840
Have I interrupted something?

431
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,120
I wanted to see you.

432
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,315
I was just on my way
to the office.

433
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,696
More white slips still saying
there's alcohol coming in.

434
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,599
Yeah.

435
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,399
You want to do yourself
a favor, mate?

436
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,598
Take some time off.

437
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,436
No.

438
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,635
Oh, come on, Gary.

439
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,071
Listen, pal.
You may be think...

440
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,343
Oh, come on.

441
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,947
There, now.
Come on, pal.

442
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,454
There you go.

443
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,564
I don't think Norman Jones
works well in a group session.

444
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,659
So what do you suggest?

445
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,602
Intensive one-to-one therapy.

446
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,148
As his case interests me,
I'm prepared...

447
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,765
No.

448
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:29,900
- Mavis?
- I'm sorry.

449
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,375
Mavis?

450
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,283
All I was suggesting is that
I have closer access to him.

451
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,082
I think you're already
too close.

452
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,147
Has somebody said something?

453
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,554
I think you should tell me
if they have.

454
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,652
If anything's been inferred

455
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,649
regarding my interaction
with a prisoner, then...

456
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,189
Um, is Mr. Marshall still there?

457
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,466
Yep. I'll get him for you.

458
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,264
Fine.
I'll hold.

459
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:02,036
I don't know what your sexual
preferences are, Ms. Hewitt,

460
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,201
but mine are not men.

461
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,212
Perhaps I should've put that
on my CV.

462
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,680
I believe that somewhere
inside Norman Jones

463
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,444
is a decent human being.

464
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,551
You obviously don't.

465
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,587
Ms. Collins, you have
already complained to me

466
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,319
about being put at risk.

467
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,791
Your physical safety
is my main concern.

468
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,354
- Hello. Yes. It's Helen.
- Yes, Governor.

469
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,230
We've just had notification.

470
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,361
There's a place for prisoner
Norman Jones at Broadmoor.

471
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,372
We're to arrange transportation
at this end.

472
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,908
You pulled it off. Good move.

473
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,705
Was there anything else,
Ms. Collins?

474
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,376
Governor?

475
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,517
If you could just get
the necessary documents for me.

476
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,053
I'll get onto it right away.

477
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,315
Thank you.

478
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,586
âª By the hand of the Almighty âª

479
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,428
âª We forward

Oh. Sorry.

I see your mate Snoopy

493
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,547
Chocolate lover.

494
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,847
I don't think I like chocolate.

495
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,245
âª Don't worry âª

Everyone on the wing

515
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,983
I'm gonna give them
the homemade hooch.

516
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,956
I don't drink.

517
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,356
Come on.
I haven't got a flask.

518

Get my share and yours

519
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,387
Get back on the tea urn, then.
Go on.

520
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,761
They're still dishing it out.

521
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,993
What have you got there, Brian?

522
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,265
A pen, Mr. Malahide, sir.

523
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,667
He's lying.
He's gonna ink up.

524
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,006
Is that all right, boss,
sir, your majesty?

525
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,637
You're not gonna put us
on report for that, are you?

526
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,273
âª Melodies pure and true âª

527
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:34,787
âª Saying this is my message
to you... âª

00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,221
One by one.

Just be cool.

530
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,591
âª You âª

531
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,288
Let the stuff take hold.
Don't stress.

532
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,955
Are you sure this is gonna work?

533
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,795
Look at all those monitors
and stuff, you know?

534
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,232
Where you been, bro?

535
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,702
One black face look the same
as another.

536
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,171
Touch me.

537
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,441
Easy.

538
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,676
Ho! Jimmy!

539
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,050
I'm going off now.

540
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,956
These biscuits are amazing.

541
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,461
Oh, look what you made me do.
Dickhead.

542
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,793
âª Is gonna be all right âª

543
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,094
Oi!

544
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,605
Here we go.

545
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,004
- Yeah.
- Shut it!

546
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,812
Come on, Victor.
Shower time.

547
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,872
You two, move!

548
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,494
Come on, Victor.
We haven't got all day.

549
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,518
Chop-chop.

550
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,252
That dozy bastard
nicked the shampoo!

551
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,851
This isn't shampoo.
It's conditioner, right?

552
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,693
You.
I want you tonight.

553
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,240
Empty stall here, mate.

554
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,523
Man down!
We got a man down!

555
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,324
For Christ's sake!
Give me a hand!

556
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,887
It's not me.
It's not me.

557
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,306
Open the bloody gate,
you bastards!

558
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,605
Ready?

559
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,583
Oh, just what we bloody need.

560

Open up, son.

561
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,982
I'll tell you when.

562
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,882
Okay, boys. In we come.

00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,988
Oh, bloody marvelous.

565
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,129
Hey!

566
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,470
Is that tomato ketchup,
Mr. Jackson?

567
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,373
Or have you busted
someone's snozzer?

568
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,741
Morgan's the last one.

569
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,112
Don't touch, all right?

570
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,244
No!

571
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,618
- What the bloody hell is...
- Leave it.

572
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,785
Leave it!

573
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:55,764
âª Knock-knock-knocking
on heaven's door âª

574
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,538
âª Yeah, yeah, yeah âª

575
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,651
Officer Udding.

576
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,287
Governor.

577
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,982
Open up.
Officer Udding.

578
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,959
Gate 2 opening.

579
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,455
It's Officer Udding.

580
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,498
Leave the gate open!
Get back to the wing!

581
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,965
It's out of control down there!

582
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,063
Ma'am?

583
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,036
It's not Udding.
Just keep going.

584
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,766
He's wearing track shoes.

585
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,064
Get security down here now.

586
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,871
Do not unlock
the interlocking gates.

587
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,571
That is not Officer Udding.

588
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:34,669
Open the gates!

589
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,477
Officer Udding with escort!
Open the bloody gates!

590
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,450
Come on!

591
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,018
You had no need
to hit Norman Jones, my lad.

592
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,249
I feel terrible!

593
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,655
- But you did.
- We all friggin' did.

594
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,660
That's what lets you
off the hook.

595
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,252
I didn't.

596
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,728
And if this is going down
on report,

597
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,664
I'll bloody well say I didn't!

598
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,633
You should put on report
that he's a liability.

599
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,931
- Oh, yeah?
- You get on with maintenance.

600
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,972
And you get on
with your bloody job!

601
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,472
I want someone here
and on D Wing.

602
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,906
Yes, ma'am.

603
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,843
- Is that yours?
- Aw, shit.

604
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,645
Mr. Morgan, if I find out

605
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,413
that this key belongs
to any one of the officers...

606
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,485
Are there any injuries
other than Victor Braithwaite?

607
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,958
No.

608
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,663
Well, I don't know about you,
but I needed a little snifter.

609
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,698
Where's Gary Marshall?

610
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,896
It was his duty night.

611
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,832
He was here, Ms. Hewitt,
but, uh...

612
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,475
he went to sort something out.

613
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,976
Go on. Go home.
Go on.

614
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,245
It's all under control.
Go home.

615
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,014
Okay.

616
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,850
I'll just finish up.

617
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,456
Cleaning's on the way down.

618
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,558
Move it, gentlemen.

619
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,873
We have till tomorrow afternoon

620
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,996
to get this place
completely bloody pristine.

621
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,241
Nice try, Snoopy.

622
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,778
Now you know how Samson felt.

623
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:02,952
Any complaints, Norman?

624
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,097
Norman.

625
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,866
You don't want to make
a complaint, do you?

626
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,517
All right, big man.

627
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,648
I was in the pub, and then...

628
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,751
Worse than some we've had
on the wing.

629
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,090
Yeah.

630
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,688
All right, are you, pal?

631
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,893
No.
But it's almost over.

632
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,899
Hey.

633
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,802
- Hey!
- Sorry.

634
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,671
It's me that should be crying,
not you, you big soft bugger.

635
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,506
I'm sorry, mate.

636
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,172
Come here.

637
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,647
Wing's clean and back in order.

638
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,184
Both escapees are in the block,

639
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,845
and I've arranged transportation
for Norman Jones.

640
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,946
We've got hangovers
and bellyaches.

641
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,184
Stuff was mainly puerile.

642
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,192
It didn't come from here,
did it?

643
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,194
No, it did not.

644
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,924
I'm afraid Colly is in
a catatonic state.

645
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,709
And how in God's name
did it get on every wing?

646
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,998
You'd better sort this, Gary,
and before 3:00.

647
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,865
Yeah.

648
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,531
Have you Norman Jones'
medical records ready?

649
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,735
Oh, Gary, Mavis has a list
of all officers on duty today.

650
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,335
I want all staff
not on the wings

651
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,074
in the officers' section
by 10 to 3:00.

652
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,274
Right.

653
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,285
Has the ambulance come
for Victor Braithwaite yet?

654
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,354
Coming for him any minute.
Don't worry.

655
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,742
We'll be neat and tidy
for the visit.

656
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,735
Not a stiff in sight.

657
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,331
You do realize how badly beaten
he was... or is?

658
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,487
The entire wing was drunk
and disorderly, Dr. Thomas.

659
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,037
Would you like to see the
bruises on some of the officers?

660
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,691
We're ready
for prisoner Norman Jones.

661
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,995
The van's waiting outside,
ma'am.

662
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,108
Yep.

663
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:08,986
Thank you, ma'am.

664
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,714
Hello, Norman.

665
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,951
What's looking up, then, eh?

666
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,619
You've always talked about
Broadmoor, haven't you?

667
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,829
Wait a minute.

668
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,333
No.

669
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,533
Let him go.

670
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,803
Do you want to have a word
in private?

671
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,082
This will only take a minute.

672
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,883
What I have to say
may be unethical, but...

673
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,821
Look, I have the Home Office
and HQ coming.

674
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,916
Yes, I know.

675
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,895
But do you know Gary Marshall's
wife has terminal cancer?

676
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,258
She might even be dead.

677
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,866
Now, if he hasn't chosen to tell
you, that's his business.

678
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,938
But at the same time,

679
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,672
you should have been
the first person he told.

680
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,245
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

681
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,513
If your officers
can't talk to you,

682
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,520
then you're the wrong person
for this job.

683
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,698
- You are so obsessed with...
- Why didn't you tell me?

684
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,917
Just let me finish.

685
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,028
You may have a vocation,
but don't for one second think

686
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,930
that you're the only one here
that has.

687
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,661
You have officers that care,
Helen.

688
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,912
And you also have some
that get away with beating up

689
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,201
a mentally sick man
like Norman Jones.

690
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,283
As a doctor, I am responsible
for the inmates' well-being.

691
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,468
Excuse me.

692
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,534
- Helen, listen.
- No. You listen to me.

693
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,674
Don't you dare talk down to me.

694
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:50,351
For 18 months,
I have had no private life.

695
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,083
Just Barfield.

696
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,616
Suddenly you feel
more than medically responsible

697
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,490
for the inmates.

698
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,089
I was responsible for you,
for every prisoner...

699
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,894
and for every member of staff.

700
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,660
I needed you to confide in me.

701
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,464
And I apologize.

702
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,478
But... I doubt
if you would've listened.

703
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,382
You never even tried.

704
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,096
I'm sorry.

705
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,059
Thank you.

706
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,409
And having a schoolgirl crush
on you at times

707
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,172
wasn't a great help.

708
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,524
I can't eat a thing either.

709
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,968
I have got a stonking headache.

710
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,697
I know.

711
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,103
I did me tat last night.

712
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,869
- What?
- Me tat.

713
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,102
- I inked up.
- Oh.

714
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,542
Do you want to see?

715
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,444
Yeah.
I have it for this.

716
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,146
Nairb?

717
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,276
Well, what does Nairb mean?
Nerd?

718
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:31,050
No, you dickhead.
It says Brian.

719
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,249
Can't you read?

720
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,791
No, it doesn't.

721
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,391
Oh, you pillock.

722
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,930
You done it in the mirror,
didn't you?

723
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,489
Hey!
Hey, he done his own ink.

724
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,297
Got his name back to front...
Nairb.

725
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,552
I apologize for the way
that I spoke to you.

726
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,844
Could the governor
come over to the control room?

727
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,801
Thank you.

728
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,531
Yep. She's here.

729
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,969
I'll be there in a second.

730
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,542
I'll make sure
that you get this.

731
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,910
On the way, Mr. Marshall.

732
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:40,186
Officer Keith here.
Gate number 3 with a prisoner.

733
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,256
Gate 3 open.

734
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,589
Gary.

735
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,056
I'm very sorry about your wife.

736
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,903
If you need any time off
or anything at all,

737
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,837
please... just ask.

738
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,431
There's nothing.

739
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,238
Officers Frisk
and Aspen on Gate number 6.

740
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,972
You've make me feel
very inadequate.

741
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,946
Gate 6 open.

742
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,142
I should have got to know you
better.

743
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,445
I apologize.

744
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,612
Thanks.

745
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,679
Um, what's this?

746
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,556
Belonged to Norman Jones.
Look at the flyleaf.

747
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:20,955
"For Maureen Collins,
whose laugh was like music."

748
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,495
Norman wrote all those notes.

749
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,970
- It's the same handwriting.
- Mm-hmm.

750
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,405
He said it was coming in
from the outside.

751
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:36,440
He comes in on a regular basis
for the workshop.

752
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,915
You'd need more
than one of my hacksaws

753
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,576
to get through these bars, eh?

754
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,153
Body-search Mr. Walbrook,
please.

755
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,826
So, uh, this is, uh, this is all
part of the new security.

756
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:54,898
Is that it?

757
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,738
Oh. Listen.

758
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,035
Uh, we should...

759
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,340
Should be finishing that, uh,
dressing table today.

760
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,211
Norman was wrong.
They've not found anything.

761
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,151
Not so much as a condom.

762
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,495
Take his trousers down.

763
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:29,033
Oh, shit.
Like... Okay.

764
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,693
It's, um...

765
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,432
See, I...
I was just short of the cash.

766
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,030
Uh...

767
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,567
- Oh.
- What you got here?

768
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:39,770
My God.

769
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,039
Hm.

770
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,411
He's a walking
bloody distillery.

771
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,246
I didn't mean any harm.

772
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,252
No harm at all.
I was just broke, you know?

773
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,878
I feel stupid.

774
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:52,116
- I want him charged.
- They're here.

775
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm not ready.

776
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,732
Yes, you are.

777
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,267
- Gordon Keller.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

778
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,333
Is she not available?

779
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,902
Uh, yes.
Here she comes now, sir.

780
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:16,513
You all set?

781
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,879
- Everyone standing by?
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,989
I'll get them in the
lecture hall as quick as I can.

783
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,213
Uh, Mr. Keller, Ms. Hewitt.

784
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,618
Ah.
Helen, isn't it?

785
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,055
Yes.
Mr. Keller, nice to meet you.

786
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,088
I hear you've been recruiting
new officers.

787
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,893
What about the ones that have
been on detached duty?

788
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:37,094
Some will return, but a number
have decided against it.

789
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,261
If I am to remain here,

790
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,862
then I'll obviously have
a large ratio of locals...

791
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,305
Unless, of course,
you're taking over.

792
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,173
Not really made up my mind.

793
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:51,775
And if it's to be privatized,
then I wouldn't be interested.

794
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,049
Can't get the decent officers.

795
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,052
Big problems already
in Doncaster.

796
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,588
That's why I hand-picked
officers with experience

797
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,954
to back up the trainees.

798
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,050
Not to back you up?

799
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,191
I don't think
any young recruit's

800
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,561
been thrown into the lion's den
straightaway.

801
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,623
Not like in the old days.

802
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,678
You wouldn't even remember
those days, would you?

803
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:14,934
No. I'm not ready for my pension
yet, Mr. Keller.

804
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,599
Gentlemen, shall we go inside?

805
00:46:54,245 --> 00:47:00,674
Barfield Prison has cost the
British taxpayer Â£69 million.

806
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,445
It has facilities
that any school,

807
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,422
college, or university

808
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,857
would get down on their knees
and beg for.

809
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:20,204
She's going for a knockout
in the first round.

810
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:22,900
I'd say it was shit or bust.

811
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,011
I believed that the loss
of freedom...

812
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,742
was the ultimate punishment,

813
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:38,279
that it was every inmate's right
once inside prison

814
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,417
to be given the opportunities
we provided.

815
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,225
I now know
that is not his right.

816
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:50,291
He must be taught to earn
every single privilege

817
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,964
that in our modern prisons today
are taken for granted.

818
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,740
If any prisoner on release after
serving a custodial sentence

819
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,770
returns immediately to a life
of crime, we have failed.

820
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,176
If that man has gained
criminal experience

821
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:11,621
from inside the prison
that held him, we have failed.

822
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:15,719
If any man raping a woman
rapes again on his release,

823
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,318
we have failed.

824
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,856
If a man kills and murders again
on his release, we have failed.

825
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,925
If any man on home leave,
any man on parole

826
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,733
commits a crime or does not
return to his prison,

827
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:30,036
we have failed.

828
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:36,543
Yet at the same time, we must
never lose sight of the fact

829
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,210
that no matter how hard it is
to find,

830
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:46,224
there is inside every criminal
a decent,

831
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,285
sometimes helpless,
frightened human being.

832
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,958
We must not fail him either.

833
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,410
Just as we must not fail
his victim.

834
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,715
The punishment must fit
the crime.

835
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,185
Only by implementing a tougher,
harsher regime,

836
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,779
can we hope to decriminalize
the criminal.

837
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,422
Rehabilitation is still
our priority.

838
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,463
It must become our prisoners'.

839
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,093
Bring all your personal
belongings with you,

840
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,600
'cause you're not getting
back on the bus!

841
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,569
Come along!
Get in line and move along!

842
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,266
Two orderly lines! Come on!
Move it! Move it!

843
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,083
Will you get a bloody move on?!

844
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,244
Pick your feet up,
you disgusting little man!

845
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,117
When I say move, I mean move!

846
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,282
What do you think you are,
the bloody circus?!

847
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,923
Governor?

847
00:50:36,305 --> 00:51:36,744
