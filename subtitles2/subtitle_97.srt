2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,747
Still mad because Starling
kicked your butt?

3
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,328
She did not kick my butt.

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,921
I might've kinda sorta lost
to Starling

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,765
and now my fury over it
consumes my entire existence.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,624
What are you doing
with Starling's autograph?

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,018
And how does she know
who you are?

8
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,796
You're Chaos.

9
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,626
Promise you won't tell my family
about this, especially Amy.

10
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,914
Starling, look out.

11
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,569
You just saved her life.

12
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,054
Could I maybe get your number?

13
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:25,805
I should probably take
yours too, you know,

14
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,179
just to make sure you're
staying on the right path.

15
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:37,992
That is a good one.

16
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,804
Okay. Sounds good.

17
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,326
Yeah, talk soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

18
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:44,965
Hey, Jake.

19
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,717
Were you just talking to
who I think you were talking to?

20
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,287
Yup. Starling.

21
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,142
Starling?

22
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,013
Oh. Well, I thought it was
the middle aged guy

23
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,234
from tech support who you
oddly became friends with.

24
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,018
Dennis?
No, I talked to him earlier.

25
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,499
Good news, I convinced him
to ditch the hairpiece

26
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,885
and embrace the bald.

27
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,238
Well, did Starling ask about me?

28
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,624
Not by name but she did tell me
to say hi to my weird friend.

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,706
That means she remembered me.

30
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,731
We've been talking every day

31
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,211
since we went
to our commercial shoot.

32
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,996
And tonight, she wants
to meet up in person.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,172
Oh my gosh, tonight?
Really?

34
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,522
Oh, that's amazing.
What am I gonna wear?

35
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,966
Well, how about pajamas?
Because you're staying home.

36
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,396
This is the first chance
Starling and I

37
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,398
have had to hang out alone
and I wanna make it special.

38
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,922
So we're going to a junkyard.

39
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,446
Sounds romantic.

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,529
Was the sewage plant
all booked up?

41
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,438
It's special because that's
where we had our first battle.

42
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,889
I threw a rusted out engine
block at her

43
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:46,726
and she stopped it midair
and threw it right back at me.

44
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,975
It was magical.

45
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,632
But anyway, I need you
to cover for me with my parents,

46
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:54,429
and more importantly Amy.

47
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,898
Oh, no.

48
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,510
I already feel guilty
about keeping a secret from her.

49
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,429
She's my best friend and she
wouldn't keep secrets from me.

50
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,921
- Yeah, she would.
- Yeah. You're probably right.

51
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,651
But I don't like
doing it to her.

52
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,044
Neither do I.

53
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,133
I'm not gonna keep
this from her forever,

54
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,093
just until I can find a way

55
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,096
to make her see
the Starling that I see.

56
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:15,976
You know, the one she won't
wanna toss off a tall building.

57
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,953
Fine.

58
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,578
But the stress of keeping
this secret is getting to me.

59
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:22,164
I'm starting to lose my hair.

60
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:24,580
I mean, the shower drain
looks like it's wearing a wig.

61
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,423
Come on,
you can stay for dinner.

62
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,583
And do you mind
wearing a hairnet?

63
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,857
I don't know what's going on.

64
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:41,200
But I'm gonna find out.

68

Does your family always have
pancakes for dinner?

69
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,229
Well, we can't break
the law anymore.

70
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,268
At least let us break
the rules of breakfast.

71
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:08,966
Hey, where's Colby?

72
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:11,279
I don't know.

73
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:12,890
Ever since he shape shifted
into a fly,

74
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:15,196
I've had the toughest time
keeping tabs on him.

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,764
I'm down here
avoiding your fork.

76
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,767
What are you doing
in my pancakes?

77
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,022
Get your own.

78
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,163
I wish I could,
but I'm stuck in the syrup.

79
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,073
Fine. I'll just eat around you.

80
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,773
- Hey, Amy.
- Hey.

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,042
Everything okay?

82
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:37,088
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

83
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,698
Do you know something
I don't know?

84
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,656
Because if you did,
you could tell me.

85
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,093
Doesn't matter what it is.

86
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:43,485
I mean,
we're best friends, right?

87
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,090
Of course.

88
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:47,918
Good.

89
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,666
Well, careful.

90
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,681
Your hair is shedding
all over your pancakes.

91
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,672
So what's everyone
doing tonight?

92
00:03:56,756 --> 00:04:00,328
Well, I'm off to the mall
to hang out at the food court

93
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:01,852
and check out
the surfboard store.

94
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,244
Yup, taking up surfing,

95
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,942
totally normal teenage boy
in Texas stuff.

96
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,198
Bye.

97
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:09,636
What about you, Hartley?

98
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:16,077
These pancakes are so good,
I might just eat them all night.

99
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:20,435
Well, I'm gonna go get a burger.

100
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,041
This whole breakfast for dinner
thing is, uh, it's really weird.

101
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,307
I did it.

102
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,577
I've been up
for three days straight

103
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,753
but I finally found a way
to stop Colby from being trapped

104
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,624
in a random shape shifting cycle.

105
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,975
We're gonna get our son back.

106
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,145
Ooh, pancakes.

107
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,284
Dad, stop. It's me.

108
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,938
Oh.

109
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:46,505
Well, hurry up
and swim out of that syrup.

110
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,804
Daddy's hungry.

111
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:54,730
All right, ladies.

112
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,645
Say hello
to my amazing invention

113
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,561
that's gonna turn Colby
fly here back to normal.

114
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:02,993
The first ever
Molecular Re-Atomizer.

115
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:07,221
I haven't slept since Wednesday,
clap for me.

116
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,617
You know what I need
to clap? Human hands.

117
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,271
Get on with it.

118
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,663
Okay.

119
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,578
Here we go.

120
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:18,189
Wait.

121
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,842
Are you sure it's safe
for us to stand this close?

122
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,366
Sure. Just cover your face

123
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,629
so your eyeballs
don't melt out of your skull.

124
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,674
- Seriously?
- No, I'm joking.

125
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,937
Or am I?

126
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,460
I am.

127
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,064
- Are you?
- I am not.

128
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,421
Okay.

129
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,895
Here we go.

130
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:40,901
What the... it tingles.

131
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,643
Okay. Now it burns.

132
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,212
Huh. The tingle is back.

133
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:51,128
It worked.

134
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,174
I mean, why wouldn't it?

135
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:57,750
My baby is back.

136
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,492
Oh.

137
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:01,972
Better hold up on the hugs.

138
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:04,011
You haven't showered
for a month.

139
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,368
Good to have you back, bud.

140
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,196
It's good to have a back, dad.

141
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,938
And man, I cannot wait
to stretch it out.

142
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:16,464
Sorry, son.

143
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:18,771
The machine is still
restructuring your DNA,

144
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,686
so you're gonna have to stay
in there a little longer.

145
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,124
Which will give us time to go
pick you up a cake to celebrate.

146
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,648
We couldn't decide between
welcome back to your body

147
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,215
or congrats
on being normal again,

148
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:29,825
so we're just gonna swipe one

149
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,611
from the neighbor's
retirement party.

150
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,743
You can't do that.

151
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,136
He's old.

152
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,219
Probably wouldn't
even know it's gone.

153
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,535
I'll wait with you, Colby.

154
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,840
Do you want anything?

155
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,929
Yeah. Actually,
I'm kind of thirsty.

156
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,751
Could you grab me that water?

157
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,408
Oh. No, no, no, no.

158
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,892
What kind of evil lair
doesn't have paper towels?

159
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,072
Oh, no.

160
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,646
What's wrong?

161
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,076
Why do I sound like this?

162
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,521
And why do I feel
taller and thicker?

163
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,692
I've got bigger everything.

164
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,832
I think the water
shorted out the console

165
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,052
and it made you older.

166
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,792
Look.

167
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,620
That's me?

168
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:28,182
Whoa. I'm a major hottie.

169
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,235
Yeah. I mean, no.

170
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,627
I mean, ew.

171
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,841
I mean, I gotta fix this.

172
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:42,724
Come on, dumb machine,
turn it back.

173
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,379
Good idea, Hartley.
If things take a bad turn,

174
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:47,164
just start hitting
random buttons.

175
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,033
Is it working?

176
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,262
Why do I feel the sudden urge
to second guess my life choices

177
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,997
and spend all my savings
on a sports car?

178
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,532
Probably because of this?

179
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,751
Now I'm old.

180
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,927
What happened to the hottie?

181
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,407
I know.

182
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,148
His eyes were so dark
and soulful,

183
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,970
I could just get lost in them.

184
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,365
I'm just gonna keep
pressing buttons.

185
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,120
Sorry, I'm late.

186
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,991
Probably should've chosen
a junkyard

187
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,993
with less angry guard dogs.

188
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,343
I thought they were
kind of sweet.

189
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,128
But then again,
everyone's sweet to me

190
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,907
because, you know, superhero.

191
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,389
- It's good to see you again.
- You too.

192
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:50,096
So, now what do we do?

193
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,398
I thought we were gonna go get
ice cream but this is a choice.

194
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,711
Come on, we had our first
battle in the junkyard.

195
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:57,973
I was being sentimental.

196
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,758
We also fought
on a tropical island.

197
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,493
We could've met there.

198
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:05,764
What was that?

199
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,418
The dogs are back

200
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,109
and they can smell my fear.

201
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,210
Amy.

202
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,598
Guess I didn't get the invite.

203
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:30,919
Jake, get away from her.

204
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,617
How'd you know I was here?

205
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,966
I overheard your conversation
with Hartley.

206
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,750
You're lucky I got here
just in time.

207
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,969
In time for what?

208
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,362
To save you.

209
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,841
I'm sorry, who are you?

210
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,756
- His sister.
- Wait.

211
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,194
You're Havoc?

212
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,320
Girl, you had me fooled.

213
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,677
- Amy, I can explain.
- No need.

214
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,766
At first, I was upset
but then I thought

215
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,594
of course I can
trust my brother.

216
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,641
He'd never meet with my nemesis
behind my back on purpose.

217
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:59,426
I mean, supervillains
don't hang out with superheroes.

218
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,038
She's clearly taking advantage
of nice guy Jake for one reason,

219
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:04,779
to lure you into a trap.

220
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,433
It's not a trap.

221
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,696
And you know who'd say that?
A person setting a trap.

222
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,353
Well, if you're gonna
start something,

223
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,833
I'm gonna end it.

224
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,965
- Not this time.
- Stop fighting.

225
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,266
You're gonna attract the dogs.

226
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,932
There's one advantage
I've always had over you, Havoc.

227
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,717
I can fly and you're stuck
on the ground.

228
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,060
That's where you're wrong.

229
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,282
Whoa.

230
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,160
When did you learn
how to do that?

231
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,330
Just now.
Lucky for me it worked.

232
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:50,906
Starling.

233
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,998
Yup.
Still working on the landing.

234
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,703
Jake, get out of the way.

235
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,835
No, Amy.
This has gone way too far.

236
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,098
I mean it, Jake.
Get out of the way.

237
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,840
It's time for me to finish this.

238
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,013
Amy!

239
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:19,201
Aging 30 years in a day
has me so confused.

240
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:22,764
I don't know whether to play
Little League or coach it.

241
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,774
There you are.
Where have you been?

242
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,037
Well, Gara's retirement
bash got canceled,

243
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,865
so we had to improvise

244
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,780
and steal a cake from some
kid's birthday party.

245
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,734
Won't be a happy birthday
for you, Johnny.

246
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,829
Who's this?

247
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,912
It's me, Colby.

248
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,661
- What?
- Oh, no.

249
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,880
I kind of spilled
on your console

250
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,839
and then everything sparked

251
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,710
and then he turned 20 and then
I started pressing more buttons

252
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,011
and then he turned into that.

253
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,934
Mom, can you please
make me a sandwich?

254
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,408
And don't forget
to cut off the crust.

255
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,374
It is Colby.

256
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,897
My son is older than me.

257
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,551
Fix this.

258
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:06,031
I'm on it.

259
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:07,592
I'll be in the lair.

260
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,246
Hello, Celia.

261
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,474
Robert, you really
don't have a problem

262
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,346
with your lady just waltzing
into tenant's homes?

263
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,434
Hey.

264
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:18,870
I may be the chief of police

265
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,960
but she's the chief
of everything else.

266
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:24,434
Taught him that
on our first date.

267
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,879
What are you doing here,
grandma?

268
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,709
I came to tell you that Robert
and I are going dancing.

269
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,798
Salsa dancing.

270
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,277
Things are gonna get
hot tonight.

271
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:36,757
Okay.

272
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,760
Now you two have fun,
and then bye.

273
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,016
Who's this?

274
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:44,156
You don't have someone else
living here, do you?

275
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,810
- No, he's actually...
- The plumber.

276
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,551
He's a plumber.

277
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:48,813
That's his job.

278
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,423
That's what he does
for a living.

279
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,985
Yup. He plumbs.

280
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,776
I know you're new at lying

281
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,033
but that was more lie
than we needed.

282
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,825
I didn't call a plumber.

283
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,479
It was an emergency.

284
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,568
A leaky faucet emergency.

285
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,215
Why didn't you call me?

286
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:10,182
Because I knew you were getting
ready for your date with Robert.

287
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,227
Oh, okay.

288
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,707
Did I mention
we're going salsa dancing?

289
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,709
- Yes.
- Yes.

290
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,755
Hold on a minute.

291
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,839
If you're a plumber, let me see
your plumber's license.

292
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,717
- You can't.
- Why not?

293
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,938
Because I left it
back at the shop.

294
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,809
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,057
There's a ring of scam artists
around town

296
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,466
pretending to be plumbers
to swindle money out of people

297
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,859
and he could be one of them.

298
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:38,558
No one scams me
or my granddaughter.

299
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:41,126
No, I swear I'm legit.

300
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,302
I think we should stick around
to make sure.

301
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,565
We might have to delay
salsa dancing.

302
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,088
That's okay.

303
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,264
The only thing more romantic
than salsa dancing

304
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:52,087
is shaking down scammers.

305
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:58,050
Can I interest anyone in
a young child's birthday cake?

306
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:07,146
Did you seriously just
protect Starling over me?

307
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,330
What is going on, Jake?

308
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:14,631
A few months ago back
in Sintropolis when I was Chaos,

309
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,808
she saved my life.

310
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:20,461
If it wasn't for her, I might
not even be here right now.

311
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:23,976
He was dangling off the side of
a building and I pulled him up.

312
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,664
Girl power.

313
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:28,341
Sorry, continue.

314
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:32,003
All those times you asked me why
I was becoming a better person,

315
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,483
that's why.

316
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,223
Starling gave me a reason to.

317
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,703
So this whole time you acted

318
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,140
like you were trying to become
a better person

319
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,839
but it was also you could get
cozy with my nemesis?

320
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,668
No, it didn't start out
that way.

321
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,583
I went to ColossaCon
to thank her

322
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,340
and we've kind of been
talking ever since.

323
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,083
You told me not to go

324
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:52,980
because I would be putting
our family in danger

325
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:55,113
but you're the one who's been
putting us in danger

326
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,593
and for some superhero?

327
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,159
But she's not
just some superhero.

328
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:00,161
She's so much more than that.

329
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,598
I've been talking to her and if
you just got to know her and...

330
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,376
I do know her.

331
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,205
And I thought I knew you.

332
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:10,992
We never used to keep secrets
from each other but...

333
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,996
I don't think
I can trust you ever again.

334
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:21,263
We may share the same
villain blood but...

335
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,005
you're not my brother anymore.

336
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,184
Amy, wait.

337
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,586
Amy won't even talk to me.

338
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,682
I should've just told her
about us from the start.

339
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,684
We all make mistakes.

340
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:49,161
I mean, I don't because,
again, superhero.

341
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,214
I knew Amy would be upset

342
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:55,565
but I never expected
it would hurt her this bad.

343
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,131
Don't you have some kind of
time travel power

344
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,785
you can use to undo this?

345
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:01,440
If I did, I'd go back
and get even

346
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,355
for that last sonic
blast to the ribs.

347
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,829
It really hurt.

348
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:08,882
Well, I'm sure my whole family
knows by now,

349
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,711
so looks like I'll be
crashing here for a while.

350
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:13,365
No.

351
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,180
You need to go home
and make this right.

352
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:18,675
How?

353
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,806
Now that Amy knows
that we're seeing each other,

354
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,803
- I...
- We were seeing each other.

355
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:26,857
What?

356
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,381
Look, Jake.

357
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:32,073
I like you a lot.

358
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,256
But I'm not in the business
of breaking up families,

359
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,476
even if you are villains.

360
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,043
No. I'll find a way.

361
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:40,827
We can work it out.

362
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,041
It won't be that easy
and we both know it.

363
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,006
We're from two completely
different places.

364
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,878
Places that don't understand
each other

365
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,793
and aren't willing
to work together.

366
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:51,577
And because of that,

367
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,320
it's too risky for both of us.

368
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:56,930
Please.

369
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:59,716
I've already lost my sister.
I can't lose you too.

370
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,233
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,020
But in time, you'll see this is
the best thing for both of us.

372
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,851
Goodbye, Jake.

373
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,734
At least it couldn't get
much worse.

374
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,043
Okay. You know what,
bring it on, dogs.

375
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,561
Just kidding,
just kidding, just kidding.

376
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,047
Okay.

377
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,616
Okay.

378
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,141
Okay.

379
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:43,150
Okay what?

380
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:46,153
Grandma, why don't you and
Robert give our plumber friend

381
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,019
a little breathing room?

382
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,505
There.

383
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,936
Now you can breathe.

384
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,640
Come on, Celia.

385
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,859
He's a stand-up guy.

386
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,512
I think you can trust him.

387
00:17:57,596 --> 00:18:00,341
Why would I trust him?
I don't trust you.

388
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:02,474
You trust me, don't you, Cels?

389
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,774
I trust you to stay out
of my business.

390
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,308
I'm seeing too much
looking and not enough fixing.

391
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,363
Why don't you
just start plumbing?

392
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,662
Hurry up down there.

393
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,664
This salsa queen wants to dance.

394
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:22,886
You know, some people say
I'm the Shakira of Valley View,

395
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,802
because these hips don't lie.

396
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,973
- Lovely.
- Please hurry up down there.

397
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:31,808
Hey, I think I did it.

398
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,637
Aha! I knew it.

399
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,378
He's no plumber, he's a fraud.

400
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,728
Come out from under there
so I can book you

401
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:41,246
for swindling these nice people.

402
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,544
Who's that?

403
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,504
It's me, the plumber.

404
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,858
Well, how long
were you down there for?

405
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:59,086
You know the plumber
we met earlier?

406
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,707
Well, this is his father.

407
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,839
Father?

408
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:03,796
Oh.

409
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,190
Yup. I'm his father.

410
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:07,713
That can't be.

411
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,846
I know I saw the other plumber
go under there

412
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,499
and he never came back out.

413
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,460
Well, to be fair, you have
had a lovely distraction

414
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,244
around you for the whole time.

415
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:18,506
What distraction?

416
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,813
This distraction.

417
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:22,380
Oh, right.

418
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:24,599
Yes, I did.

419
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,298
I guess that's why
I didn't see them switch.

420
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,691
You know, I'm sure
the plumber's father does not

421
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,303
take kindly to people
calling his son a scammer,

422
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,950
isn't that right, sir?

423
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,223
Start talking like an old man.

424
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,088
You bet your fanny that's right.

425
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:44,706
I built my plumbing business
with my bare hands

426
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,882
back in the 1800s.

427
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,885
- 1900s.
- 1900s.

428
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:50,277
I will not stand for anyone

429
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,889
calling my son
or my business a sham.

430
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,501
All due respect, sir, we was
just trying to make sure...

431
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:58,503
Gobbledygook.

432
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:01,680
The only crime my son ever
committed was working too hard.

433
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:03,769
I'm hungry.

434
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,112
When do I get pudding?

435
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,947
My apologies, sir.

436
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,298
I certainly do respect my elders
and I appreciate the history

437
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:12,778
you built here in Valley View.

438
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,562
Well, good.

439
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,521
- And you.
- Slow your roll, pops.

440
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,056
You don't wanna try
that with me.

441
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,310
Finally.

442
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:24,790
Now I can get down to the lair

443
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:26,748
and work on getting
our son back.

444
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:28,838
And it looks like I'm off
to buy some pudding.

445
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:30,448
The smooth stuff.

446
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:33,097
Anything crunchy
sits in me like a rock.

447
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:35,925
Oh, hello?

448
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,717
Are you forgetting something?

449
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,973
Oh, right.

450
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,137
Well, if I got to fix
the old man, you gotta fix that.

451
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,691
Hey, Amy.

452
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,948
Where were you?
I've been texting you for hours.

453
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,827
Don't.

454
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,082
I know everything.

455
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,051
Oh, I've been at the junkyard
with Jake and Starling.

456
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,879
Oh, boy.

457
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,881
How could you keep this
all a secret from me?

458
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,361
Look, I'm sorry.

459
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,189
I was just trying
to protect everyone.

460
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:17,887
Jake is my friend too.

461
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:21,542
And when a friend asks
to keep a secret, I do it.

462
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,762
You know,

463
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:25,807
for the first time
in my life, I thought

464
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,375
I actually made a real friend.

465
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:31,197
Someone who'd be there
for me, have my back.

466
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:35,332
But you're just as bad as Jake.

467
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,291
Amy, please.

468
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,207
I didn't even wanna keep
this secret at all.

469
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,593
But you did.

470
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,559
You know, I never wanted
a best friend in the first place

471
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,337
and...

472
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,861
now I know why.

473
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,566
She knows.

474
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,531
Yeah.

475
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:03,920
Well, how do we fix this?

476
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,140
Honestly, Hartley...

477
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:09,969
I don't know if we can.

478
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,900
Well, Colby,
the good news is I am a genius

479
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:23,728
and I'll find a way
to get you back.

480
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,556
The bad news is you'll have
to wait until Friday

481
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,079
so you can buy us movie tickets

482
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,162
with your
senior citizen discount.

483
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,911
We'll need you
to buy us popcorn.

484
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,870
We'd share it with you

485
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,953
but it might get stuck
in your dentures.

486
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:39,440
Hey.

487
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,311
At least now
I'm old enough to drive.

488
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,395
Oh, now you're too old to drive.

489
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,491
That's a bummer.

490
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,923
Well, at least
I'm old enough to drive.

491
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,361
Oh, sweetie.

492
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,277
Why don't you take a nap?

493
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,069
Come on.

494
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:02,035
Don't forget
to take his teeth out.

495
00:23:03,305 --> 00:24:03,241
