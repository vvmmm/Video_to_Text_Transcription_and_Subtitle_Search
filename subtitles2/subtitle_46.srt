No. It's Tarzan.
Can you see him?

311
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,763
He's coming on the line.
Can you see him?

312
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,931
I don't want to see him.
I owe him favors from the block.

Oh, you're dead.

314

- Hey, Tarzan. Welcome to C Wing.
- Will you shut up?

315
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,890
Morning.

Tarzan.

Oi!

318
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,402
I don't approve of drugs,

319
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,907
so there'll be no drugs
on this wing, okay?

320
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,675
I'm Eric.

321
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,146
Hello, Eric.
Now get out of my face.

322
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,780
S-Sorry, Tarzan.

What are you doing
with potatoes and pudding?

324
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Put it back.

325

The state of you.

You're overweight and unfit.

You want protein, no carbs.

Sorry, Tarzan.

00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,268
Yeah. Great, Tarzan.
Yeah.

333
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,638
I'll go to the gym with you.

I've never seen him
so well behaved.

Everything all right, Tarzan?

337
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,340
So far so good, Mr. Jackson.

338
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,283
I want to be in this musical,
you know.

339
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,650
I'm afraid it's fully cast,

to the show.

Want to be involved
in everything.

When can I see the show?

345
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,088
Not just yet
because we're still rehearsing.

346
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,996
How many performances are there?

347
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,500
Just the one.

and S.O. Russell Morgan.

Sorry.
Have I kept everyone waiting?

Thanks.

Just a reminder...
Will you call Mr. Andrews at HQ,

perhaps after the meeting's
adjourned?

- Okay.
- Ah! We're all gathered. Good.

Right.
Where shall I park myself?

362
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,094
There's a chair for Mr. Falla
when he is called.

363
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,037
I would like him present
throughout.

364
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,939
I do not think Mr. Morgan
should be subjected

to facing him across a table.

I'll kick off
the preliminary discussions,

371
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,281
which deal with
Barfield's security

372
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,792
and transfer arrangements
on the day in question...

373
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,091
- Is it gone?
- November the 22nd,

374
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,256
which in case anyone here
is not aware,

375
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,631
that was the date that
my client, Mr. George Falla,

376
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,162
was accused of taking Senior
Officer Russell Morgan hostage.

377
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,069
Perhaps you could outline
for me, Ms. Hewitt.

378
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,908
Or, as you were not actually in
charge of Barfield at the time,

379
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,040
perhaps you'd care to delegate
to someone who was?

380
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,276
I was the HOC

381
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,718
and... and acting governor
on the 22nd of November.

382
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,312
Would that be because the...

383
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,256
The then-governor of Barfield
was unavailable

384
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,317
because he was playing
a round of golf?

385
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,885
Mr. Turnbull,
Governor Keller is no longer

386

with the prison services.

387
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,798
Well, now he's retired, he'll
have plenty of time for golf.

388
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,099
Could you now take me through
the transfer of prisoners

389
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,402
from their release,
in the case of Mr. Falla,

390
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,001
from Parkhurst Prison to
their arrival here at Barfield?

391
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,739
HQ issued a movement order,

392
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,714
which was then faxed here
to Governor Keller.

393
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,478
The officers accompany
the transportee.

394
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,545
The times for the relocation are
decided between the two prisons.

395
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,614
In this case,
the prisoner, George Falla,

396
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,885
was in a wheelchair,

397
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,894
but traveled in a CAT-A
reinforced van.

398
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,556
But the hospital wing did not
have the relevant information

399
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,260
regarding my client's
previous prison records

400
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,460
and security records.

401
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,594
No, they did not, but...

402
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,662
They remained at reception and
were then sent to the governor,

403
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,231
who was, as we know, absent.

404
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,005
So the officers
in the hospital wing

405
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,377
were not aware of my client's
previous prison records.

Mr. Morgan, I am in no way
making light of your injuries

466
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,200
or of the terror
that you must have felt.

467
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,901
You would also have been on duty
for 18 hours.

468
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,904
That is true.

469
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,450
Mr. Morgan, would you like
to take a break?

470
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,670
No.
Why?

471
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,542
They're about to take a break.

472
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,728
Mr. Morgan should have had
more than just a break

473
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,880
on the afternoon
of November the 22nd last.

474
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,549
Senior Officer Morgan
is not on trial here.

475
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,422
His work has been exemplary
for more than 10 years!

476
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,429
And a fat lot of good
it's gonna stand for.

477
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,295
You bastards can bring me here
for this so-called Inquiry,

478
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,890
but it's not for my benefit,
is it?

479
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,163
It's for the prisoner
who did this to me.

480
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,704
- Come on.
- I can't sleep.

481
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,967
I can't work.
I can't eat.

482
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,100
All I can think about
is what happened in that cell.

483
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,940
Hey, you gonna tell me
who is taking care of me?

484
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,912
- Who is looking after my wife?
- Come on.

485
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,346
I am sick of the lot of you.

486
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,526
You think I don't know you're
gonna let that evil bastard

487
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,590
get away with what he did?

488
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,143
- Well, screw you all.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

Stay with him.

490

You seen Russell Morgan?

491
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,089
He's in the yard, Gov.

492
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,790
It's lockup. Come on.
Back to your cells.

493
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,475
Come on, you lads!
Let's be having you now.

494

We ain't got all day.

Don't you hang around
when I talk to you,

499
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,133
you ugly little man.

Come on. Let's be having you.

00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:25,648
Hey.

504
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,710
I've had Williams
take Russell Morgan home.

505
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,915
Good.
I'm gonna go over to see him.

506
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:33,926
Ms. Hewitt, Mr. Marshall,
could we continue?

507
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,497
Now, would you tell
everyone here, Mr. Falla,

508
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,837
a little
of your medical history?

509
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:57,316
When I was 12 years old,
my father became very ill.

510
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,651
He was diagnosed as having
cancer of the bowels.

511
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:09,353
It took nearly two years
for him... to pass on.

512
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,265
And I saw him become a skeleton,

513
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,133
unable to feed himself, dress...

514
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,071
or do anything for himself.

515
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,140
It left me with a deep emotional
scar and a terror of illness.

516
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,473
Especially anything
to do with the bowels.

517
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,482
Look, I don't know
about balaclavas.

518
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,043
I mean, I'm not sure about this.

519
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,918
- Maybe you wait a few days.
- No.

520
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,652
You said you wanted us to knock
Keith Smith about for you.

521
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,970
We're prepared to do it, but
you've got to play your part.

522
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,326
- Come on.
- I know. I know.

523
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,454
I just don't know when.

524
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,431
You leave the cell door open
for us, then.

525
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,558
If you do, we'll go down there
and do him in.

00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,567
You made the deal.

527
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,866
Okay.
I'll get the masks.

528
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,771
But don't do anything
till I tell you, all right?

529
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,571
I've got to go now.
Look.

Thank you.

Thing is, Eugene,
when they know we've got this,

537
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,462
they're gonna do a strip search.

538

No.

We're gonna give it to Tarzan

Oh, that's brilliant.
Nice one.

I've always maintained
my innocence.

- Y-Yes, I think at this stage

564
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,946
we should give Mr. Falla
the opportunity,

565

before being questioned
by D.C.I. Tully and D.S. Marsh,

00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,271
And also... settle down... take
one of these leaflets, okay?

619
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,814
What's a fax machine?

620
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,474
Well, it's about that big, like.

621
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,389
But that's a printer.
That's not a fax machine.

622
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,013
If it were a fax machine,
you put the paper in there,

623
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,749
and then you dial the number,
right?

624
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,087
So the paper goes in this end
and out there,

625
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,702
and at the other end,
they get the message.

626
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,388
Stop talking, please.

627
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,589
- As we have more students...
- Which other end?

628
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,741
- Well, you've sent it now.
- Than we have machines,

629
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,963
two people will have to work
the same word processor, okay?

630
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,435
How does it do that?

631
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,666
Well, they've got a fax machine
at their end.

632
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,968
It's all done with codes.

633
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,973
What codes?

634
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,236
Phone numbers.

635
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,073
- I'm not talking to you.
- Settle down.

636
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,289
MAN: Do you think we can bring
up porno from the Internet?

637
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,043
- How does it work?
- I don't know.

638
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,812
If it was a fax machine,
you'd put the paper here,

639
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,912
it comes out there,
and then they get it.

640
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,718
What, the same piece of paper?

641
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,418
No. They've got their paper
at the other end.

642
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,690
The keyboard now here,
on the word processor,

643
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,664
is structured like
an ordinary typewriter, okay?

644
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,825
But your commands...

645
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
SAMORA:
It rolls out from their end.

646
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,963
- The light comes on and...
- Please sit down.

647
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,569
- Can you type?
- No.

648
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,543
I can.
I can type.

649
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,545
Can you take care of this?
I'll explain later.

650
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:06,279
Brian, all of you, please,
do not talk amongst yourselves.

651
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,481
Mr. Tarzan, isn't it?

652
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,614
Yes.

653
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,055
Glad you could join us.

654
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,751
Thank you.

655
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,659
Well, how much typing
have you done before?

656
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,821
Uh...

657
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,455
Do you have a speed?

658
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,863
What?

659
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,663
You want to show me?

660
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,633
Yeah.

661
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,568
Do you touch-type
or need to look?

662
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,230
I wouldn't mind touching her up,
eh?

663
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:28,239
[Grunts]

664
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,436
[Laughter]

665
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,709
You behave yourself, son, or
I'll put you through that wall.

666
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,478
- Sit down!
- What the fuck?

667
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,848
- Sit!
- [Laughter continues]

668
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,918
Shut up!

669
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,247
The next one of you
starts talking,

670
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,054
I'll give you a thrashing.

671
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,472
I could do it a lot faster,
you know, if it was a real one.

672
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,439
Good.

673
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,237
Now pass the card to Brian.

674
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,620
You'll be able to start
straightaway

675
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,010
on the word processor.

676
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,446
This isn't in alphabetical
order, you know, miss.

677
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,574
That is the point, Brian.

678
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,987
The keyboard is structured to
assist fast movement, all right?

679
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,490
The letters are arranged
QWERTYUIOP.

680
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:25,429
Q-W-E-R-T-Y-U-I-O-P.

681
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,658
Okay.

682
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,227
Does anyone have any idea
why they are arranged

683
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,068
in this particular order?

684
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,108
- Miss?
- Yes.

685
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,767
Because we use them the most.

686
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,069
Yes.
Good.

687
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,580
- Ooh! He got it right.
- Ooh!

688
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,413
MEN:
Ooh!

689
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,484
No comment.

690
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,896
During the continued assault
on Officer Morgan,

691
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,788
you placed a noose,
or a ligature, around his neck

692
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,984
and you tightened it.

693
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,583
Why was that?

694
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,722
No comment.

695
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,790
You continued to threaten
Officer Morgan

696
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,710
inasmuch as you were intending
to take his life.

697
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,100
Was that really your intention?

698
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,038
No comment.

699
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,472
This interview will terminate
here.

700
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,269
Due to police procedure,

701
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,454
you have the right to read
the record of this interview.

702
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,413
If you agree it to be a true
and accurate record,

703
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,278
you may initial
each of your answers

704
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,944
and sign at the foot
of each page.

705
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,578
Will you do that?

706
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,691
Yes.

707
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,760
Well, at least <i>that</i> got
a response.

708
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,833
Is it still all right to say no?

709
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,776
D.C.I. Tully, the governor
would like to see you

710
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,369
before you leave.

711
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,352
WATTS:
W-Why... Why am I in here?

712
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,829
I-I w-w-want to hold my baby.

713
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,731
CHISWICK: Sorry, Kevin.
Nothing to do with us.

714
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,326
Kev?

715
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,531
Kev, what's the matter with you?

716
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,471
- WATTS: W-W-W...
- What have they done to you?

717
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,873
N-Nothing.
H-Hold him.

718
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,038
- Kev, your voice is all slurred.
- L-Let me see him.

719
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,412
And your face.

720
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,049
- Who did this to you?
- S-Show me the baby.

721
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,580
Anna, s-show me my boy.

722
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,594
[Baby cooing]

723
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,828
The escaped prisoner,
Kevin Watts.

724
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,094
What about him?

725
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,328
When he was returned to us,

726
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,339
he had severe bruises
covering almost his entire body.

727
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,638
Did he need to be restrained
by any of your officers?

728
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,645
I don't know
what you're implying.

729
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,114
Did he require to be restrained
by your officers?

730
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,445
I have no knowledge
of any extra force being used

731
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,045
to restrain
the escaped prisoner.

732
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,050
Has he filed a complaint?

733
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,793
No.

734
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,058
Then there's, uh,
nothing more to be said.

735
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,130
Excuse me.

736
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,910
CHISWICK:
All right, Kevin. Time's up.

737
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,664
Visit's over.
Let's go.

738
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,705
- [Baby cooing]
- WATTS: Hey.

739
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,306
CHISWICK:
Let's go, Kevin.

740
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,105
Andy?

741
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,839
- [Grunts]
- Kevin!

742
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,405
Kevin, don't fight them!
Don't fight them! Please!

743
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,179
- [Sobbing]
- Let's go.

744
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,722
Could you, um, find me
that stuff for my upset stomach?

745
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,936
I don't know where I left it.

746
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,826
Shellfish.
I never touch it.

747
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,057
It wasn't shellfish.
It was chicken.

748
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,292
You might have salmonella.

749
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,960
Did you friend have it
as well... Mr. Lennox?

750
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,335
I believe you left this
in the boardroom.

751
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,861
Oh, thank you.

752
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,374
You mind if I say something?
Without prejudice.

753
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,552
You're going to try and prove

754
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,442
that George Falla
is mentally unstable.

755
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,613
Mr. Falla was obviously
greatly distressed and desperate

756
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,811
to get the correct medical
assessment of his illness.

757
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:07,885
Bullshit.

758
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:11,515
He's a nasty, vicious bastard
with a string of convictions

759
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,819
and a history of violence

760
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,019
towards officers
and inmates alike.

761
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,857
What are you trying to prove,
eh?

762
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,658
That everyone held
in Her Majesty's prisons

763
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,997
has the legal right
to proper medical treatment

764
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,971
and not to be forced into taking
drastic steps to ensure it.

765
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,666
Thank you for your cooperation,
Ms. Hewitt.

766
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,539
Mr. Marshall,
would you show Mr. Turnbull

767
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,340
to the gate, please?

768
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,649
Mavis, would you, uh, would you
call Mr. Lennox, please?

769
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,446
Ask if he's poorly too, shall I?

770
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,511
No, Mavis.
I need him to drive me home.

771
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,290
I don't know about you,
but I don't like it.

772
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,919
I mean, he may be the new boy
on the block,

773
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,691
but I hate it.

774
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,163
'Cause every time he comes up
to me,

775
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,632
I make some excuse to walk away.

776
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,758
Who are you on about?

777
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,996
Come on.
Officer Hully. Jason.

778
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,662
- Ah.
- That's nice. What is it?

779
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,764
I just stay well out of it,
mate.

780
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,570
- Is it expensive, this?
- Don't know.

781
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,110
Oh!
Bloody hell.

782
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,304
I'll stick to me Old Spice.

783
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:08,879
Which one?

784
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,917
Well, they're both all right.
Are they silk, are they?

785
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,679
Hey.

786
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,453
I mean, Ms. Hewitt, she said
not to mention it to him,

787
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,924
but I don't like it.

788
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,790
Neither does Len Syons.

789
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,885
And according to Buffy

790
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,932
and that other little Scouse git
Samora, he's bent.

791
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,091
I preferred the other one.

792
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,794
What, gay?
Are you kidding me?

793
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,733
No.

794
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,747
Bent, as in trying to get
those two little pillocks

795
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,296
to beat up Keith Smith.

796
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,739
Oh, well, I know he's been
having a go at him for weeks,

797
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,674
but Smith gives the aggro
to all of us.

798
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,972
Do you know what I mean?

799
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,512
This is serious.

800
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,483
They say he's bringing in
balaclavas.

801
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,452
Oh, yeah.
What, and a baseball bat?

802
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,715
They're just having a go.

803
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,313
She ain't taking it seriously,
is she?

804
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,324
She's taking it seriously.

805
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,292
They've got him repeating it
on tape.

806
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,726
Ooh.

807
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,654
Are we on for a game of darts
tonight?

808
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,359
Yeah, I'm on for that.

809
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,166
Oi.

810
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,232
Hey.
Do you want some advice?

811
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,709
Stay well out of it, mate.

812
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,011
Hey.
He's one of us.

813
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,916
Yeah.
Uh, maybe he is.

814
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,115
And maybe, just maybe, he isn't.

815
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,681
Oh.
Got a date, have you?

816
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,023
I sincerely hope so.

817
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,153
Good night.

818
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,853
Good night.

819
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,259
Going down the pub?

820
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,767
Not tonight.

821
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,337
Got a date as well, have you?

822
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,503
Nope.

823
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,206
But I deserve one.

824
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:54,818
Good night.

825
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,548
Yeah.

826
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,349
Anyone coming down the pub?

827
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,660
I can't have you persuade
or cajole me into something

828
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,894
that I don't feel
fully confident about taking on.

829
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,460
Now, what exactly have you told
everyone?

830
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,369
Nothing.

831
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,237
But you <i>are</i> a lawyer,
aren't you?

832
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,832
I mean,
are you so inundated with work

833
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,344
that you can't even consider it?

834
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,875
No comment.

835
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:26,813
Simon.

836
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,252
I've only just been made a
junior partner, for God's sake.

837
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,256
Well, maybe you'd make senior if
you showed a bit of initiative.

838
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,416
What?!

839
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,255
You know,
just because you run Barfield

840
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,125
doesn't mean you run me,
my life, or my business.

841
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,995
You have no right
even to... to insinuate

842
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,092
that I might take on
what's-his-name!

843
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,636
Russell Morgan.

844
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,069
I thought you'd read the file.

845
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,448
Well, perhaps
you wouldn't be suitable

846
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,134
if you can't even remember
the man's name!

847
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,039
He has nothing to do with me!

848
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,840
But he has a lot to do with me
and that bastard Turnbull!

849
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,278
You said he was good.
Well, he is.

850
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,248
And all I want is somebody
as good as he is to represent...

851
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,649
[Sighs]
Oh, forget it. Just forget it.

852
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,984
I'm sorry.
I presumed too much.

853
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,989
Put it down to an addiction
to Bisodol.

854
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,719
- Well, go to bed, then.
- I am going!

855
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,653
Look.

856
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,895
Just give me
your professional opinion.

857

[Sighs]

858
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,434
You see,
I think that the prison service

859
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,308
was Russell Morgan's life.

860
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,774
And I doubt that he will
ever be fit enough...

861
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,843
Well, mentally fit enough...
To work for them again.

862
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,480
He is such a nice man, Simon.

863
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,317
Such a good officer.

864
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,431
Is Anthony Turnbull the reason
you won't consider this?

865
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:57,203
No, it isn't
bloody Anthony Turnbull.

866
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,286
You may know everything there is
about running a prison,

867
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,939
but you know bugger-all
about the law.

868
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,881
I know that Turnbull
is making my officer feel

869
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,282
that it was his fault
that he was taken hostage!

870
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,285
No, Helen, he isn't.

871
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,412
He's attempting to prove

872
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,615
that his client was in
a serious state of ill health.

873
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,454
He only had inflammation
of the bowel!

874
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,654
And that without
the correct medical attention,

875
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,959
his client was forced
into taking the action

876
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,296
which subsequently resulted
in your officer's condition.

877
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,665
Whose side are you on?

878
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,728
Yours...
If you'll just be patient.

879
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,907
If Russell Morgan sues
the prison service,

880
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,246
he will get little
or no compensation,

881
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,310
because it is not responsible
for the cutbacks.

882
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:46,722
However, there's a possible
alternative...

883
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,919
Sue the people
who <i>are</i> responsible.

884
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,662
The Home Office?

885
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,925
Yes.

886
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,796
Now, it could have repercussions
for you.

887
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,427
If you encourage Morgan
to take them on,

888
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,497
they'll know,
and they won't like it.

889
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,845
You still want me to take on
his case?

No way.

1082
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,087
It's for Kevin Watts.

1083
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,394
All right.
Take him a few biscuits, yeah?

1084
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,162
Aye, do.

1085
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,632
I've brought your cocoa, mate.

1086
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,469
If you don't want your
choccy biscuits, I'll have them.

1087
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,201
Oh, bleeding hell, Kev.
You been run over?

1088
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,277
You're in a right mess.

1089
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,543
What have they done to you,
mate?

1090
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,549
I fell on me head, you know.

1091
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,211
I'm acting up, actually.
It's cushty in here, isn't it?

1092
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,481
Give us...

1093
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,290
What?

1094
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,885
G-Give me me f-fucking cocoa.

1095
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,820
All right.

1098
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,375
No!

1099
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,780
No! No!
No!

1100
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,318
[Muffled screams]

1101
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,685
The specials have not found
anything.

1102
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,320
We checked every tape
in their cell.

1103
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,490
- Nothing.
- So Buffy was lying.

1104
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,261
They both lied.

1105
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,962
It means we could keep this
balaclava business internal.

1106
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,198
No, we don't, Gary.

1107
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,673
Every officer in Barfield
must be trusted.

1108
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,370
What Hully did
was a criminal offense.

1109
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,879
- I stand corrected.
- However...

1110
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,242
cell searches
are within our rights,

1111
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,428
even more so when they're
threatening to blow up Barfield

1112
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,385
with Semtex.

1113
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,631
Get rid of a lot of aggravation,
though, wouldn't it, eh?

1114
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,453
Very true.
[Laughs]

1115
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,523
Anyone fancy a pint?

1116
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,493
Ah. That's the best offer
I've had all night.

1117
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,222
- Come on, Gary.
- Allow me.

1118
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,786
Oh. Thank you very much.
I say.

1119
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:26,990
Oh!

âª Three little maids from school
are we âª

What are you keeping me waiting
for?

1128
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,117
Get back to your pad, Bert.

1129
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,654
You know the rules.

1130
