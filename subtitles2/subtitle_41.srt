My first out-of-body experience.

hallucinogenic drugs, LSD.

201
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,522
Most people don't understand
what LSD actually does.

202
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,192
It raises the level of vibration

203
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,532
and allows you to exist
on a different plane.

204
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,997
There are lots of
different planes of existence,

205
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,043
different realities.

206
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,342
We all vibrate
on a certain level.

207
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,677
If that level is raised,
everything is heightened.

208
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,854
The physical body
is only one plane of reality.

209
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,017
But we can leave that plane.

210
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,858
Then we have no need
for the physical body.

211
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,060
That's what happens after death.

212
