Travel is useful, it exercises the imagination.
All the rest is disappointment and fatigue.

3
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:21,539
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.

4
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,026
It goes from life to death. People, animals,
cities, things, all are imagined.

5
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,368
It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative.
LittrÃ© says so, and he's never wrong.

6
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,876
And besides, in the first place,
anyone can do as much.

7
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,416
You just have to close your eyes.

8
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,166
It's on the other side of life.

10
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,415
Fire!

11
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,699
You're a real pain in the ass!

12
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,208
Hey, one of my Asians just croaked!

13
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,750
Enough!

14
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,832
They even have cocktails with cherries.
Remember?

15
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,375
Hey, jerks!

16
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,284
I'll screw you!

17
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,828
I'll screw you!

18
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,248
Have you seen Ermanno?

19
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,912
- I'll screw you! Now!
- Get lost!

20
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,531
What the hell?

21
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,784
My phone's been stolen!

22
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,785
What are your doggies called?

23
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,702
I have a pet too... a codfish.

24
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,114
Did you call me by my first name?

25
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,998
Did you?

26
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,497
How dare you!

27
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,617
So you're an asshole!

28
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,782
I'm starring in two TV dramas...

29
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,997
I'm playing a Pope in one,

30
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,414
and a junkie on the road to recovery
in the other.

31
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,574
Impressive!

32
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,409
No theatre work?

33
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,783
I'm supposed to do
Shakespeare with Pietro, but...

34
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,997
it has to be at least
three hours long,

35
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,371
be an ambitious project,

36
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,994
and no more small cities!

37
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,416
I'm trying to write a piece
for theatre, and the concept is...

38
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,488
- What about you?
- I might give up acting.

39
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,115
In this shitty country there are never
any good female roles.

40
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,290
I'll write my first novel,
a Proust-style piece.

41
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,327
Really?
Proust is my favourite writer!

42
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,657
Along with Ammaniti...

43
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,035
What a coincidence.

44
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,624
Who is that woman?

45
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,865
Don't you recognise her?
It's Lorena.

46
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,494
Who?

47
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,827
An ex TV showgirl, now in
full physical and mental decline.

48
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,242
Never seen her! But then
I've never had a television.

49
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:42,038
Viola, I know you don't have one.
You tell me all the time.

50
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,958
- What does she do now?
- Nothing, of course.

51
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,624
Happy birthday, Jep!

52
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,996
Happy birthday, Rome!

53
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,832
La Colita!

54
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,247
<i>To this question, as kids,</i>

55
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,865
<i>my friends always gave
the same answer...</i>

56
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,241
<i>"pussy."</i>

57
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,616
<i>Whereas I answered...</i>

58
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,661
<i>"the smell of old people's houses."</i>

59
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,123
<i>The question was:</i>

60
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:24,032
<i>"What do you like most, really,
in life?"</i>

61
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,413
<i>I was destined for sensibility.</i>

62
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,739
<i>I was destined to become a writer.</i>

63
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:38,328
<i>I was destined to become
Jep Gambardella.</i>

64
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,208
THE GREAT BEAUTY

65
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,614
You paid no attention to me
tonight!

66
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,833
Romano, don't start moaning,
we're not an item.

67
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,666
- You liked that guy?
- I like everyone and no one.

68
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,914
But it's always me you're with
when you like no one.

69
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,746
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure. What time are you leaving?

70
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,742
- In three hours.
- Three hours?

71
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,083
Then I should crash on your sofa...

72
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,074
Go home, I need to pack
and I don't want anyone around.

73
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,117
- But I live miles away.
- See you at 8:00.

74
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,248
Goodnight.

75
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,663
Guys?

76
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,038
Guys?

77
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,415
Children!

78
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,993
Run along!

79
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,367
Catellani?

80
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,408
The best, of course.

81
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,162
Did Catellani the tailor
make your suit?

82
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>There was no doubt
about Malagna's shady intentions.</i>

83
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,497
<i>The girl should be rescued
at any cost, without loss of time.</i>

84
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,157
- Sir, you drank!
- Just enough to forget my birthday.

85
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,249
- You want infusion?
- Heavens, no!

86
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,205
- I got you a present.
- How sweet!

87
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,113
This is a lucky charm from my country.

88
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,079
Good thing it's lucky,
because it's pretty ugly.

89
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,738
Keep it on your bedside
and stop complaining!

90
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,079
I will! And thanks.

91
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,738
Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.

92
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,038
You're funny when you call me that!

93
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,453
I don't love you!

94
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,789
Brilliant!

95
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,873
Did you enjoy the performance?

96
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,039
Parts of it.

97
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,993
That violent head-butt
made me understand many things.

98
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,157
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Or the end?

99
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,156
You know, Talia Concept
loves to provoke.

100
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,954
Don't bother, there are more
important things than provoking me.

101
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,948
And this habit of speaking
in the third person is unbearable.

102
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,577
What are you reading?

103
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,324
I don't need to read, I live on
vibrations, extra-sensory ones.

104
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:08,156
Extrasensoriality aside,

105
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,615
what do you mean by vibrations?

106
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:16,030
The poetry of vibrations cannot be
described with the vulgarity of words.

107
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,949
Well, try at least.

108
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,489
I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain jack shit.

109
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:26,076
So I'll write: "Lives on vibrations,
but doesn't know what they are."

110
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,622
Hold on, for fuck's sake,
I never said I don't know what they are.

111
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:32,618
All right, then what is a vibration?

112
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,957
I'm starting to dislike this interview,
I sense conflictuality in you.

113
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,414
- Conflictuality as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.

114
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:45,365
Try to calm down
and tune into my poetic frequency.

115
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,790
- You're right.
- Good.

116
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,617
Thanks.

117
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,994
Let's talk about my mum's
abusive boyfriend.

118
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,823
No! I want to know
what a vibration is.

119
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,579
It's my radar to intercept the world.

120
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,830
Your radar... meaning?

121
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,574
You're a pain in the ass, a provoker.

122
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,199
A provoker who can't stand a provoker,
that's fascism.

123
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,330
I'm a fascist? Fuck off!

124
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,532
We got off to a bad start...

125
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,697
Talia Concept wants to be interviewed
by your paper, it has many readers.

126
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,534
But you're biased.

127
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,536
Write about how she has sex
with her fiancÃ© 11 times a day,

128
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,533
he's a talented conceptual artist,

129
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,789
he covers basketballs with confetti!
He's sensational!

130
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,330
Talia Concept is talking about things
that are meaningless to me.

131
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:41,493
All I've heard
is unpublishable fluff.

132
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,031
You can't charm me
with things like:

133
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,081
"I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain."

134
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,826
Our paper has a core
of cultured readers

135
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,613
that don't want to be taken for fools.
I work for that core.

136
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,410
So let me talk about my eventful,

137
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,375
difficult but necessary
journey as an artist!

138
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,117
Necessary for who?

139
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,623
For heaven's sake, madam,
what is a vibration?

140
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,534
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

141
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,073
You're an obsessed jerk!

142
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:15,078
I'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of a higher stature.

143
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,533
A piece of advice:
when you speak to my editor,

144
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,494
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf, you know.

145
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,083
This trait of hers
caused her much suffering.

146
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,367
Jep, this interview is a hoot!

147
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:34,583
Maybe, but don't send me to interview
someone who head-butts walls again.

148
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,790
- You know what the trick is?
- Foam rubber.

149
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,582
Amateur dramatics isn't dead.

150
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:44,952
Did you get offended
about the stature comment?

151
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,781
Don't be silly!
That's the funniest bit!

152
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,162
I'm a dwarf, it's no secret.

153
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,367
It's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.

154
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,997
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.

155
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,704
But you haven't had the career
you deserve.

156
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,413
Maybe I don't have much to say...

157
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,281
Bullshit, you're lazy.
You never leave Rome.

158
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,366
Why don't you go to Giglio

159
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:13,789
to do that report on the Concordia
I've asked you to do 50 times?

160
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:21,039
Re-heated rice is always tastier
than freshly cooked rice.

161
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,662
The old is better than the new.

162
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,331
Plans tonight, chÃ©rie?

163
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,156
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, said:

164
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:34,161
"Tonight I'll do two things,
eat soup and have a shag."

165
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,787
Two things that contradict each other.

166
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,992
That's what I'd say too,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone:

167
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:44,451
"No, Dadina, they don't,
because they're both hot."

168
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,782
You're a hypocrite, Mariella!

169
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,915
You hurt me.

170
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,157
And everyone knows.

171
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,785
You're a hypocrite!

172
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,156
You hurt me!

173
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,162
And everyone knows
the only virtue is hypocrisy.

174
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,206
Like that.

175
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,874
Good.

176
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,790
Great.

177
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,365
There's a publishing house
in Ancona, it's not that small,

178
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,574
they want an interview book about you.

179
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:29,785
Another interview book?
We're obsessed with interviews!

180
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:33,116
Can't you hear them?
"As I always say"... to who?

181
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,785
Forget it!

182
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,583
And honestly,
who'll buy a book called:

183
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:40,908
"Visions and revisions.
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy"?

184
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,914
It's a serious title!

185
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,910
Unfortunately in this country,
in order to be taken seriously,

186
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,282
you have to take yourself seriously.

187
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,909
I only wrote one novel, 40 years ago.
Impossible to find too...

188
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,040
Bullshit, "The Human Apparatus"
was a masterpiece!

189
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,200
It even won the... what was it?

190
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:01,030
- The Bancarella prize.
- Shit, the Bancarella prize!

191
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:04,705
You're very kind, but forget it...
it'd be too pompous.

192
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,365
I can't, you'll put me
in an awkward position.

193
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,783
I've agreed and I've even accepted
an advance...

194
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,410
- How much?
- 1,500 euros.

195
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,113
Give it back, I'll give you 1,500 euros.

196
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:19,623
By the way,
I spoke to the theatre people.

197
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,908
They'll give you three nights
but you pay for the lights.

198
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,914
Who cares about that!

199
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,115
Jep, this is great news.

200
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,368
It's really great news.
Thank you!

201
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,081
What's wrong?
I was talking...

202
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,915
Are you still up?

203
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,329
It's time to go to bed.

204
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,532
That's Viola Bartoli, Bartoli's widow.

205
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,368
The guy who was killed,
the actual Bartoli.

206
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:49,790
Viola has a 50 metre yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the Nazi.

207
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,115
You know what I call Viola?

208
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,911
- No, what?
- "Too-good-to-poo".

209
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,739
- I don't understand.
- Because she's pernickety.

210
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,281
Usually pernickety people don't poo.

211
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,581
When I introduced Trumeau
to my family, my father said:

212
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:08,371
"Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poo?"

213
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,906
- How gross!
- It's not as bad as you think.

214
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:15,782
Actually, my wife and I are the only
couple in Italy who are in love.

215
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,907
Orietta, watch out for Lello.

216
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,749
Yes, I know.

217
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,790
He's the world's greatest salesman,
he cons everyone.

218
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:26,116
In no time he'll get you to spend
every cent on whatever he's selling.

219
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,655
You always flatter me.

220
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:31,578
Just because I express myself well
doesn't mean I'm always working!

221
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:33,782
- What do you do?
- I sell toys.

222
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,873
Not just in a shop,

223
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,532
he's a wholesaler on a global scale,
he even sells to the Chinese!

224
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,947
What about him?

225
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:45,457
Don't you know him? Sebastiano Paf,
perhaps Italy's greatest poet.

226
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:51,118
He wrote: "Upwards and onwards
with life, down with reminiscence."

227
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,957
He's on the Dukan Diet,
so Dadina won't leave him.

228
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,492
- Is he with her?
- He is, but she...

229
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,118
Like at high school.

230
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,158
Why doesn't he ever talk?

231
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,365
Because he listens.

232
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,700
- Stop sniffing up with your nose?
- Bugger off.

233
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,073
Jep's found a theatre for me.

234
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:15,705
- Ronconi will feel threatened...
- Come on, that joke's old.

235
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,207
Do you want the lead role?

236
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,118
I'm no longer an actress,
I'm a writer now.

237
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,456
Maybe...

238
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,038
Maybe I'll make a film.

239
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,533
We were talking...

240
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,416
- Viola, darling!
- Help me, I'm worried about my son.

241
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,665
- What can I do?
- Why don't you talk to him?

242
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,162
You always say you're good
with strangers...

243
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,407
That's the problem, I'm too good.

244
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:47,951
- Is he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.

245
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,788
Take him to a psychiatrist, they're
pragmatic: Ativan, Prozac and so on.

246
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,783
That stuff makes him feel worse.

247
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,621
Relax, he's always been odd,
he is what he is.

248
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,956
By the way, have you tried
AhÃ¨'s endive quiche?

249
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:05,781
It's the first time she's made it
and it's better than my mum's,

250
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:09,407
please, you must try some!

251
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,866
You changed your hair colour.

252
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,041
I feel Pirandello-esque recently...

253
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,624
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.

254
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:30,413
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only
interesting one today.

255
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,873
I'm from Milan, to be honest...
I find Romans...

256
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,661
unbearable!

257
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,583
The best people in Rome
are the tourists.

258
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,160
Take Italy...

259
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,740
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.

260
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,405
A country of designers and cooks!

261
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,618
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,

262
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:53,956
be such a pessimist and a defeatist?
You're dark.

263
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,790
- Dark?
- Yes.

264
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,790
I heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loans sharks

265
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,701
to pay her hairdressing debts.

266
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,534
Jep says I'm dark!

267
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,290
Gisella's really sunk that low?

268
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,655
Rome is the only city in the world
where Marxism has truly existed.

269
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,784
You can't excel over others
for more than a week,

270
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,164
you're immediately brought back
to mediocrity.

271
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,616
Rome is pure collectivism.

272
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,122
Pure collectivism.
Stefania, what utter nonsense!

273
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,740
Do you know that Flaubert wanted to
write a book about Nothing?

274
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:30,282
If he'd met you, we'd have had
a great book, what a shame!

275
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,159
You're a misogynist.

276
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:37,416
It's not all about you, I'm not
a misogynist, I'm a misanthropist.

277
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,782
When hate's involved,
one must aim high.

278
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,874
You're a dark man.

279
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,454
I'm a transparent person,
without a doubt!

280
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,035
I don't understand...

281
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,326
Lello!

282
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,409
Aren't you stopping tonight?

283
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,448
Mum!
When I see you I blush!

284
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,165
Andrea...

285
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,121
- You're crazy.
- No, Mum, I'm not crazy!

286
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:04,367
I've got problems.

287
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,956
"As the light flashed,
love sat down in the corner."

288
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,952
"Shy and distracted as it was."

289
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,457
"This is why
we could tolerate life no longer."

290
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:18,452
Gosh,
no one's quoted me for years!

291
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,285
I read your book as a teenager,
I've never forgotten the end.

292
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,910
Stop right there, you're stroking
my ego in a dangerous way.

293
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,623
You must've been deeply in love
when you wrote it.

294
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,160
Moravia made the same comment,
more or less.

295
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,782
Even though he worded it
a bit better.

296
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,041
I once saw Piazza Navona
covered in snow.

297
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,662
Really? What was it like?

298
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,284
White!

299
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,782
When I come to Rome I live there.

300
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,413
Deep in the outskirts...

301
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,873
What job do you do?

302
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,287
Me? I'm rich.

303
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,449
Great job.

304
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,956
You didn't enjoy it.

305
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,573
I know I'm not very good.

306
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,581
Why do you say that?

307
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:12,203
Plus it's so sad being good,
you risk becoming deft.

308
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,490
It didn't seem like you cared much.

309
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,371
You're very beautiful, Orietta,
very, very beautiful.

310
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,332
I take photos, you know.
Of myself.

311
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,499
At all times of the day,
to get to know myself.

312
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:31,323
- With the self-timer, with my phone...
- Interesting.

313
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,825
My Facebook friends say
I take great photos.

314
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,613
I bet there are some of you naked...

315
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,697
- A few.
- I knew it!

316
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,411
Do you want to see them?

317
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,451
- Of course.
- I'll get my computer.

318
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:12,074
<i>The most important thing I discovered
a few days after turning 65</i>

319
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:17,159
<i>is that I can't waste any more time
doing things I don't want to do.</i>

320
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,490
<i>When I arrived in Rome,</i>

321
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,908
<i>at the age of 26,</i>

322
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,082
<i>I took a plunge, rather quickly,</i>

323
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,327
<i>almost without realising it,</i>

324
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,538
<i>into what might be defined
as the whirlpool of the high life.</i>

325
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:08,909
<i>But I didn't just want
to live the high life.</i>

326
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,331
Sacconi should be in charge.

327
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,374
Antonini's a fucking pain in the ass!

328
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:21,327
<i>I wanted to be
the king of the high life.</i>

329
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,073
<i>And I succeeded.</i>

330
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,539
<i>I didn't just want
to go to parties.</i>

331
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,910
<i>I wanted to have the power
to make them a failure.</i>

332
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,536
- Gambardella?
- That's me.

333
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,329
Sorry for showing up like this,
without warning...

334
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,872
I'm Alfredo Marti.

335
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:21,206
Nice to meet you, I'm Jep,
but my house is this one.

336
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,532
I don't want to bother you.

337
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,826
How can I help you?

338
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,699
I'm Elisa De Santis' husband.

339
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,080
Did you have children?

340
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,909
No.

341
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,574
I couldn't.

342
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,456
But I could.

343
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,290
I could.

344
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,785
I'm sorry.

345
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,332
Forgive me.

346
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,828
She could too.

347
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,032
Elisa died.

348
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,124
Yesterday.

349
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,039
- Come in, I'll make some coffee.
- No.

350
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:39,116
It would hurt too much to see
what Elisa always desired.

351
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,749
Alfredo, if you need anything,
you know where I live.

352
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,165
Don't leave me alone, please.
Don't leave me.

353
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,329
Love, sitting in the corner,
was shy.

354
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,738
But not distracted.

355
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,489
She always loved you.

356
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,623
With immense focus.

357
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,285
We were married for 35 years...

358
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:35,746
but Elisa always loved you.

359
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,038
What are you saying?

360
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,832
Elisa and I went out together
when we were kids.

361
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,496
She left me, I think,
it was so long ago I don't remember.

362
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,747
Yes, she left you.

363
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,865
On September 8th, 1970.

364
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,624
Exactly...

365
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,749
Alfredo, you're distraught now,
that's normal.

366
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,913
I'm not distraught.

367
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:08,456
Elisa only ever loved one man.

368
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,492
- You.
- How can you say that?

369
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,624
I never saw Elisa again,
you were together for a lifetime!

370
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:18,157
I found a diary of hers, with a lock.

371
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,540
And I broke the lock off.

372
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,374
I write for a living, believe me...

373
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,873
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies...

374
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,579
I was only a good companion.

375
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,831
That's all she wrote about me.

376
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:46,704
35 years together...

377
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:51,408
and I'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.

378
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,076
Here, Alfredo.

379
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,622
What'll you do now?

380
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,416
What I've always done.

381
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,828
I'll live in adoration of her.

382
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,038
What's he doing?

383
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:57,915
Stop!

384
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,992
Jep!

385
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,616
Well done!

386
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,997
He made it!

387
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:50,246
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.

388
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,373
Francesca!

389
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,909
Who are you?

390
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,789
Who am I?

391
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:28,165
- I am...
- No, you're nobody.

392
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,623
Nobody?

393
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,165
But I...

394
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,451
Francesca, where on earth were you?

395
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,747
I've been looking for you
for an hour!

396
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,364
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.

397
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:19,329
Sir is strange.

398
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,291
I don't like that,
I prefer you to be sad.

399
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,113
Are you going to bed?

400
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,408
You won't believe it, but last night
I went to bed at 22:30.

401
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,580
Now I don't know what to do.

402
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:32,867
Morning is an unknown object to me.

403
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,832
Unknown.

404
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,738
Sir can help me clean the house then.

405
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,373
- Sir can't, sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.

406
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:45,476
"But what signified this turbid
seething of servile passions"

407
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:49,915
"seen through that silence
which surrounds Rome"

408
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,241
"with its nine circles
like a river of Tartarus?"

409
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:57,031
"Is there a new nation struggling
within the walls of the city?"

410
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:01,994
"From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapour ascends like smoke"

411
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:06,327
"and works like a magic philtre
in the blood of some men"

412
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:12,451
"producing a form of heroic madness
unlike any other."

413
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:19,283
What do you think?
Shit, it's powerful, don't you think?

414
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,330
Why the hell do an adaptation
of D'Annunzio for the stage?

415
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,333
D'Annunzio has always been
paradigmatic...

416
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:30,992
You think that certain
intellectual feats give you dignity,

417
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:34,034
and that others are better than you,
but you're wrong!

418
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,161
Try and write something of your own,
like...

419
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,990
a feeling, or sorrow...

420
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,916
I've known you ages
but you've never been here.

421
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:47,366
Don't get big-headed, you've got
a room in a student flat...

422
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:50,789
Are you going out with
that gloomy girl you're always with?

423
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,323
I wish!
I've tried it on 7,000 times.

424
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,954
I've never gotten a kiss, not one!

425
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,697
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.

426
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,290
- She's complicated.
- She's a bitch.

427
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,159
Trust me, you're too kind.

428
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:08,368
I can tell her type from a mile off,
I don't even need to meet them.

429
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,955
- What are you doing with that hat?
- My morning exercise.

430
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,531
- That's exercise?
- Yes!

431
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,454
Do you know how many women
you've been with?

432
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,533
No, I'm rubbish at maths.

433
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,416
I've always been good at maths.

434
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,617
It's six, I introduced you to them.

435
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,123
Seven.

436
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,164
- Seven?
- Seven.

437
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,160
- When did number seven happen?
- Last summer.

438
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:36,539
A friend of my sister's back home
when I went to see my folks.

439
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,660
She runs a shop...

440
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,034
- She's nice.
- That means she's a dog.

441
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,163
What about you and Orietta?

442
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,032
- Who's Orietta?
- Don't you know?

443
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,205
She was at your house...

444
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,833
A real beauty.

445
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,702
At my age, a beauty isn't enough.

446
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,158
I might take up writing again.

447
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,738
That's great news!

448
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,165
Has something happened?

449
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:24,541
Why?

450
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:29,698
You want to write again after all
these years, something's happened.

451
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,165
Something always happens in Rome.
Nothing's happened.

452
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,450
What are you looking at?

453
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:45,948
Come here.

454
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,031
They met at university
10 days ago.

455
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,872
They haven't stopped kissing
for 10 days.

456
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,863
This generation of youths
horrifies me.

457
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:17,158
Supported by this State for years,
when they realise they're smart,

458
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:21,908
they go study or work in America or
London, forgetting about the support.

459
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,074
They have no civil vocation.

460
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,824
As a young girl, in the occupied arts
department, I oozed civil vocation.

461
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,743
- Is that so?
- Yes, why?

462
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,032
- Come off it...
- What do you know?

463
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,699
In those years you were in Naples
being a loafer with posh girls

464
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,872
and writing your only novelette.

465
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:40,866
I didn't notice that history
was being made.

466
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:45,865
Novelette? It was a masterpiece
of Italian literature!

467
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,040
I confirm that Jep and civil vocation
never got along,

468
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,956
he was lazy and the other hyperactive.

469
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:55,286
Romano, stop sucking up to your idol,
you're pathetic!

470
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,956
"The Human Apparatus"
was a narrow-minded, frivolous book

471
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,040
and pretentious too, like its title.
Jep knows that.

472
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:05,781
- That's why he stopped there.
- Sorry, what about you then?

473
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,406
I tried changing things
with literature.

474
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:12,832
I wrote 11 novels, and a book about
the Party's official history.

475
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:16,206
You're forgetting your contribution
to that reality show...

476
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:19,083
"Girl Farm."

477
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,911
Television can be
a very formative experience!

478
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:24,080
I always go when I'm invited.

479
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,824
I get my hands dirty, I try things...

480
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,990
I don't spend my life being a snob.

481
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:33,906
Are you saying that a socially
committed writer is advantaged,

482
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:36,915
and safeguarded,
compared to a novelist

483
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,951
who deals with, how can I say...
with feelings?

484
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,950
Of course she is!

485
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,076
The cause someone commits
their life to isn't secondary.

486
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,282
Like creating a family,

487
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:52,282
dedicating oneself with sacrifice to
raising and educating one's children.

488
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:56,286
Eusebio and I have four children,
we plan the future together.

489
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:59,030
I work hard
to be both a mother and a woman,

490
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:03,700
but at the end of the day, I feel
I've done something important.

491
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:08,740
So if we don't have children we should
contemplate the idea of suicide?

492
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,790
- I don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.

493
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:16,073
Dadina, I admire you greatly.
You're a badass.

494
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,124
Do you use "badass"
in any of your 11 novels?

495
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,747
Yes, I do, I try to be modern.

496
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,907
- Modernity is badass.
- De gustibus.

497
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,455
What great conviction!

498
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,582
Should I envy you or be repelled?

499
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,866
Yes, I have convictions.
I'm 53...

500
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,032
- You'd never know.
- Never.

501
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,952
I'm 53, I've suffered,
I bounced back,

502
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,033
and learned lots about life.

503
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,868
Well, I can see you have nothing
to say, at last.

504
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,748
I was drinking...

505
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:51,537
As we care about you,
we don't want to embarrass you.

506
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,535
You know, all this boastful talk,

507
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,957
all this serious ostentatiousness,
all this ego...

508
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:01,741
These harsh damning judgements
of yours

509
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:04,447
hide a certain fragility,
a feeling of inadequacy

510
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,699
and above all a series of untruths.

511
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:09,121
We care about you, we know you.

512
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:13,327
We also know our untruths
and for this, unlike you,

513
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:16,374
we end up talking about nonsense,
about trivial matters,

514
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,659
because we don't want
to revel in our pettiness.

515
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,997
What untruths are you talking about?

516
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,952
Everything I said is true,
it's what I am, what I believe in.

517
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:29,949
Please, I'm a gentleman.
Don't destroy my only certainty.

518
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:34,534
Tell me exactly what my lies are
and what my fragility is!

519
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,665
I'm a woman with balls, tell me!

520
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:42,537
"Woman with balls" would be too much
for any gentleman.

521
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,080
All right, Stefania, you asked for it.
In random order:

522
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:50,329
Your civil vocation during
your student days went unnoticed.

523
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:54,535
But another vocation of yours
is remembered by many,

524
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,578
the one practiced by you then,
in the university toilets.

525
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:03,452
You wrote about the Party because
you were its leader's mistress.

526
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,747
And your 11 novels,

527
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:09,454
published by a small publishing house
subsidised by the Party,

528
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:12,873
reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
newspapers,

529
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,947
are insignificant,
everyone says so.

530
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:19,283
I'm not saying my novelette
was any better,

531
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,746
I agree with you there.

532
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,743
Your relationship with Eusebio...

533
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,824
What relationship? Eusebio
loves Giordano, everyone knows.

534
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,958
He has for years.

535
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:35,373
They lunch every day
at the Pantheon, under the coat rack,

536
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:39,453
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
You all know but turn a blind eye.

537
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:44,533
Your dedication to your children,
with all the sacrifices entailed...

538
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,372
You work all week in TV,
go out every night,

539
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:51,874
even on Mondays, when popper
dealers don't even venture out.

540
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:56,367
You're never with your children,
not even on the long holidays you take.

541
00:56:56,625 --> 00:57:00,369
And plus you have a butler, a waiter,

542
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:05,749
a cook, a chauffeur
who drives the kids to school,

543
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,659
three babysitters, so...

544
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:12,248
how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?

545
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:15,915
These are the untruths and fragility
I'm talking about.

546
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:21,041
Stefania, mother and woman.

547
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:26,038
You're 53, with a life in tatters,
like the rest of us.

548
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:31,031
Instead of acting superior
and treating us with contempt,

549
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,249
you should look at us
with affection.

550
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,033
We're all on the brink of despair,

551
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,868
all we can do
is look each other in the face,

552
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:44,912
keep each other company,
joke a little, don't you agree?

553
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,614
Son of a bitch!

554
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,041
Egidio!

555
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:39,663
Bastard!
I haven't seen you in 30 years!

556
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,332
- I need to talk to you.
- Later! I'm busy, can't you see?

557
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,535
- Is this still your place?
- Luckily not, I sold it.

558
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,456
I'm still the manager though.

559
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:04,951
You're famous! You're always
in the gossip rags.

560
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,743
You're at all the VIP parties,
always with a girl!

561
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,748
You never come here...

562
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,454
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk!

563
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:16,079
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.

564
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:19,954
- I've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?

565
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,329
You artists are all the same!

566
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,741
I tell you I have a daughter
and you complain about her name!

567
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,748
What's wrong with "Ramona"?

568
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,743
Nothing, it's a name that implies
ambitions...

569
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,032
There's my daughter, you see?

570
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:48,243
She makes me so mad,
I've told her a million times!

571
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:50,325
You're too old for this!

572
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:54,079
Now these hot young Polish girls
rule the scene.

573
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:56,662
They're experts at turning tricks.

574
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,956
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.

575
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,875
But the world's no longer
sophisticated. Right, Jep?

576
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,364
I know, only you and I are.

577
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,414
That's right, goddammit!

578
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:11,246
But she wants to keep doing
this job, for the money.

579
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:14,659
I don't know why she always
needs fucking money.

580
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:18,657
- For drugs?
- I wish, we'd have a common interest.

581
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,617
She doesn't even drink beer.

582
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,950
I don't know what she spends
her money on, she's always broke.

583
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,743
- Do I seem like a loser?
- No, why?

584
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:31,082
Because I can hear myself talk,
I sound like a loser.

585
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,994
I'm nearly 70 and I have to work
till 6 in the morning every day.

586
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:38,538
I swapped cocaine for heroin
15 years ago.

587
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:42,531
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!

588
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,456
Could I be more of a loser?

589
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:49,283
But I'm not important,
it's her I worry about, I love her.

590
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:52,078
And I'm no loser there,
I'm a father.

591
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,413
And like all fathers, I'm worried.

592
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,290
What'll she do in a few years?

593
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:58,615
She can't be a stripper at 50!

594
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,656
- Why don't you help her?
- Me?

595
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:08,414
Don't you know any rich guys
who want a beautiful wife?

596
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:11,073
We could change her name,
that's no problem.

597
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,075
You'd do me a big favour.

598
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,958
I'm a writer, not a pimp.

599
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,074
Sorry, I was a bit vulgar.

600
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:22,078
Daddy's little girl, this is
my good friend, Jep Gambardella.

601
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:25,249
I'll leave you to it,
I need the toilet.

602
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,915
Be right back!

603
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:30,454
- Hi, I'm Jep.
- Ramona.

604
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,873
If you want a girl, get a Pole.

605
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:48,997
Are you kidding?

606
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:53,033
Who wants a girl?
Not me.

607
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,910
I really am an old friend
of your father.

608
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,283
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.

609
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,907
When I came to Rome,
I loved coming here.

610
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,908
Your father was a nice guy.

611
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:07,615
He taught me loads of things,
such as: vodka is uncouth.

612
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,039
How useful!

613
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,080
He asked me to find you a husband.

614
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,456
He's obsessed.
I'm not looking for a husband.

615
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,830
Well, you should be.

616
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,242
- A family's a beautiful thing.
- I know.

617
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:26,457
But I'm not cut out
for beautiful things.

618
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,575
What's wrong?

619
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:46,077
I feel old.

620
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,201
You're no spring chicken.

621
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:05,989
Madame Ardant!

622
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,531
Excuse me.

623
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,121
You're excused.

624
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,332
May I...

625
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,701
say something...

626
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,456
a bit cheeky?

627
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,827
Please do.

628
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:22,618
When I saw you...

629
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,952
in "The Woman Next Door"...

630
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,990
I fell in love with you.

631
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,287
May I say something cheeky too?

632
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:36,655
Certainly.

633
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,332
I would've liked to have been
the woman next door.

634
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,037
Why?

635
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,201
To die of love.

636
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,621
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

637
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:31,238
De Oliveira is older than me

638
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:33,159
and he still makes films.

639
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,323
I want to make another film too.

640
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,409
What would this new film be about?

641
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,663
Well, after...

642
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:47,073
32 films which, all in all,
had nothing important to say...

643
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:53,661
I'd like to leave behind
a very simple concept.

644
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,322
Maestro, nothing important?

645
01:06:56,541 --> 01:07:01,033
You forever influenced
the imagination of millions of people.

646
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:04,040
What would
this very simple concept be?

647
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,030
I'd like to tell my viewers:

648
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:12,866
Respect your curiosity.

649
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:15,115
Indulge it.

650
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:17,200
Many restrain it.

651
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,951
Why?

652
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,450
Because they're lazy
apathetic moralists,

653
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:26,330
they're sceptics.

654
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,078
And... ignorant as well.

655
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,281
What was cinema for you?

656
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,077
Cinema...

657
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:43,284
is a chance to survive...

658
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:49,411
the disappointments
that reality hands us every day.

659
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,369
In truth...

660
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,747
time, in defining reality,

661
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,740
renders it disappointing.

662
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:06,039
But if reality is disjointed,
broken apart...

663
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,740
re-examined...

664
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,032
re-elaborated...

665
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:15,114
it can become a wonderful sight.

666
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:19,452
Does real life not offer
this same wonderful sight?

667
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:22,203
There's only one circumstance

668
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:25,242
in which reality measures up to cinema.

669
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,034
When?

670
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,744
When love bursts in.

671
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:38,538
In that moment, time no longer beats
with the same rhythm of reality.

672
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,413
Want to know what my next film
will be about?

673
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,533
I'd be honoured.

674
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,916
It's about a girl.

675
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:57,613
Whose eyes change colour
every single time

676
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:02,536
she opens and closes them.

677
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,413
She becomes famous,

678
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:10,958
people adore her though
they've never heard her say a word.

679
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,574
Just silence...

680
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:18,157
and these eyes.

681
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,456
Blue...

682
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,947
green...

683
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,950
black.

684
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,375
Then blue again.

685
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:31,033
Fascinating.

686
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,993
Know where this idea came from?

687
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:37,325
From my first fascination

688
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:40,451
which wasn't for a girl, no...

689
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:43,034
It was for...

690
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:46,207
the first traffic light
installed in Milan

691
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:50,784
at the intersection
of Piazza del Duomo and Via Torino.

692
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:57,747
I believe it was on April 12, 1925.

693
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:03,039
My father put me on his shoulders
because there was a crowd...

694
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,699
Can you imagine? A crowd...

695
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:11,875
gathered to see a traffic light.

696
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,914
What a beauty...

697
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,617
what a great beauty.

698
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:26,663
- This is going to be a great interview.
- Tell me...

699
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:31,658
is Dadina still the editor
of your paper?

700
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,197
Yes.

701
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:38,243
Dadina and I had a tempestuous affair.

702
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:42,283
But it happened ages ago.

703
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,374
Dadina...

704
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:50,624
was an amazing and mysterious lover.

705
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:55,082
Her mysteriousness made me crazy
with jealousy, of course.

706
01:10:57,083 --> 01:11:00,082
I can assure you that Dadina was...

707
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:05,205
was a woman who kept her lovers
awake at night.

708
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:10,121
- Don't include that please.
- I'm a gentleman.

709
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,993
That's my only certainty.

710
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,452
- Gambardella?
- Yes?

711
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,450
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Of course.

712
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:58,083
- Spying on me?
- No, I was going to knock.

713
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,994
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.

714
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:18,573
- What brings you here?
- Nothing, I'm just curious.

715
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,365
- I told you what I think.
- I've no hidden agenda.

716
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:28,116
Do you think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?

717
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,531
Perhaps they just want to talk,

718
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:34,536
driven by simple and harmless
curiosity.

719
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,948
- That's never happened to me.
- It has now.

720
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:41,074
Wouldn't armbands be more
comfortable?

721
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,035
Yes, but they irritate my armpits.

722
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,157
Any plans for lunch?

723
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,241
I'm going to my mum's with my dad.

724
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:52,662
So where's the dog?

725
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,034
What dog?

726
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,366
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.

727
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:03,034
I had a Labrador, but 9 years ago
he got fed up and left me.

728
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:05,783
Labradors are dumb.

729
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,041
And Cocker Spaniels are dumb too.

730
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,706
Good morning.

731
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:49,074
This is what you call rhythm.

732
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,582
Hi, Jep.

733
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,158
Hi, Antonello.

734
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:15,083
- You know Venditti?
- I know everyone.

735
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:18,999
It must be very satisfying
knowing so many people!

736
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,956
You're guaranteed to be unhappy.

737
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,200
Have people let you down?

738
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,907
I've let them down.

739
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,201
Andrea! Are you with your mum?

740
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:32,241
- She's parking.
- How are you?

741
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:33,992
Not well.

742
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:37,165
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.

743
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,915
Proust is scary.

744
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,082
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this afternoon.

745
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:45,290
But it's evening already
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.

746
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:49,239
Turgenev said:
"Death looked at me, noticing me."

747
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,994
Don't take these writers
so seriously!

748
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,329
Who should I take seriously then?

749
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,908
Nothing, apart from the menu,
of course.

750
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:04,665
Things are too complicated to be
understood by one individual.

751
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:09,074
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.

752
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,666
- Your reply?
- My reply?

753
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,829
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.

754
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,031
- Good evening.
- Viola.

755
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:25,450
Darling, why don't you
get a table for us?

756
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:31,364
How does he seem?

757
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,706
- He's better.
- Good, very good.

758
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:36,660
He's much better, I'm so happy!

759
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,872
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course!

760
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,701
On Thursday I'm inexplicably free.

761
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:46,121
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?
She's dating her personal trainer.

762
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,372
Really? It doesn't show.

763
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:51,951
- I invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?

764
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:55,538
She's nasty, you know.
She's like the devil!

765
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:57,831
Really? You think so?

766
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:01,413
I see her at yoga twice a week.

767
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,326
- You'll come?
- Of course.

768
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,074
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.

769
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:08,083
Goodbye.

770
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:15,740
Watch that table carefully,
but don't let them notice you looking.

771
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:21,412
Waiter? Champagne, please.
Cristal.

772
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:24,368
You can't imagine how much one learns

773
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:28,239
by living alongside
a cluster of religious institutes.

774
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,660
So that was your first time?

775
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:48,198
Yes, he didn't think he'd been good,

776
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,869
too quick, he said.

777
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,206
So, out of anger or to let off steam,
I'm not sure which,

778
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:58,031
he got a football
and played with it furiously!

779
01:17:58,416 --> 01:17:59,697
And you?

780
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,411
I didn't enjoy making love with him,

781
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:07,656
but seeing him with a football
was an unforgettable thing!

782
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:12,156
He became really good,
he played on the national team.

783
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:19,238
Your dad said you spend everything
you earn.

784
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:21,988
What on? You can tell me.

785
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:27,458
Maybe one day. But why didn't you
write another book?

786
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,323
Because I went out too much
at night.

787
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,324
Rome makes you waste a lot of time.

788
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:39,450
It's distracting.
Writing requires focus and peace.

789
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,038
That's not much of an answer.

790
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:45,658
You have plenty of peace here,
it's like being in the country.

791
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:51,078
I wrote in short spurts.
I was a sprint-style writer.

792
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:58,324
I told you about my first time...

793
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,909
but you've told me nothing.
It's your turn now.

794
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:14,532
On an island...
one summer.

795
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,740
I was...

796
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,117
18, she was 20.

797
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,789
At the lighthouse, at night.

798
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,075
I went to kiss her,
she turned away.

799
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,990
I was disappointed.

800
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,535
But then she turned to look at me.

801
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:40,531
She brushed me with her lips...

802
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,916
she smelled of flowers.

803
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:49,076
I didn't move,
I wasn't able to move.

804
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:55,074
Then she took a step back...

805
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,326
and said...

806
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,786
She took a step back.

807
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,659
And said...

808
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,829
I'm going home, it's late.

809
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,034
Want to come to a party
tomorrow night?

810
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,582
Outstanding!

811
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,114
Did you want us to die
of fright tonight?

812
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:30,575
You won't believe it,
but I love knife throwers.

813
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:33,582
A true likeness,
especially the hips.

814
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,242
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
It'll look great on the mantelpiece.

815
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,578
Geronimo, you've moved me.

816
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,122
In the depths of my intimacy,
you moved me.

817
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:13,614
God bless you, Jep!

818
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,581
This is Ramona.

819
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,534
What a unique and marvellous creature.

820
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,537
- Is he taking the piss?
- It's hard to know.

821
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,326
I was being honest.

822
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,787
I'm just sorry you missed
Geronimo D.

823
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,160
- What a tragedy!
- Come in, make yourselves at home.

824
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,204
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio.

825
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,623
The greatest modern art collector
in this debauched country.

826
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,329
What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?

827
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,326
I don't know.

828
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:43,831
Jep's proving to be a disappointment.

829
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,116
- Good evening, countess.
- Hello, you're looking well.

830
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:51,706
I wish I could say that same
about the count. Hello, ladies!

831
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,117
Trying to kill me, you troglodyte?

832
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:03,907
You dickhead! What have you done?

833
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:06,578
You served 8 euro sparkling wine!

834
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,368
You think this is
your cousin's birthday party?

835
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,989
You piece of shit!

836
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:14,080
You piece of shit!

837
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,082
Bring out the Cristal now
to make good!

838
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:19,241
Go!

839
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:24,326
You piece of shit!

840
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,242
Where's the butler?

841
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:32,829
This love that's blasphemous.

842
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,659
Corrupt.

843
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,576
Inert, haughty,

844
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:40,246
polyphonic, elegiac, diaconal,
postulatory.

845
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,869
In essence, an ineligible love.

846
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:46,162
She blushes and says:

847
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:50,990
"Forgive me, I didn't know
you loved me so much."

848
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:54,954
"My ignorance is obscene."

849
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,536
He looks at her, reassuringly,
and says:

850
01:24:57,708 --> 01:25:00,908
"Let me defend our love."

851
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,875
How's that for the start
of the second act?

852
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,572
You've written a pile of shit.

853
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:12,082
Are you stupid?
You're distracting my artist.

854
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,749
Dad, we're having fun.

855
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:17,030
- Alfio fell down.
- Alfio, I'll deal with you later.

856
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,365
Carmelina, come and do some work.

857
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,373
Mum, I want to play here.

858
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:24,749
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll sort it out.

859
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:28,206
- I'm not coming, I'm staying here.
- You don't mean that.

860
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:30,662
Europe's greatest gallery owners
are outside.

861
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:34,744
If you show them what you can do
then ours will be a happy family.

862
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:37,749
But I'm already happy,
I want to be a vet one day.

863
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,582
Get to bed, you two!

864
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:42,991
My kids are going to bed,
it's late for them.

865
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:44,873
- Come.
- I'll go to bed too.

866
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:46,831
I'm a kid too.

867
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,116
That girl was crying.

868
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:18,622
Nonsense!
That girl earns millions!

869
01:29:19,166 --> 01:29:20,909
Excuse me a moment.

870
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:25,873
Hi, Stefano.

871
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,703
Hi.

872
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:30,915
- The catering's gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.

873
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,122
Steeply downhill!

874
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,990
Do you have the case with you?

875
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,572
- I always do.
- You up for it?

876
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:50,616
Anything's better than staying here.

877
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,827
See that?

878
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,989
Stefano has the keys to Rome's
most beautiful buildings.

879
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,706
Is he a porter?

880
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:12,999
No, he's not a porter.

881
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,744
He's friends with princesses.

882
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:21,238
Are you ready?

883
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:23,953
Come with me.

884
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:25,623
I don't have it.

885
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:28,956
I told you I don't have it,
so why keep insisting?

886
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:48,664
Stefano...

887
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:39,204
Good evening, Princesses.

888
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:41,490
Good evening.

889
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:19,407
You look like an old child.

890
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:26,406
How come you have all these keys?

891
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,659
Because...

892
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,455
I'm a trustworthy person.

893
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:53,409
You see? It looked huge,
but it's tiny.

894
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,498
Stay still, I'll take a photo of you.
Don't move.

895
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,621
That's no good.
Laugh.

896
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,617
Got it?

897
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:11,199
Yes, that's good.

898
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,988
Many people think that a funeral

899
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:23,949
is a fortuitous event,
without any rules.

900
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:26,248
That's not true.

901
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:30,618
A funeral is a high-society event
<i>par excellence.</i>

902
01:37:32,166 --> 01:37:35,580
You must never forget
that at a funeral

903
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,662
you are appearing on stage.

904
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:44,582
Nice.

905
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:47,282
Nice, but try the other one.

906
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:54,202
You must patiently wait
for the relatives to disperse.

907
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:59,787
Once you are sure
that all the guests are seated...

908
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:03,622
only at that point, may you
offer your condolences to the family.

909
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,623
In this way, everyone will see you.

910
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,913
You take the mourner's hands,

911
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:15,030
and rest yours on their arms.

912
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:19,500
You whisper something to them,
a comforting phrase,

913
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:21,740
said with authority.

914
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:24,287
For example:

915
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:29,199
"In the days to come,
when you feel the void,"

916
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,622
"I want you to know
that you can always count on me."

917
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:38,075
The public will ask...

918
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,832
"What's Jep Gambardella saying?"

919
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:58,080
This is definitely the right dress.

920
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:07,913
You're allowed to retire
to a corner by yourself,

921
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,748
as if contemplating your sorrow.

922
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:17,908
However, another matter
must be approached with shrewdness.

923
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:25,457
The chosen place needs to be isolated
but clearly visible to the public.

924
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:32,579
Besides, a performance is good
when it is devoid of any superfluity.

925
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:41,038
So, the fundamental rule:
one must never cry at a funeral.

926
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:45,366
You must never steal the show
from the family's sorrow.

927
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:48,623
That is forbidden.

928
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,539
Because it is immoral.

929
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,784
Viola.

930
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:55,162
In the days to come,
when you feel the void,

931
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,823
you can always count on me.

932
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:53,284
Now I ask Andrea's friends

933
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,325
to come forward,

934
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:59,657
so that the coffin
may be carried outside.

935
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,116
Your back!

936
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,823
It was nice not making love.

937
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,656
It was nice loving each other.

938
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:25,239
I'd forgotten what loving someone
was about, I'd forgotten that.

939
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:34,488
I spend all my money to cure myself.

940
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,913
Your breakfast.

941
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:55,206
Come on, get up, today I'm taking you
to see a sea monster.

942
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,540
Your breakfast.

943
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:22,907
Five more minutes.

944
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,122
Can you see the sea?

945
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:40,951
Where?

946
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:42,873
On the ceiling.

947
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,324
Yes, I can see it.

948
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:56,540
Who's going to look after you now?

949
01:48:11,541 --> 01:48:13,615
I'm sorry about your daughter.

950
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:15,581
My condolences.

951
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:57,956
I spent all my summers

952
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:00,697
making plans for September.

953
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:02,534
Not any longer.

954
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:08,326
Now I spend my summers
remembering the good intentions

955
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:10,872
which vanished.

956
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:15,493
In part because of laziness,
in part because of carelessness.

957
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:21,784
What's wrong with feeling nostalgic?

958
01:49:23,416 --> 01:49:28,122
It's the only distraction left for
those who've no faith in the future!

959
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:34,033
Without rain...

960
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,490
August is coming to an end

961
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:38,997
and September isn't arriving.

962
01:49:40,458 --> 01:49:42,864
And I'm so ordinary!

963
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,657
But there's no need to worry.

964
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,451
It's all right, it's okay.

965
01:49:57,375 --> 01:49:58,832
Bravo!

966
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:16,082
Thank you.

967
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,076
Did you like the show?

968
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:24,035
People clapped, aren't you happy?

969
01:50:24,208 --> 01:50:26,247
No, I'm not happy.

970
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:31,326
Why'd you stop?
Take me home.

971
01:50:32,041 --> 01:50:34,708
Get out, I'm not taking you.

972
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,949
You're a shithead like all the others.

973
01:50:38,125 --> 01:50:40,992
Actually, you're worse
because you're good.

974
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:56,707
Romano...

975
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:00,123
come here.

976
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:10,238
Sit down.

977
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,158
Touch me.

978
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:34,572
In between my legs...

979
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:15,243
Goodness, look at all the seagulls!

980
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:18,413
Okay, shall we go?

981
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,364
What are you doing here?

982
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:12,368
Arturo!

983
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:14,374
Why are you here?

984
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:18,162
Don't you see?
I'm rehearsing my magic show.

985
01:53:18,416 --> 01:53:22,624
This is tomorrow's special number:
the vanishing giraffe.

986
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:25,240
You can make this giraffe vanish?

987
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:28,457
Of course I can make
the giraffe vanish!

988
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:32,532
Then make me vanish too.

989
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:40,122
Jep, do you think that if I could
really make people vanish

990
01:53:40,541 --> 01:53:44,535
I'd still be here at my age
playing these silly games?

991
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:47,451
It's just a trick.

992
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:53,581
It's just a trick!

993
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:59,156
It's just a trick!

994
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:05,282
Romano, how did it go?

995
01:54:05,583 --> 01:54:07,491
Well, they clapped.

996
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:09,706
I'm glad.

997
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:12,868
- So why are you so sad?
- I'm not sad.

998
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:14,659
What's with the giraffe?

999
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:17,660
For a magic show.
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

1000
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,865
I'm not doing the show tomorrow.

1001
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:22,581
Why not? You said it went well.

1002
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:27,657
I'm leaving, I'm going back
to my hometown, for good.

1003
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,449
I won't even pack up my things,
I'll leave it all.

1004
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:37,288
I've lived in this city
for 40 years.

1005
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:40,454
And in the end I thought...

1006
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:44,743
the only person
who deserved a goodbye

1007
01:54:45,208 --> 01:54:47,116
was you.

1008
01:54:49,166 --> 01:54:51,205
So you're leaving?

1009
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:56,789
Romano... why are you leaving?

1010
01:54:57,166 --> 01:54:59,537
Rome has really disappointed me.

1011
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:07,040
Bye, Jep.

1012
01:55:27,416 --> 01:55:29,159
See?

1013
01:55:58,375 --> 01:56:01,409
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. I know you're busy.

1014
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:03,414
I need to ask you something.

1015
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:05,873
Go ahead.

1016
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:12,448
Why did Elisa leave me?

1017
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:17,332
I don't know.

1018
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:21,577
Didn't she say anything about it
in her diary?

1019
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:24,364
No, I don't think so.

1020
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:31,369
Would you be offended
if I asked to read it?

1021
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:34,250
No, I wouldn't.

1022
01:56:34,875 --> 01:56:37,281
In fact, I'd understand.

1023
01:56:39,083 --> 01:56:41,489
But I'm afraid I can't let you read it.

1024
01:56:41,708 --> 01:56:42,739
Why not?

1025
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:46,576
Because a few days after the funeral,
I threw it away.

1026
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:54,496
May I introduce you to my girlfriend?

1027
01:56:56,083 --> 01:56:58,489
Hello, my name's Polina.

1028
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:04,030
Like Polina in "The Gambler"
by Dostoyevsky.

1029
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:12,747
What are you doing tonight?

1030
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,075
Nothing.

1031
01:57:16,666 --> 01:57:18,657
Polina's going to finish ironing...

1032
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:21,906
then we'll drink a glass of red wine.

1033
01:57:22,666 --> 01:57:26,364
We'll watch some television
and go to bed.

1034
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:28,906
What about you?

1035
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:35,618
I'll have a lot of drinks, but not
so many as to become unruly.

1036
01:57:36,083 --> 01:57:37,540
And then...

1037
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:41,247
when you'll be getting up

1038
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,204
I'll be going to bed.

1039
01:57:50,833 --> 01:57:54,081
What lovely people you are!

1040
01:58:04,625 --> 01:58:07,113
I love doing the train!

1041
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:11,906
I'll screw you.

1042
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,490
"Who am I?"

1043
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:22,366
That's how
one of Breton's novels began.

1044
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:26,456
And of course in the book
there's no reply.

1045
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,871
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?

1046
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:31,624
She donated everything
to the church.

1047
01:58:32,583 --> 01:58:37,205
She works in the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.

1048
01:58:37,416 --> 01:58:42,454
The trains at our parties
are the best ones in Rome!

1049
01:58:43,208 --> 01:58:45,247
- You think so?
- I do.

1050
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:50,406
They're the best because
they go nowhere.

1051
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:04,374
- Well?
- It's wonderful, thank you.

1052
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:07,202
Come on, it's all gone.

1053
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:10,415
Tell me why you left me, please.

1054
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:12,989
I want an explanation, please!

1055
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:16,991
Go away!
Get out! Get out!

1056
01:59:42,916 --> 01:59:44,825
You see all these people?

1057
01:59:45,958 --> 01:59:47,701
They can't do anything.

1058
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,242
But I know how to do something.

1059
01:59:51,833 --> 01:59:53,990
We know how to do something.

1060
01:59:56,708 --> 01:59:58,332
How sweet!

1061
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:26,494
- Who's that, your mother?
- Who?

1062
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:29,037
Yes... that's my mother...

1063
02:01:01,083 --> 02:01:02,624
So...

1064
02:01:03,625 --> 02:01:04,739
So...

1065
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:14,948
- So...
- So...

1066
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,123
So...

1067
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,323
So...

1068
02:01:43,833 --> 02:01:45,539
So...

1069
02:01:51,833 --> 02:01:56,076
They've been asking me for years
why I don't write another novel.

1070
02:01:57,333 --> 02:01:59,739
But look at these people.

1071
02:02:00,416 --> 02:02:02,241
This wildlife!

1072
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:06,831
This is my life
and it's nothing.

1073
02:02:10,291 --> 02:02:12,863
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but he failed,

1074
02:02:13,041 --> 02:02:14,582
so how could I?

1075
02:02:22,541 --> 02:02:25,208
It's good.
Thanks, rascal.

1076
02:02:47,291 --> 02:02:49,910
- Ron Sweet.
- Hello, I'm Gambardella.

1077
02:02:50,083 --> 02:02:51,742
Sorry I'm late.

1078
02:02:51,916 --> 02:02:55,910
We've been finalising the details
for tonight's opening.

1079
02:02:56,083 --> 02:02:58,655
- It's a pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

1080
02:02:58,833 --> 02:03:00,457
- Come in.
- Thanks.

1081
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:02,615
What inspired this exhibition?

1082
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:06,832
It wasn't my idea
to do this photo exhibition.

1083
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:09,822
It was my father's idea.

1084
02:03:10,333 --> 02:03:13,747
When I was born, he starting taking
photos of me, every day.

1085
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:15,831
One photo per day.

1086
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:19,249
He never forgot, not even once.

1087
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:23,618
From the age of 14 upwards,
I continued.

1088
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:27,622
I photographed myself every day.

1089
02:03:31,958 --> 02:03:33,368
Go ahead.

1090
02:05:54,041 --> 02:05:57,123
I love hot-air balloons.

1091
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,124
Good God,
did we really have to invite her?

1092
02:06:03,833 --> 02:06:07,282
Mum, she's my mother-in-law.

1093
02:06:24,125 --> 02:06:28,865
She resembles
a wonderful primitive animal.

1094
02:06:31,541 --> 02:06:34,623
A primitive animal
with infinite patrimonial assets.

1095
02:06:34,791 --> 02:06:37,198
Where are the meatballs?

1096
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,409
Stop, don't!

1097
02:06:55,583 --> 02:06:57,574
That mozzarella's blue.

1098
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,122
You're an asshole.

1099
02:07:00,291 --> 02:07:02,034
Such a fool...

1100
02:07:02,916 --> 02:07:05,666
Tell me something,
who is that cardinal?

1101
02:07:05,916 --> 02:07:08,287
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?

1102
02:07:08,458 --> 02:07:12,535
- The one in line to be...
- Exactly. The papal throne awaits him.

1103
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:15,197
I met him
at Giada Ricci's carnival party.

1104
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:18,954
Rumour has it that he used to be
Europe's best exorcist.

1105
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:20,908
- Pulling my leg again?
- No.

1106
02:07:21,291 --> 02:07:23,614
I never joke about the devil.

1107
02:07:23,791 --> 02:07:27,157
Do you know I'm very, very bored?

1108
02:07:28,666 --> 02:07:31,333
We're having a great, great time.

1109
02:07:50,291 --> 02:07:53,159
Cardinal,
when will The Saint arrive in Rome?

1110
02:07:53,333 --> 02:07:56,498
On Thursday,
but please don't call her The Saint.

1111
02:07:56,708 --> 02:08:00,951
She is a Saint but not technically.

1112
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:04,873
She'll become one.
There's no doubt about it.

1113
02:08:05,416 --> 02:08:07,621
The Congregation will decide.

1114
02:08:11,666 --> 02:08:15,957
First soak the mushrooms
in warm water.

1115
02:08:16,125 --> 02:08:18,910
Then you cut up the duck.

1116
02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:20,833
Remove the skin

1117
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,824
and put it in a pan
with one spoon of oil.

1118
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,203
Cook it on a high flame
for 15 minutes.

1119
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:32,702
At that point...

1120
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:35,707
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.

1121
02:08:35,916 --> 02:08:38,488
We met at Giada Ricci's party.

1122
02:08:38,625 --> 02:08:40,331
I was dressed as an escort.

1123
02:08:40,541 --> 02:08:43,113
Come, they're starting to serve lunch.

1124
02:08:43,333 --> 02:08:46,782
I'd like you meet my writer friend,
Jep Gambardella.

1125
02:08:47,791 --> 02:08:49,913
A writer!

1126
02:08:50,291 --> 02:08:52,531
This country needs writers.

1127
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:54,996
I thought it needed more priests.

1128
02:08:55,833 --> 02:08:57,374
That too...

1129
02:08:57,541 --> 02:08:59,781
The two are not dissimilar...

1130
02:08:59,958 --> 02:09:02,032
they both require a vocation.

1131
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,323
Help.

1132
02:09:03,541 --> 02:09:06,457
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.

1133
02:09:06,708 --> 02:09:08,699
Well, for some time now...

1134
02:09:13,625 --> 02:09:16,457
from a spiritual point of view...

1135
02:09:18,125 --> 02:09:20,080
Skunk hunt?

1136
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:22,282
Of course, I'll lead the way!

1137
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:25,332
I know the Tebaldi grounds well.

1138
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:35,915
Jep Gambardella, the king
of socialites! You're losing it.

1139
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:40,664
I've been losing it for 40 years.
It's a steady decline.

1140
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:53,323
This is it, we're here!

1141
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:58,617
Come this way!

1142
02:10:00,166 --> 02:10:02,406
This way, come!

1143
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:07,159
Here!

1144
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:10,201
Skunk hunting, what a shitty idea.

1145
02:10:10,375 --> 02:10:13,456
Lello, do skunks really stink?

1146
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:15,498
How should I know?

1147
02:10:19,416 --> 02:10:22,782
- How much prosecco did you drink?
- 117 glasses.

1148
02:10:28,541 --> 02:10:31,243
Dickhead,
what would you do without me?

1149
02:10:32,083 --> 02:10:34,785
We're here, come!

1150
02:10:35,666 --> 02:10:37,657
There are tons of skunks here.

1151
02:10:37,833 --> 02:10:39,658
Hic sunt puteolae.

1152
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:42,618
Come, come see the skunks.

1153
02:10:43,333 --> 02:10:46,332
Won't you come see the skunks?

1154
02:10:53,208 --> 02:10:55,330
<i>I will steal you...</i>

1155
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,207
<i>From everyone who keeps you far</i>

1156
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:04,157
<i>From me</i>

1157
02:11:04,833 --> 02:11:06,955
<i>I will take you</i>

1158
02:11:07,666 --> 02:11:11,364
<i>With my boat toward lands unknown</i>

1159
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,204
<i>To you</i>

1160
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:19,075
<i>You will get to know</i>

1161
02:11:19,541 --> 02:11:23,665
<i>The freedom to love
that you were never given</i>

1162
02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:28,454
<i>I will steal you</i>

1163
02:11:28,625 --> 02:11:32,239
<i>You'll see, I will manage</i>

1164
02:11:33,625 --> 02:11:37,204
<i>My love</i>

1165
02:11:39,041 --> 02:11:44,079
<i>If you so desire</i>

1166
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:51,365
Tell me something, Stefania.

1167
02:11:51,583 --> 02:11:54,949
Have we ever slept with each other?

1168
02:11:55,916 --> 02:11:57,955
Of course not!

1169
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:05,074
That's an awfully big mistake!

1170
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:07,703
We must make amends, immediately.

1171
02:12:08,375 --> 02:12:09,868
Idiot.

1172
02:12:12,208 --> 02:12:13,784
Thank goodness.

1173
02:12:13,958 --> 02:12:16,790
We still have something nice
to do together.

1174
02:12:19,458 --> 02:12:22,457
The future is marvellous, Stefania.

1175
02:12:58,291 --> 02:13:03,577
To be honest, Catellani hasn't had
many brushed fabrics in recent years.

1176
02:13:03,791 --> 02:13:08,164
In my opinion, Rebecchi's still
the best tailor in Rome.

1177
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:13,784
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man.

1178
02:13:13,958 --> 02:13:18,782
One who, while you play the artist
and have fun with your friends,

1179
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,406
keeps this country going.

1180
02:13:21,583 --> 02:13:24,202
I keep this country going,

1181
02:13:24,416 --> 02:13:26,953
but many people
haven't understood that yet.

1182
02:13:30,041 --> 02:13:34,782
Imagine that, Dadina,
Giulio Moneta was my neighbour.

1183
02:13:34,958 --> 02:13:40,161
One of the world's 10 most wanted men
and I didn't know.

1184
02:13:40,791 --> 02:13:42,285
Heard from Romano?

1185
02:13:42,458 --> 02:13:45,208
He vanished, understandably so.

1186
02:13:45,375 --> 02:13:47,497
He cut off ties with everyone.

1187
02:13:51,041 --> 02:13:54,123
You've changed,
you're always thinking.

1188
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:58,539
But not about the usual bullshit
that we laugh over.

1189
02:14:01,041 --> 02:14:03,032
Maybe I should do what Romano did.

1190
02:14:04,208 --> 02:14:06,614
I'm not fit for this life or this city.

1191
02:14:06,791 --> 02:14:11,201
Nobody's fit for anything, dammit.
Take it from the queen of misfits.

1192
02:14:12,583 --> 02:14:15,368
Everything around me is dying.

1193
02:14:16,208 --> 02:14:19,373
People who are younger than me,
things...

1194
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,874
All before my eyes and I...

1195
02:14:22,083 --> 02:14:25,497
And you're suffering.
And you don't understand.

1196
02:14:33,375 --> 02:14:35,164
How's the soup, Little Jep?

1197
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,159
The soup's good.

1198
02:14:42,708 --> 02:14:46,702
Why did you call me Little Jep?
No one's called me that for centuries.

1199
02:14:46,875 --> 02:14:48,783
Because a friend,
every now and again,

1200
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,077
needs to make their friend
feel like they did as a child.

1201
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,832
How can I make you feel
like a little girl?

1202
02:14:58,041 --> 02:15:00,708
You don't need to,
I feel like a little girl every day!

1203
02:15:00,916 --> 02:15:04,661
I've seen the world from
that viewpoint for 60 years.

1204
02:15:10,208 --> 02:15:13,906
As soon as you finish your soup
I'll give you some killer news.

1205
02:15:14,083 --> 02:15:15,826
Tell me, I'm dying to know.

1206
02:15:16,041 --> 02:15:20,165
You know Sister Maria, the missionary,
the one they call The Saint?

1207
02:15:20,291 --> 02:15:24,534
Yes, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honour.

1208
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:28,074
Exactly. In all her life,
she's only given three interviews.

1209
02:15:28,250 --> 02:15:31,746
- Yours will be memorable.
- Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!

1210
02:15:31,916 --> 02:15:33,706
This is different.

1211
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:37,164
She studied in Italy
and speaks Italian.

1212
02:15:37,416 --> 02:15:39,325
She read your book and loved it.

1213
02:15:39,791 --> 02:15:43,833
She wants to meet you so I organised
a dinner party at your house tomorrow.

1214
02:15:44,208 --> 02:15:46,448
- Did I do well?
- You did very well.

1215
02:15:46,625 --> 02:15:49,990
Get your interview with
that big-headed Bracco done today

1216
02:15:50,166 --> 02:15:53,082
and tomorrow
we'll focus on The Saint.

1217
02:15:54,083 --> 02:15:56,489
Well well, Pappardella!

1218
02:15:56,666 --> 02:15:58,539
It's Gambardella...

1219
02:15:58,708 --> 02:16:01,624
As I always say to my clients:

1220
02:16:01,833 --> 02:16:04,405
Beautiful bodies don't last,
they're apparitions.

1221
02:16:04,583 --> 02:16:07,913
- Big words, Bracco.
- Truthful words.

1222
02:16:08,083 --> 02:16:12,623
I have a certain knowhow
that makes the human circus go round.

1223
02:16:12,833 --> 02:16:14,290
Which is?

1224
02:16:19,333 --> 02:16:21,455
Access to beauty.

1225
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,076
One.

1226
02:17:23,875 --> 02:17:26,246
- How are you?
- Fine.

1227
02:17:26,416 --> 02:17:29,284
Just got back from India,
I had amazing dysentery.

1228
02:17:29,958 --> 02:17:33,288
Come to my divorce party, I'll have
burlesque dancers on elephants.

1229
02:17:33,458 --> 02:17:36,077
Of course.
What present would you like?

1230
02:17:36,250 --> 02:17:39,746
One thing, peace in the Middle East.

1231
02:17:39,916 --> 02:17:41,243
- I'll try.
- Two.

1232
02:17:41,416 --> 02:17:42,697
700 euros.

1233
02:17:43,458 --> 02:17:44,915
Here you go.

1234
02:17:45,375 --> 02:17:46,489
Yes, darling.

1235
02:17:46,916 --> 02:17:48,907
Perhaps...

1236
02:17:49,083 --> 02:17:51,240
I was thinking, my mouth...

1237
02:17:52,125 --> 02:17:55,206
I'm scared, I've never done it before,
professor.

1238
02:17:55,375 --> 02:17:59,416
Don't call me professor.
Call me "my friend" or "my love."

1239
02:17:59,875 --> 02:18:02,328
We all need love.

1240
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:05,409
What star sign are you,
deeply intense lady?

1241
02:18:06,125 --> 02:18:08,163
- Aquarius.
- I knew it.

1242
02:18:08,333 --> 02:18:10,039
Want to go back 30 years

1243
02:18:10,208 --> 02:18:13,408
to when it rained in August?
Done.

1244
02:18:13,583 --> 02:18:16,202
- 700.
- Three.

1245
02:18:16,375 --> 02:18:18,034
Baby doll.

1246
02:18:18,458 --> 02:18:21,374
- Hi.
- My baby doll.

1247
02:18:21,541 --> 02:18:23,912
My boyfriend says
I don't really need it...

1248
02:18:24,083 --> 02:18:26,122
We all need it.

1249
02:18:26,333 --> 02:18:28,869
Your boyfriend is blinded by love

1250
02:18:29,041 --> 02:18:32,289
and he can't see things as they are,
that's why.

1251
02:18:32,458 --> 02:18:34,082
That's 700.

1252
02:18:34,416 --> 02:18:35,910
- How's your mum?
- Fine.

1253
02:18:37,458 --> 02:18:39,034
- Five.
- That's 700.

1254
02:18:39,208 --> 02:18:42,538
You're plumper, darling.
You're always in my heart.

1255
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:44,326
- That's 700.
- Eight.

1256
02:18:47,375 --> 02:18:49,781
Hello, honey.
As handsome as ever.

1257
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,955
- You're my pride and joy.
- Thanks.

1258
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:55,535
Eleven.

1259
02:19:03,083 --> 02:19:07,658
- You've been to see Casagrande.
- I don't know who that is!

1260
02:19:07,833 --> 02:19:09,243
You betrayed me.

1261
02:19:09,416 --> 02:19:12,581
We're undertaking a journey,
and you've interrupted it.

1262
02:19:21,166 --> 02:19:23,324
This is the last time.

1263
02:19:27,583 --> 02:19:28,958
Go, go.

1264
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:30,749
Bye then.

1265
02:19:32,625 --> 02:19:34,450
Full price.

1266
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,323
- Twelve.
- That's 1,200 euros.

1267
02:19:50,291 --> 02:19:53,954
Professor,
I'm here for my hyperhidrosis.

1268
02:19:54,333 --> 02:19:56,537
Where's this undesired perspiration?

1269
02:19:57,166 --> 02:19:58,909
On my hands.

1270
02:20:03,250 --> 02:20:06,498
- Pray for me, sister.
- You don't need my prayers.

1271
02:20:06,666 --> 02:20:11,206
You don't know how much of my income
I must surrender to the tax man.

1272
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,493
Go on, sister.

1273
02:20:21,583 --> 02:20:23,538
That'll be 700, sister.

1274
02:22:35,083 --> 02:22:38,864
Tomorrow I'll have the honour
of dining with her.

1275
02:22:39,041 --> 02:22:41,494
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.

1276
02:22:41,833 --> 02:22:43,327
No, at Jep Gambardella's.

1277
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:47,331
You see, the Pope even invited

1278
02:22:47,541 --> 02:22:50,540
the enclosed nuns.

1279
02:24:07,833 --> 02:24:09,576
Sisters...

1280
02:24:12,541 --> 02:24:14,117
Sisters...

1281
02:24:16,833 --> 02:24:18,824
Hold on...

1282
02:24:20,291 --> 02:24:21,406
Oh God!

1283
02:24:25,625 --> 02:24:27,367
Sisters, sisters, sisters!

1284
02:24:29,083 --> 02:24:31,157
Sisters, sisters...
Yes, perfect!

1285
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:33,207
Thanks... great.

1286
02:24:33,416 --> 02:24:35,787
Ah, Red Cross nurses!
So fit!

1287
02:24:35,958 --> 02:24:38,826
Okay, great...
What handsome young men!

1288
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:40,875
Great!

1289
02:24:41,416 --> 02:24:42,791
Let's go!

1290
02:24:53,833 --> 02:24:55,160
What'll we eat?

1291
02:24:55,375 --> 02:24:59,073
- Carbonara and veal roulade.
- A light meal...

1292
02:24:59,166 --> 02:25:01,952
The Saint weighs 11 kilos.

1293
02:25:03,291 --> 02:25:04,666
If she's vegetarian?

1294
02:25:04,833 --> 02:25:08,993
There's always AhÃ¨'s endive quiche.
That's vegetarian.

1295
02:25:09,208 --> 02:25:11,412
Hello? Yes.

1296
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:17,241
Now you tell me?
How'll I fucking find the Odescalchis?

1297
02:25:17,416 --> 02:25:20,166
- What's wrong?
- The Saint's assistant called me.

1298
02:25:20,333 --> 02:25:24,161
The Saint would like
Count Odescalchi to come too,

1299
02:25:24,333 --> 02:25:26,739
he treated her like family
when she was here.

1300
02:25:26,916 --> 02:25:29,702
- Do you know him?
- Of course, but he's not in Rome.

1301
02:25:29,875 --> 02:25:34,532
All the nobles are in London,
at Philip's great-niece's wedding.

1302
02:25:35,208 --> 02:25:39,415
Hold on...
Let's call the Colonnas from Reggio.

1303
02:25:39,708 --> 02:25:42,161
The nobles for hire? They're dead.

1304
02:25:42,333 --> 02:25:45,912
- Nonsense, they're immortal.
- But they're not the Odescalchis.

1305
02:25:46,083 --> 02:25:50,077
The Saint won't even notice,
70 years have gone by!

1306
02:25:50,375 --> 02:25:53,954
The Colonnas are true aristocrats,
and aristocrats all look the same.

1307
02:25:54,125 --> 02:25:55,618
True...

1308
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:59,199
<i>This piece of furniture
looks great..</i>

1309
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:03,244
<i>I'd never have thought
of putting it in the bathroom.</i>

1310
02:26:03,416 --> 02:26:06,830
<i>It looks great,
like a new bathroom!</i>

1311
02:26:07,166 --> 02:26:09,537
<i>Well done, Andrea!</i>

1312
02:26:10,833 --> 02:26:13,204
Count Colonna speaking.

1313
02:26:13,625 --> 02:26:15,996
Yes, we are available.

1314
02:26:17,083 --> 02:26:18,873
For tonight...

1315
02:26:19,041 --> 02:26:23,165
Short notice would entail
a small surcharge.

1316
02:26:24,333 --> 02:26:28,375
Our rate is 250 euros per person
for the evening.

1317
02:26:28,541 --> 02:26:32,951
Plus the cost of the car hire.

1318
02:26:33,666 --> 02:26:36,748
No, I'm not sure...

1319
02:26:38,333 --> 02:26:42,825
This would be somewhat
humiliating for us...

1320
02:26:43,666 --> 02:26:47,364
We are willing to be hired...

1321
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:50,206
as the Colonnas from Reggio.

1322
02:26:51,041 --> 02:26:55,202
But as for pretending to be
the Odescalchis...

1323
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:57,243
I don't know...

1324
02:26:58,375 --> 02:27:03,281
We were at war for two centuries.
I feel it's immoral.

1325
02:27:04,666 --> 02:27:07,997
Let me talk it over with my wife
Elisabetta.

1326
02:27:09,791 --> 02:27:12,659
All right, ma'am.

1327
02:27:12,833 --> 02:27:16,578
For this time, we'll go along with it.

1328
02:27:17,291 --> 02:27:20,373
But we would appreciate it

1329
02:27:20,541 --> 02:27:24,867
if you would supplement
the contribution.

1330
02:27:25,083 --> 02:27:29,623
Cut at least twelve pieces of rabbit!

1331
02:27:30,208 --> 02:27:33,574
Set aside the kidneys, liver, head...

1332
02:27:33,916 --> 02:27:35,872
Gently brown it.

1333
02:27:36,791 --> 02:27:39,410
Don't forget thyme,
laurel leaves, rosemary...

1334
02:27:39,583 --> 02:27:44,039
Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
pine nuts.

1335
02:27:44,916 --> 02:27:47,915
And after an hour,
you have Ligurian-style rabbit!

1336
02:27:48,916 --> 02:27:51,121
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?

1337
02:27:51,291 --> 02:27:55,203
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel
at the Spanish Steps.

1338
02:27:56,208 --> 02:27:59,040
To be honest, Sister Maria
finds it uncomfortable.

1339
02:27:59,291 --> 02:28:01,662
Never heard the Hassler
described as uncomfortable!

1340
02:28:02,208 --> 02:28:07,198
It's very comfortable but Sister Maria
isn't used to sleeping in a bed.

1341
02:28:07,833 --> 02:28:11,163
She sleeps on the floor,
in a cardboard bed.

1342
02:28:11,375 --> 02:28:13,330
Do you have any visits planned?

1343
02:28:13,583 --> 02:28:17,625
Sister Maria will climb St John's
Basilica's Scala Sancta on her knees.

1344
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:20,666
- Have you?
- I'd have liked to, but...

1345
02:28:20,875 --> 02:28:23,790
I have a bad knee...

1346
02:28:24,041 --> 02:28:26,364
Orthopaedic problems
are unimportant,

1347
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:31,448
compared to the plenary indulgence
granted by the Scala Sancta.

1348
02:28:31,666 --> 02:28:33,160
That's true!

1349
02:28:33,333 --> 02:28:36,284
Another speciality
of mine is lamb with...

1350
02:28:36,541 --> 02:28:39,327
Does Sister Maria still help
the sick?

1351
02:28:39,583 --> 02:28:42,783
22 hours a day, every day.

1352
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:46,449
She washes them, feeds them...
You ought to see her.

1353
02:28:46,666 --> 02:28:49,238
Despite her age,
she doesn't walk, she runs.

1354
02:28:49,416 --> 02:28:50,992
She's inexhaustible!

1355
02:28:51,166 --> 02:28:55,623
Now she's tired, but that's because
she's not with her patients.

1356
02:28:55,833 --> 02:28:57,409
How old is she?

1357
02:28:57,666 --> 02:28:59,456
She'll be 104 in October.

1358
02:28:59,666 --> 02:29:01,954
- That's impressive.
- I thought she was older!

1359
02:29:02,125 --> 02:29:06,996
Longevity too, like all things,
is not accidental.

1360
02:29:07,208 --> 02:29:10,124
About Sister Maria's interview
with Jep...

1361
02:29:10,375 --> 02:29:11,999
Her interview?

1362
02:29:12,625 --> 02:29:15,031
There must be a mix-up...

1363
02:29:15,375 --> 02:29:18,125
Sister Maria hasn't given
any interviews since 1971,

1364
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:21,077
after the reason
for her mission in Chad,

1365
02:29:21,250 --> 02:29:23,868
was misunderstood by some.

1366
02:29:24,416 --> 02:29:27,533
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work...

1367
02:29:27,708 --> 02:29:30,079
You told me she enjoyed
"The Human Apparatus."

1368
02:29:30,291 --> 02:29:33,491
She found it beautiful and fierce.

1369
02:29:33,708 --> 02:29:35,616
Like the world of men.

1370
02:29:35,791 --> 02:29:38,541
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,

1371
02:29:38,708 --> 02:29:40,533
Sister Maria can review the text...

1372
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:43,914
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't insist.

1373
02:29:44,125 --> 02:29:47,538
I don't wish to raise any false hopes,

1374
02:29:47,708 --> 02:29:51,204
there's absolutely
no question of any interview.

1375
02:29:52,083 --> 02:29:54,287
Sorry, but why do you always answer?

1376
02:29:54,416 --> 02:29:56,574
Why not let Sister Maria talk?

1377
02:30:15,875 --> 02:30:18,162
Madam...

1378
02:30:21,041 --> 02:30:25,165
I took a vow of poverty.

1379
02:30:26,958 --> 02:30:31,533
And you can't talk about poverty...

1380
02:30:33,208 --> 02:30:34,951
you have to live it.

1381
02:30:46,541 --> 02:30:50,286
Such true and real words!
Powerful words!

1382
02:30:54,458 --> 02:30:56,615
Do you need anything, madam?

1383
02:30:57,250 --> 02:30:59,537
- She needs the bathroom.
- It's on the left.

1384
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:02,452
The change of diet
isn't good for her.

1385
02:31:02,666 --> 02:31:09,197
Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
40 grams of plant roots a day.

1386
02:31:09,458 --> 02:31:12,907
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,

1387
02:31:13,083 --> 02:31:16,449
I have some splendid
roots with lemon.

1388
02:31:16,708 --> 02:31:19,873
You clean the roots
by scraping them with a knife

1389
02:31:20,125 --> 02:31:23,574
and you cut them into small chunks...

1390
02:31:23,833 --> 02:31:27,116
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?

1391
02:31:27,375 --> 02:31:29,081
You were there too...

1392
02:31:30,791 --> 02:31:35,911
I felt the need to ask you
about matters close to my heart.

1393
02:31:36,125 --> 02:31:38,827
Matters regarding faith...

1394
02:31:39,041 --> 02:31:42,988
regarding the strength
of spirituality...

1395
02:31:43,375 --> 02:31:45,248
But then you got distracted.

1396
02:31:45,458 --> 02:31:47,034
You can ask me now.

1397
02:31:48,916 --> 02:31:52,081
- No, I don't see the point.
- Why?

1398
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:58,614
I'd be very disappointed to discover
that you have no answers.

1399
02:31:59,208 --> 02:32:01,661
I'm only saying it's a possibility...

1400
02:32:01,875 --> 02:32:03,913
I think that...

1401
02:32:10,291 --> 02:32:11,572
Never mind...

1402
02:32:16,666 --> 02:32:18,705
I apologise for earlier.

1403
02:32:18,875 --> 02:32:22,619
I'm afraid I was somewhat offensive.

1404
02:32:23,625 --> 02:32:27,204
There is one question
I really want to ask you.

1405
02:32:28,458 --> 02:32:31,125
Are the rumours about you true?

1406
02:32:32,125 --> 02:32:34,115
That you were a truly great...

1407
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:38,039
exorcist?

1408
02:33:12,625 --> 02:33:14,498
See you at the office.

1409
02:33:32,291 --> 02:33:34,200
Sister Maria...

1410
02:33:34,791 --> 02:33:36,249
Sister Maria!

1411
02:33:41,333 --> 02:33:43,206
Where's Sister Maria?

1412
02:33:44,708 --> 02:33:46,782
I thought she was with you.

1413
02:33:46,958 --> 02:33:51,118
- She was with you.
- Yes, but then she went to you.

1414
02:33:51,916 --> 02:33:54,535
We're going, thank you and goodbye.

1415
02:33:57,083 --> 02:33:58,659
Sister Maria!

1416
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:01,039
- Sister Maria!
- Sister Maria!

1417
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:04,956
- Have you seen her?
- She's not there.

1418
02:34:05,125 --> 02:34:06,998
Saint...

1419
02:34:11,666 --> 02:34:13,788
Sister Maria!

1420
02:34:17,958 --> 02:34:19,285
Saint...

1421
02:34:20,416 --> 02:34:21,661
Saint!

1422
02:34:21,833 --> 02:34:24,369
She's called Sister Maria.

1423
02:34:24,541 --> 02:34:26,165
Sister Maria...

1424
02:34:26,333 --> 02:34:29,201
Where has that bitch got to?

1425
02:34:31,166 --> 02:34:34,366
These 550 euros

1426
02:34:34,958 --> 02:34:37,625
have come at just the right time.

1427
02:34:38,958 --> 02:34:40,534
It was a lovely evening too.

1428
02:34:40,708 --> 02:34:45,698
Lovely evenings are others, Alceste.

1429
02:35:11,791 --> 02:35:13,581
Sister Maria!

1430
02:35:16,625 --> 02:35:18,615
Sister Maria!

1431
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,873
My goodness!

1432
02:35:58,291 --> 02:36:01,159
Come, Elisabetta, let's go to bed.

1433
02:36:01,375 --> 02:36:04,326
You go ahead, I'm going upstairs
for a moment.

1434
02:36:05,708 --> 02:36:07,747
Don't be late.

1435
02:36:19,666 --> 02:36:22,701
Countess,
we must put a stop to this.

1436
02:36:22,875 --> 02:36:26,158
I'll lose my job
if I let you in every night.

1437
02:36:30,666 --> 02:36:33,073
This isn't your home anymore.

1438
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:36,746
- It's a museum now.
- This will always be my home.

1439
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:47,451
<i>In this room, in 1930,</i>

1440
02:37:47,625 --> 02:37:51,074
<i>Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,</i>

1441
02:37:51,250 --> 02:37:53,537
<i>Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.</i>

1442
02:37:53,958 --> 02:37:57,075
<i>The princess died
after giving birth.</i>

1443
02:37:57,250 --> 02:38:00,201
<i>Young Elisabetta,
in these opulent rooms,</i>

1444
02:38:00,375 --> 02:38:03,160
<i>had a happy and carefree childhood.</i>

1445
02:38:03,333 --> 02:38:08,239
<i>But shortly after, the financial
hardship endured by Prince Erminio</i>

1446
02:38:08,916 --> 02:38:11,702
<i>forced him to sell the property.</i>

1447
02:38:48,833 --> 02:38:50,907
They're migrating west...

1448
02:38:51,083 --> 02:38:55,125
but now they are resting.

1449
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,624
Did you know

1450
02:39:11,708 --> 02:39:16,248
that I know the Christian names...

1451
02:39:16,708 --> 02:39:20,915
of all of these birds?

1452
02:39:28,708 --> 02:39:29,786
Why...

1453
02:39:31,708 --> 02:39:35,204
did you never write another book?

1454
02:39:41,416 --> 02:39:43,455
I was looking for the great beauty,

1455
02:39:45,750 --> 02:39:47,374
but...

1456
02:39:50,333 --> 02:39:51,827
I didn't find it.

1457
02:39:53,875 --> 02:39:55,581
Do you know...

1458
02:39:56,541 --> 02:39:58,035
why...

1459
02:39:58,791 --> 02:40:01,908
I only eat roots?

1460
02:40:07,333 --> 02:40:09,039
No, why?

1461
02:40:15,875 --> 02:40:20,082
Because roots are important.

1462
02:43:06,458 --> 02:43:10,203
Now there's something
I want to show you.

1463
02:44:11,625 --> 02:44:15,369
<i>This is how it always ends.
With death.</i>

1464
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:19,865
<i>But first there was life.</i>

1465
02:44:20,416 --> 02:44:24,328
<i>Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.</i>

1466
02:44:26,833 --> 02:44:31,871
<i>It is all settled beneath
the chitter chatter and the noise.</i>

1467
02:44:32,708 --> 02:44:36,074
<i>Silence and sentiment.</i>

1468
02:44:36,708 --> 02:44:40,074
<i>Emotion and fear.</i>

1469
02:44:41,083 --> 02:44:46,866
<i>The haggard, inconstant
splashes of beauty.</i>

1470
02:44:47,416 --> 02:44:52,489
<i>And then the wretched squalor
and miserable humanity.</i>

1471
02:44:53,833 --> 02:44:58,490
<i>All buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world.</i>

1472
02:45:03,791 --> 02:45:07,157
<i>Elsewhere,
there is what lies beyond.</i>

1473
02:45:08,583 --> 02:45:11,949
<i>I don't deal
with what lies beyond.</i>

1474
02:45:13,208 --> 02:45:14,867
<i>Therefore...</i>

1475
02:45:15,541 --> 02:45:18,291
<i>let this novel begin.</i>

1476
02:45:19,125 --> 02:45:20,914
<i>After all...</i>

1477
02:45:21,458 --> 02:45:23,829
<i>it's just a trick.</i>

1478
02:45:24,041 --> 02:45:25,914
<i>Yes,</i>

1479
02:45:26,416 --> 02:45:27,992
<i>it's just a trick.</i>

1480
02:45:32,833 --> 02:45:35,037
THE GREAT BEAUTY

1481
02:45:37,958 --> 02:45:40,364
to Peppe and Maurizio

1481
