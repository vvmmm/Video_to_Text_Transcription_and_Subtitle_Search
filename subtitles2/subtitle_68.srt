FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,002
{\an8}When sad hunches come true,

4
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,499
{\an8}there are signs that come beforehand.

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,415
NOTICE

6
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,922
{\an8}That cowardly bastard.

7
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,796
{\an8}The small anxieties
that I've been trying hard to ignore

8
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,513
{\an8}keep knocking on my door,

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,308
{\an8}telling me not to ignore them.

10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,605
Why are you staring at me like that?

11
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,026
Do you want to go out for dinner?
Or do you have something to say?

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,871
I have a favor to ask you.

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,245
Hello?

14
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,422
You've been ignoring my calls
for two days in a row.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,377
Are you busy?

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,130
Sorry.

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,760
What are you doing tomorrow?

18
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,604
Today.

19
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,232
Where are you right now?

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,730
How about a drink today?

21
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,267
Now?

22
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,605
Oh, you're busy?

23
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,980
Then we can meet tomorrow.

24
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,778
Chan-hyuk.

25
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,912
Why are you lowering your voice like that?

26
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,661
Spend the day with me tomorrow.

27
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,289
Dr. Yoonâ¦

28
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,376
didn't come back
from the seminar in New Zealand.

29
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,594
What do you mean?

30
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,971
He was supposed to be back yesterday,
but he still hasn't called me.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,300
And of course,
the clinic couldn't open today.

32
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,193
Mother.

33
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,034
He often used to disappear and come back.

34
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,366
I thought he got rid of that habit
when he got married

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,028
but looks like it came back.

36
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,622
I should find a doctor
who can work briefly at the clinic.

37
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,459
Do you and Father know whyâ¦

38
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,755
Dr. Yoon disappears and comes back?

39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,394
He's emotionally sensitive

40
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,678
and likes to be alone.

41
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,387
And he has a bit of
chronic depression too.

42
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,578
You and Father
knew about his orientation--

43
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,538
I told him to take antidepressants,
but he doesn't listen.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,370
Doctors are indifferent
to their own diseases.

45
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,093
He has no reason to take medication.

46
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,761
Because it's not a disease.

47
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,253
I looked it up.

48
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,092
Famous people graduate from marriage too.

49
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,891
They hold a graduation ceremony,
go on a graduation trip,

50
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,891
and have a graduation party too.

51
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,388
I'm not going to drink it.

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,443
I don't know what you looked up,

53
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,108
but I'm too tacky to have parties

54
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,987
and go on a trip
for graduating from marriage.

55
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,035
Are you sure your memories are back?

56
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,123
Sang-sik.

57
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,415
Do you know how manly you were?

58
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,129
Yes, those eyes.

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,682
It doesn't suit you at all.

60
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,715
Do you think I want to do this?

61
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,114
You can't even drink.

62
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,566
Wine isn't even strong.

63
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,992
Let's talk when the house
is taken care of.

64
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,793
Ms. Sook, I'm not finished.

65
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,174
What I'm saying isâ¦

66
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,094
No need to sell this house.
Put it under your name.

67
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,508
We decided to divide it.
That would make me feel comfortable.

68
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,980
Let's stop talking about it today.

69
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,490
I'm here to drink
some strong coffee you brew.

70
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,952
Is something going on?

71
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,919
I'm a bit far away,

72
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,086
in Sorokdo.

73
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,196
If you wanted to hide perfectly,
you shouldn't have come here.

74
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,638
You can't even look in the mirror, right?

75
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,762
You only know how to blabber
in the chat room.

76
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,637
You are always scared
if something feels a little off.

77
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,734
I'm not scared of it. I hate it.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't know
why you came all the way here.

79
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,792
I don't want to deal with you here.

80
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,092
Get out.

81
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,669
If you wanted to avoid this,

82
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,967
you should've minded your own business.

83
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,604
Someone else stole from me.
Why are you paying it back?

84
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,851
Weren't you hanging around me
because of money?

85
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,141
I was curious about
what kind of person you were.

86
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,056
But,

87
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,858
I stuck around because I pitied Eun-joo,
who is being tricked.

88
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,032
How do you know if she's being tricked
or pretending to be tricked?

89
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,532
Regardless of which one it is,

90
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,078
I know what it feels like to be unloved.

91
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,793
If you're never going to say the truth,

92
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,251
don't use someone else as a shield.

93
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,713
You're quite sentimental.

94
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,219
That's why you guys get hurt, break up,

95
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,473
get ripped off, waste your youth,

96
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,675
and live the lowest life possible.

97
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,777
Want me to buy you one more?

98
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,033
No, thanks.

99
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,994
Didn't have dinner yet, right?

100
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,328
I saw you leave work right away,
and I got worried.

101
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,963
Is the family matter still complicated?

102
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,495
Yes.

103
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,674
Very complicated.

104
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,422
There's something
I can finally help you with, right?

105
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,758
How are you so sharp-witted?

106
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,797
I've been living my life
needing to be sharp-witted.

107
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,430
No reaction? That was a sad confession.

108
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,768
Tell me.

109
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,352
I'll listen.

110
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,108
It's a bit cunning
since this favor uses authority.

111
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,781
According to you, Vice CEO,

112
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,315
humans sometimes need to be a coward

113
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,327
so their hearts won't explode.

114
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,618
It's philosophical,

115
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,503
but you interpreted it in a simple way.

116
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,874
Iâ¦

117
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,459
I can't go to work tomorrow, either.

118
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,264
But I was off at work too much these days.

119
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,222
It's a mess.

120
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,304
It was a mess.

121
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,642
Okay.

122
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,767
I may report it as you working away
for me tomorrow--

123
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,520
-Thank you.
-I said I "may."

124
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,977
Can you tell me
why you can't come to work?

125
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,987
I have to find someone.

126
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,358
Still ambiguous without any information.

127
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,485
All right.

128
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,288
Thank you so much.

129
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,000
Remember when I told you I broke up?

130
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,629
I told you that
this is comfortable for me.

131
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,131
You're so stern.

132
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,005
Butâ¦

133
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,425
I will try and wait
until the season changes once.

134
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,298
"Once?"

135
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,177
Come on, you weren't serious about me.

136
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,101
Yes. Until the season changes once.

137
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,983
This is non-negotiable.

138
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,406
Wait.

139
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,681
It's nice to be older.

140
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,181
No one nags at me even when I play games.

141
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,223
Did I nag at you a lot?

142
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,652
No, when I think about it,
my sisters nagged a lot more.

143
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,233
I can hear them even now.

144
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,528
My son, you look great
when you show your forehead.

145
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,106
No.

146
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,316
If I show my forehead,
it makes me look old.

147
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,866
Do you hate looking old, even at your age?

148
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,792
Yes. I totally hate it.

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,830
You're a baby.

150
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,124
I am a baby.

151
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,997
That's why I can't move out.

152
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,505
Look at you.

153
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,179
You came to tell me to move out, right?

154
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,103
You have to go to work,
so go to bed early.

155
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,311
Mom, I really can't go off on my own.

156
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,101
My sisters were older but stayed.

157
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,944
Why are you doing this to me?

158
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,059
I'm going to use Operation Youngest.

159
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,857
The youngest spends
the least amount of time with his parents.

160
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,691
I get it. Go to bed.

161
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,952
Always picking on me.

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,330
Dad's memories came back.

163
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,085
I liked it when he was romantic.

164
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,895
Sorokdo?

165
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,309
In Goheung, Jeollanam-do?

166
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,147
-That's almost the southern tip.
-It's an island, right?

167
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,283
Is it a place where we must
stay for the night

168
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,400
when the ferries are cut off?

169
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,198
I don't know what you're imagining,

170
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,281
but places like that hardly exist anymore.

171
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,486
They built bridges.

172
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,618
Look at the time, will you?

173
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,915
Sleep in the car. You can't even drive.

174
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,749
Exactly. Why are you taking me so far

175
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,464
when I even have no driver's license?

176
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,677
It's the matter about my sister,
whom you like.

177
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,258
Eun-joo?

178
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,306
What happened to her?

179
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,433
What are you doing?

180
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,765
Are you trying to go hiking?

181
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,851
Good morning.

182
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,816
Not hiking is allowed for a while
even on your day off.

183
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,490
It's not my day off.

184
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
I'm going from Incheon
to Ulsan after lunch.

185
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,783
Then why are you looking for
hiking gear at this early hour?

186
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,866
So you can go hiking again?

187
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,491
No, I'm not.

188
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,212
What is he looking for?

189
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,009
What are you looking for
at this early hour?

190
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,759
I will find it for you.
Don't make the house messy and tell me.

191
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,683
I can't find the letter you wrote to me.

192
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,733
I put it somewhere, and I can't find it.

193
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,566
Are you sure your memories are back?

194
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,204
Good morning.

195
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,957
Dad, I heard your memories came back.

196
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,875
Dad? Donât call me Dad! You're not a kid!

197
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,762
Oh, my Dadâ¦

198
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,431
I mean, your memories did come back.

199
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,038
Why aren't you saying anything?

200
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,580
What should I even say?

201
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,665
How's your sister doing?

202
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,174
She's getting through it.

203
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,418
I can never fully understand
how she feels.

204
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,102
So, you're going to trust your hunch
and go to Sorokdo now?

205
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,143
I wish I would fail too.

206
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,976
But when I ran into him
at the clinic yesterday,

207
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,435
his facial expression seemed like
he saw this coming.

208
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,238
What are you going to do
if those two are there together?

209
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,785
What else can I do?

210
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,866
I'm going to tell them to wrap things up

211
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,997
so Eun-joo would never know.

212
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,779
It's okay with the new patients,

213
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,413
but make sure to check the charts

214
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,319
of re-visiting patients.

215
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,698
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

216
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,997
YOON TAE-HYUNG FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC

217
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,594
You look tired.

218
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,382
I couldn't sleep.

219
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,137
Looks like you couldn't either.

220
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,394
You don't need to worry about the clinic.

221
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,726
The local residents know me
more than Dr. Yoon.

222
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,361
Act naturally in front of the nurses.

223
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,361
Okay.

224
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,401
I'm not worried about the clinic.

225
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,118
They said Dr. Yoon
left the seminar a day early.

226
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,285
Do you know where he goes

227
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,253
whenever he disappears?

228
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm sure he's at Sorokdo.

229
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,426
Sorokdo.

230
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,904
Whenever I went to find him,
he was always alone.

231
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,241
He never made mistakes.

232
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,380
GOHEUNG SPACESHIP OBSERVATORY

233
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,617
Are you here on a trip?

234
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,452
Why are you going in circles
when the peak is right there?

235
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,128
Then why are you also going in circles,
without rushing me?

236
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm waiting thinking that
there must be a reason you're doing this.

237
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,549
People see my brother-in-law

238
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,178
as a son of a successful
family of doctors,

239
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,551
a doctor himself,

240
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,217
and a man who married a fine woman.

241
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,234
Butâ¦

242
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,435
would he really be here?

243
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,518
If he's here,

244
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,113
it means he's going to
give up all of that.

245
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,355
And it also means
none of that made him happy

246
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,163
and he doesn't want to
deceive himself anymore.

247
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,844
If the world had no discrimination,
isn't barbaric, and is nice,

248
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,760
would my brother-in-law
have come out of the closet?

249
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,967
We don't know about that.

250
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,599
There are lots of people who hide it
and reveal it right before death.

251
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,399
It's mom.

252
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,650
I have a bad feeling about this.

253
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,244
Ms. Lee Jin-sook.

254
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,029
Can you talk on the phone right now?

255
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,742
I'm talking on the phone now.

256
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,872
Your brother-in-law
is back in Korea, right?

257
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,449
Rightâ¦

258
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,122
Is he?

259
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,785
He said he'll be back
in two to three days.

260
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,924
You know it so well.

261
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,131
Then I'm sure he is.

262
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,762
Call your sister and tell her
to come visit us with him.

263
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,761
Why did you call me about that?

264
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,263
It's because your
brother-in-law might be tired

265
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,926
after coming back from overseas.

266
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,138
Who was the middle man
when I cut ties with Eun-joo?

267
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,307
Why can't you call them directly?

268
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,556
Who is it that you find difficult?

269
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,768
All right.

270
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,437
I'll call them.

271
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,896
No, don't.

272
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,986
You're right, Mom.

273
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,777
Tae-hyung might be tired

274
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,494
and Eun-joo is grumpy and difficult.

275
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,793
It's right for me to call.

276
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,539
I, the messenger, will call them.

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,790
You're going through a lot,
getting stuck in the middle.

278
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,343
What am I supposed to do?

279
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:46,175
Why is the CEO at Goheung
Space Launch Observatory?

280
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,353
How did he go to a place
380 km away from here?

281
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,734
When he canât even drive?

282
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,060
I guess we're filming a space launch soon.

283
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,726
Yes, awesome.

284
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,614
And he went all the way alone
for field research?

285
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,452
I know, right? He wouldn't do that, huh?

286
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,565
He needs to learn how to drive.
It's so troublesome.

287
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,159
Are you sure you don't know
why he went there?

288
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,076
I donât.

289
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,592
-What?
-Ji-woo.

290
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,420
Is it difficult to talk on the phone
when you're working?

291
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,469
Really difficult.

292
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,467
I'll finish in 30 seconds. How's Dad?

293
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,176
Dad's memories came back.

294
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,176
Really?

295
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,148
Then why is Mom looking for Tae-hyung?

296
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,808
Why? Why is that so?

297
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,527
Eun-hee, you need to come home
this evening.

298
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,650
There's still
the graduation from marriage.

299
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,164
I don't think Mom's going to be
stern about it like before.

300
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,161
Come talk to them.

301
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,750
Not today.

302
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,209
Are you busy?

303
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,788
I'm a bit far away.

304
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,543
I'll talk to Eun-joo, so donât call, okay?

305
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,090
Okay.

306
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,513
My dad's days in his twenties have ended.

307
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,675
I asked him to tell me first
when that happens, butâ¦

308
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,813
Hey, stop calling!

309
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,066
Do you want to take care of
everything yourself?

310
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,938
I'm sure there's a reason
why he's not saying anything.

311
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,784
Right.

312
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,873
If his memories came back,
I'm sure he's in pain.

313
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,536
He should've stayed young a bit longer.

314
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,829
My dad also had

315
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,338
a shining and bright twenties.

316
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,505
But weren't our days
in our twenties totally awful?

317
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,933
We were broke so we collected cybercash
and had terrible sense of style.

318
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,063
Isn't that just you?

319
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,770
I'm still shining brightly.

320
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,765
That's the funniest thing
I've heard recently.

321
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,733
If you were so bright,
why would Yoon-ji marry some other jerk--

322
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,733
Did she send you an invitation, too?

323
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,687
Yoon-ji sent you her wedding invitation?

324
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,741
I really hate girls like that.

325
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,241
She sent me via message
and said she ran out of invitations.

326
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,409
And she sent you an invitation?

327
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,912
That backstabbing witch who broke up

328
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,327
with you all of a sudden.

329
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,575
That was a long time ago.

330
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,383
You drank like crazy at the time.

331
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,670
You almost died
in the valley from drinking.

332
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,257
That brat is shaking up my friend again.

333
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,511
Stop overacting and let's eat. I'm hungry.

334
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,888
Right.

335
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,022
Forget about wedding invitations,
memories and stuff.

336
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,309
Human beings need to eat to survive.

337
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,191
My friend, don't be heartbroken.

338
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,822
I will pay for the meal.

339
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,319
You should pay for the meal

340
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,780
after dragging me all the way here,
don't you think?

341
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,781
Should I?

342
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,358
Yes, you should.

343
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,698
-Dismissed.
-Well done.

344
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,906
Ms. Kim said she may have to
work away until the evening,

345
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,537
so she'll go home right after.

346
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
Yes, writer Choi Dong-ha lives far away.

347
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,837
Vice CEO?

348
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,473
I have something to say.

349
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,312
Iâ¦

350
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,563
I know Ha-ra.

351
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,439
People in our neighborhood
tend to take similar routes.

352
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Kindergarten, elementary,
middle school, high school,

353
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,897
language studies, and studying abroad.

354
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,570
Ms. Seo, you live in that neighborhood?

355
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,655
Yes, the families roughly
know each other too.

356
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,162
-I guess so.
-But,

357
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,327
Ha-ra suddenly contacted me
and said we should meet up.

358
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,964
Actually, we weren't even that close.

359
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:50,257
But she acted like we were best friends.

360
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,295
If you know her, you might know
my relationship with her.

361
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,218
But you must be good at keeping secrets.

362
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,849
Can I tell you my secrets openly later?

363
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,523
See you later.

364
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,791
Was there a letter in
the wedding invitation?

365
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,924
What did the letter sound like?

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,580
"Chan-hyukâ¦

367
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,708
I'mâ¦

368
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,545
getting marriedâ¦"

369
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,631
Was it like this?

370
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,756
Orâ¦ was it like,

371
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,472
"Chan-hyuk, I'm getting married."

372
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,511
What's the difference?

373
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,059
Wellâ¦

374
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,931
If she wrote an ellipsis
with sentimentality,

375
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,187
she wants to keep the memory
and remain a woman.

376
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,849
If she wrote it short and tough,

377
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,767
it means she has no regrets,
and just wants your cash gift.

378
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,647
I think it's neither of those.

379
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,154
So she did write it.

380
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,565
-Wow, what did she write?
-I don't want to tell you.

381
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,526
If you don't tell me,

382
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,735
I'll go to the wedding and ask her myself.

383
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,986
You know I'll do it.

384
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,407
Don't hold back.

385
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,905
Hey.

386
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,417
She wrote I don't have to come

387
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,958
and told me to be happy.

388
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,131
She sent you an invitation,
but told you to not come?

389
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,261
Do you think this makes
sense in terms of context?

390
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,320
I went to Jong-min's wedding to see you.

391
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,071
But you didn't come.
Lots of rumors spread.

392
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,530
I was glad I broke up with you.

393
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,026
Congratulate me on my wedding.

394
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:45,157
P.S. I absolutely reject a wedding
invitation with your name

395
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,536
and Eun-hee's name on it.

396
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,126
What are you going to do now?

397
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,063
SOROKDO CATHEDRAL

398
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,680
He's at Sorokdo Cathedral now.

399
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,808
He's showing his location
way too accurately,

400
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,605
which is even more strange.

401
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,605
Why spend all your energy

402
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,781
on your father, your mother,
and even Eun-joo?

403
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,570
Even if they're your family,
there's nothing you can do now.

404
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,783
Justâ¦

405
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,367
I feel bad, that's all.

406
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,872
I almost cut ties with them

407
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,713
for a long time and lived
my life recklessly.

408
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,579
If I stayed by their sides at the time,

409
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,627
would Dad, Mom, and Eun-joo

410
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,432
have become different from
how they are now?

411
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey, what makes you think

412
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,012
your family will change because of you?

413
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,973
Right?

414
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,307
And you lived recklessly? No, you didn't.

415
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,557
Do you actually know if I lived
recklessly or not?

416
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,556
I lived recklessly.

417
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,732
Let's say you did.

418
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,660
Let's go.

419
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,377
Was it that weird that
I didn't go to Jong-min's wedding?

420
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,014
All of a sudden?
That was like 50,000 years ago.

421
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,644
Yes, it's all in the past.

422
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm wondering if there was a reason
for you not to go to his wedding.

423
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,481
Jong-min didn't even
send me an invitation.

424
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,232
So I thought, "This means
he doesn't want me to come."

425
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,939
He's small-minded and timid.

426
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,823
By the way, how did you know
that I didn't go to the wedding?

427
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,912
They live streamed it
as if it were a royal wedding.

428
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,911
The chatroom blew up about you not coming.

429
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,873
"How loyal." "Awesome." It's going crazy.

430
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,581
Super loyal.

431
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,373
But the end of
that live stream was so bitter.

432
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,963
Everyone was suspecting

433
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
that we were dating.

434
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,383
Thinking that we had an affair
before Jong-pal did.

435
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,717
Some say he's the victim.

436
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,512
Wow, I've never imagined
such a rumor would spread.

437
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,686
What are you doing?

438
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,357
Sorry. I neglected the rumor.

439
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,414
No, I think I watered the rumor
so it can grow fast.

440
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,242
How did you water it?

441
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,537
"Chan-hyuk is actually quite okay."

442
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,132
"Chan-hyuk is thoughtful."

443
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:41,299
"I knew Chan-hyuk
before I knew that bastard Jong-pal."

444
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,261
Are you nuts?

445
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,430
I couldn't help it. I lost my temper.

446
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,639
What's the point of saying it's not true
and that I cut ties with you?

447
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,180
Everyone believed it anyway.

448
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,135
Yes, well done.

449
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,515
That's never going to happen
between us, anyway.

450
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,732
So you gave them a nice big blow.

451
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,983
Right.

452
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,377
I came all the way here,

453
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,009
wishing that it wouldn't be true,

454
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,045
but bad hunches always come true.

455
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,321
Just play your part.

456
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,419
Okay.

457
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,646
How did you find out where I was?

458
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,701
Someone scattered breadcrumbs,

459
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,195
so I could follow them and find you.

460
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,541
It wasn't scattered on purpose.

461
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,615
I'm going to go back anyway,

462
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,205
so you guys go ahead and talk.

463
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,094
Don't you have
the courage to talk with us?

464
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,718
You're good at running away.

465
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,597
You're cowardly, irresponsible,
inconsiderate, and rude.

466
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,725
What a connection you have.

467
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,439
I know this looks weird.

468
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,649
But he disgusts me too,
so don't get any weird ideas.

469
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,956
I didn't know you would come.

470
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,594
I didn't think Eun-joo would tell you.

471
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,086
Eun-joo isn't the type to tell me
things like this.

472
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,843
Even if you hate your wife,
you spent a long time with her.

473
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,974
I saw

474
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,968
your laptop first.

475
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,109
Why would I hate Eun-joo?

476
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,065
That's what happens when I chat.

477
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:56,491
I get smug, boast,
get angry, curse, brag, and giggle.

478
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,325
Why would you do that?

479
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,881
I'm just not good enough, that's all.

480
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,881
Do you know what Eun-joo did?

481
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,723
She totally broke down.
I've never seen her like that.

482
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,509
I was so scared something
might happen to her.

483
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,224
Why did it have to be Eun-joo?

484
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:22,981
At that timeâ¦

485
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,055
we wanted to cut ties with our families.

486
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,232
Both of us were sick and tired
of our families.

487
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,074
"I'm sick and tired of my family."

488
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,493
This is what I hated the most

489
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,286
among all the things my sister said.

490
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,208
What's the name of the bottom side?

491
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,344
A square.

492
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,799
I'm sick and tired of them.

493
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,679
Whether she meant it or not,
that sentence was harsh and hurtful.

494
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,563
Young-sik, that brat.

495
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,898
He's been working at the plant
his entire life.

496
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,613
He has no other skills,
so he can't go anywhere else.

497
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,355
There's no need to go looking for him.

498
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,197
Just have your walkie-talkie on
when you have time.

499
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,794
The sky is beautiful.

500
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,035
What's wrong? I can't get used to this.

501
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,337
It's frustrating.

502
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,380
You're frustrated by me?

503
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,468
Look at your face.

504
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,135
Well, you were very manly,
but this also suited you back in time.

505
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,734
You probably made many women cry.

506
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,232
I don't make women cry.

507
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,992
I didn't, right?

508
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,030
Wellâ¦

509
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,994
You were a CMDT.

510
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,081
CMDT?

511
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,538
Cold Man Driving a Truck.

512
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,909
I'm sure even if you didn't
make them cry directly,

513
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:10,665
I'm sure many women
in the hiking club cried.

514
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,916
Do you think Ms. Sook cried a lot too?

515
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,144
No, I'm sure she didn't cry at all.

516
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,101
You think so?

517
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,805
I'm sure she wanted to kill you.

518
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,444
Even if you look so soft,
you're super picky.

519
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,055
Me?

520
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,527
How was I picky?

521
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,149
We gave our paycheck to our wives

522
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,605
because we're scared of them,
but you kept it for yourself.

523
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,531
And you've been giving your wife

524
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,787
a petty amount of
pocket money your entire life.

525
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,869
I still find it amazing

526
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,214
how she raised three kids
with such a small amount of money.

527
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,711
Because you gave her
a petty amount of pocket money,

528
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,165
she hid the fruit.

529
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,262
Fruit?

530
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,507
Those wretched Korean melons?

531
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,966
I'm not sure if it were Korean melons,

532
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,307
but you said you went home
and saw your wife hiding fruit.

533
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,814
Because you didn't give her much,

534
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,898
I'm sure she wanted to give
expensive fruits to the kids.

535
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,994
They say you get angry
at others for your own mistakes.

536
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,660
You said you turned the house
upside down because of the fruit.

537
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,239
And injured your hand too.

538
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,224
Stop it.

539
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,799
You should never judge
a book by its cover.

540
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,425
I take caution with everything
I do in front of my wife.

541
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,433
But youâ¦

542
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,774
I said stop it!

543
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,731
Damn it!

544
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,992
On-su.

545
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,289
Mom.

546
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,080
I did everything I could.

547
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,964
I was always there to greet him
when he came home.

548
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,804
When we were newlyweds,

549
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,263
he used to run around
looking for me like a kid

550
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,175
throwing a tantrum when I wasn't home.

551
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,936
Mom.

552
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,439
I said it was
when we were newlyweds, right?

553
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,283
Goodness, am I becoming like him?

554
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,700
Why do I keep recalling
the old days recently?

555
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,075
I was so excited about
the thought of leaving everything

556
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
and living alone, I couldn't even sleep.

557
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,035
What should I do?

558
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,627
Jin-sook.

559
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,593
You're early today.

560
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,045
I had some time.

561
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,427
Are you sure you don't need money?

562
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,101
Everyone needs money.

563
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,192
So why do you only do
community service every day?

564
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,358
You need to start working.
You've learned everything.

565
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,692
I'm going to start working soon.

566
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,694
Right, today's the day
Mom takes a bath, right?

567
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,947
Stop calling them "Mom."

568
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,199
The families hate it
when they come to visit.

569
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,371
"Why do you call my Mom 'Mom'?"

570
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,080
"Even if I can't clean her feces,
she's my Mom!"

571
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,233
I see no scarâ¦

572
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,244
That must've been a big injury.

573
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,408
Whyâ¦

574
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,497
Why did she meet a loser like me, andâ¦

575
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,814
HANSUNG NEUROPSYCHIATRY

576
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,520
YOUR REGULAR CHECK-UP
IS ON JULY 8, 1 P.M.

577
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,193
Neuropsychiatry?

578
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,646
WRITE HOW YOU FEEL

579
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,864
I WANT TO KILL MYSELF

580
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,046
The medical noteâ¦

581
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,361
There's a coffee farm nearby.
Want to stop by?

582
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,450
I don't have the car key with me.

583
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,160
I can't drive.

584
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,622
Oh.

585
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,736
I didn't know.

586
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Has anyone asked if you can drive?

587
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,917
Not really.

588
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,380
If they just think I can drive
on their own, and I tell them I can't,

589
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,422
they look at me like, "You useless loser."

590
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,876
Same for me.

591
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,049
"Are you a homosexual?"

592
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,391
No one asks me this.

593
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,177
Can you drive?

594
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,558
We need to talk later alone.

595
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,191
Yes, let's talk later.

596
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,608
Where are they?

597
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,280
Your sister's car is over there.

598
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,208
Whether she was sick and tired of us

599
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,959
or had more serious reasons,

600
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,710
she married you because she loved you.

601
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,337
You knew that and you used her.

602
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,300
I always felt indebted to Eun-joo.

603
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,097
If it were money, I could've paid it back.

604
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,220
But I didn't know
how to do so with feelings.

605
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,180
Butâ¦

606
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,194
as I kept feeling indebted,
I started hating it more.

607
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,478
You hated it? You made her
read all that harsh chats

608
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,817
because you hated it?

609
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,855
Too afraid to face her?

610
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,025
If I told her myselfâ¦

611
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,779
I thought she might try to understand me,

612
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,911
and not know what trash I am.

613
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:56,884
Eun-jooâ¦

614
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,976
Did you drive all the way
here by yourself?

615
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,901
I really can't understand you.

616
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,571
You should've told me if you found him.
Why come?

617
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,741
To take Tae-hyung back to Seoul.

618
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,149
Why did you bring Chan-hyuk?

619
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,952
Do you not use your brain?

620
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,992
Just in case something happens.

621
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,116
What would happen?
What did you think would happen?

622
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,044
Do you need someone to whine to
whenever something happens?

623
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,793
Can't do anything alone, can you?

624
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,955
-Are you on a trip with your friend?
-A trip?

625
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,304
What if he knows?
Does it hurt your dignity?

626
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,760
Can't you just say
that you're having a hard time?

627
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,090
How can I tell you
when you're not trustworthy?

628
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,966
You can't even take care of yourself.

629
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,603
I don't want to see you here anymore. Go.

630
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,266
She has already ended it.

631
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,935
There's no reason to get angry
at someone who's over,

632
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,228
so she's shouting at me,

633
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,935
like how I did to her.

634
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,954
Eun-hee, I think you should go.

635
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,302
I heard you said you wouldn't come.
Why did you?

636
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,176
Let's talk in the room.

637
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,644
-Just talk here.
-Are you hiding something else?

638
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,534
Let's go.

639
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,951
Now?

640
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,947
She said she doesn't want to
see me here anymore.

641
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,873
Did you

642
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,869
tell my sister about this place?

643
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,874
Yes.

644
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,245
How did you find this place?

645
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,881
I heard it from Eun-joo.

646
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,328
You call her Eun-joo?

647
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,918
Yes.

648
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,803
She doesn't care about titles.

649
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,960
Yes, she does.

650
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,757
She totally cares about them.

651
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,389
How did you get here?

652
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,299
He got here on a bus, and he can drive.

653
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,467
I'll give you a ride.

654
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,104
Let's take time to talk
while driving back.

655
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,564
You're really going to leave?

656
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,767
I can leave if I have to.

657
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,611
Why did you bring me here?

658
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,959
Well, this was my first time
coming here, and if I failedâ¦

659
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,461
I wanted to see the ocean and chatâ¦

660
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,336
Enough with excuses. Be honest.

661
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,352
I wanted you to be the first

662
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,310
to know about my sister's situation.

663
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,890
Why?

664
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,649
If she gets worse,

665
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,477
someone has to be by her side,

666
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,279
but I can't be with her all the time,

667
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,860
so I thought it would be good
to share it with you.

668
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,580
Ji-woo shouldn't know about it.

669
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,867
No one knows my family
and my sister as much as you.

670
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,705
It's a relief that he can drive.

671
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,127
You two go ahead first.

672
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,798
Not going to work tomorrow?

673
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,184
I might get fired.

674
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,427
I'm sharing the burden.

675
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,474
I'll stay here, so you go on.

676
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,103
Don't you have work?

677
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,055
I'm a CEO. You're an employee.

678
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,856
Mr. Playboy can defend you
since he's your boss,

679
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,441
but others would say something.

680
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,862
I'll stay here and go back with Eun-joo.
You go first.

681
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,498
Let's go together.

682
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,174
I'm sure they'll take care of it.

683
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,629
I'm worried about Eun-joo, that's why.
It's okay. Just go.

684
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,411
The clinic is open today.

685
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,326
Your mother is there.

686
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,543
I'm closing the clinic.

687
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,963
You're not going to
do it yourself, either.

688
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,338
I'm sure your mother will.

689
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,969
Don't be sarcastic.

690
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,716
My mother thinks I'm a patient.

691
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,385
I hated it. But she dragged me this far.

692
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,194
You shouldn't have done it then.
Don't blame others for it.

693
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,729
I'm not blaming her.

694
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,023
I am going to try changing it now.

695
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,106
You?

696
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,737
You can't change it.

697
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,318
You only know
how to solve things with money.

698
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,155
Did you think Hyo-seok
would take the money?

699
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,627
Is that the price for stealing his lover?

700
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:28,382
I never got in between them.

701
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,147
Were youâ¦

702
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,784
trying to live here
with my brother-in-law?

703
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,573
I'm not the one.

704
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,872
I did date someone who wants to live here.

705
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,541
Heâ¦

706
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,963
He hated coming out
of the closet and fighting

707
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,496
like I did.

708
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,207
And then he got to know someone

709
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,758
who has similar tendencies as him.

710
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,430
He said that he felt like
he met his soulmate.

711
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,018
My brother-in-law?

712
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,980
Yes.

713
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,812
He totally fell for Dr. Yoon,

714
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,361
so he stole my money
and ran away to New Zealand.

715
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,322
Then did you work at that cafe
to have revenge on my brother-in-law?

716
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,364
Rather than revengeâ¦

717
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,532
I just wanted to scare him.

718
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,997
But I became friends
with Eun-joo, and, wellâ¦

719
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,543
I failed.

720
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,379
What is considered
getting in between them?

721
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,126
Is chatting not enough?

722
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,471
Your mother said this.

723
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,640
"My son

724
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,477
never makes mistakes."

725
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,100
Are you saying you didn't make a mistake?

726
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,807
Youâ¦

727
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,239
-Stop being sarcastic.
-Does this sound like sarcasm to you?

728
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,449
Are you offended?

729
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,068
It feels like everyone

730
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,445
is laughing and talking
behind your back, right?

731
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,792
If you're that scared,
why did you chat online?

732
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,368
You couldn't control yourself?

733
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,334
Let go!

734
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,535
Let go!

735
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,211
Let go!

736
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,545
Let go!

737
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,257
Yes.

738
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,350
I knew you would read all the chats.

739
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,522
I'm horrible, aren't I?

740
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,981
Is there anything left to discuss?

741
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,403
You want to end it here.

742
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,230
You always end things clearly.

743
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,475
So why did you come here for?

744
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,278
Don't act like you know everything

745
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,283
like you're wise and not greedy.

746
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,953
Your face and the way
you talk make me sick.

747
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,370
Let go!

748
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,666
Let go!

749
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,877
I said, let go!

750
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,762
Let go!

751
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,630
Let goâ¦

752
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,308
Youâ¦

753
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,029
What did you think
when I was trying so hard to get pregnant?

754
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,998
You know how painful it is

755
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,746
because you're a doctor.

756
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,294
What did you think?

757
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,377
I asked, what did you think!

758
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,266
I detested you.

759
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,572
It was detesting to see

760
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,531
you try so hard to have a family
when you were so sick of them.

761
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,954
You hate your family,
but you're okay with ours?

762
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,576
Did you need
an elevation of social status?

763
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,915
You're a snob.

764
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,211
Detestable and sickening?

765
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,804
That's good.

766
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,051
I have no feelings for you.

767
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,234
And I haven't even gotten started.

768
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,305
EUN-HEE

769
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,062
I'm still in Goheung.

770
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,814
If you still want to go with us,
we'll go pick you up.

771
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,873
Bye.

772
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,798
Today is such a long day.

773
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,339
Here.

774
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,052
Did I sleep like a monster?

775
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,759
I wasn't looking.

776
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,344
So you weren't interested.

777
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,638
I'll drive from here.

778
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,811
It's okay.

779
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,731
What's your relationship with Chan-hyuk?

780
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,813
We're university friends.

781
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,686
Does Chan-hyuk like Eun-joo?

782
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,278
Do you always show
your thoughts on your face?

783
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,451
He liked her before.

784
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,332
You know, what all guys do.

785
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,239
Having a crush on a friend's sister.

786
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,908
I'm a guy, but I didn't do that.

787
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,956
Is see.

788
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,418
DId you crush on a friend's brother?

789
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,342
You slept well in the car.

790
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,588
You're not feeling good
right now, are you?

791
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,893
I feel bad for Eun-jooâ¦

792
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,515
but I feel relieved.

793
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,179
To be honestâ¦

794
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,101
I never liked my brother-in-law.

795
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,105
I always thought
he was cold, authoritative,

796
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,399
and selfish.

797
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:50,824
Butâ¦

798
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,408
when I think that he's been
deceiving himself all his life,

799
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:57,871
I can understand.

800
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,417
Hating someone is also a waste of energy

801
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,633
and since I'm not anymoreâ¦

802
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,134
So I feel much relieved.

803
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,716
I sent Eun-hee back.

804
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,928
You have to give me a ride. I can't drive.

805
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,571
Is that so?
Then why didn't you go with her?

806
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,654
I told her I'll stay.

807
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:38,872
I didn't thinkâ¦

808
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,537
Eun-hee would find this place.

809
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,502
She said it was a pure hunch.

810
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,167
I didn't think she had a hunch.

811
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,128
Eun-hee actually has quite good hunches.

812
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,672
Although dense.

813
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,642
I'm sure she brought you here
because she's dense.

814
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,469
Perhaps she brought me here
because she has a good hunch.

815
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,821
But us two going back to Seoul
together may seem weird.

816
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,651
That's Eun-hee's true talent.

817
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,412
The talent for making things weird.

818
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,079
The talent for making things weird
and escaping on her own.

819
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,329
Do you know who Eun-hee
went back to Seoul with?

820
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,877
The barista.

821
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,182
I'm actually laughing, surprisingly.

822
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,096
So this is how it feels to be comforted.

823
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,628
I'm going back with Eun-joo.

824
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,216
She's fine, so don't worry.

825
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,302
Just you and her?

826
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,597
What about my brother-in-law?

827
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,153
Thanks.

828
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,655
You've done so much.

829
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,382
I have something for you.

830
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,804
I'll wait at the cafe around your house.

831
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,841
ACTUALLY, Iâ¦

832
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,766
I'm almost there, so don't run away.

833
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,984
OKAY

834
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,740
It's because I have nothing.

835
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,995
How could I do something
even a barbarian wouldn't do?

836
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,997
Throwing fists at homeâ¦

837
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,671
Bleedingâ¦

838
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,625
How can I be forgiven for such a sin?

839
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,376
YOUNGER DAUGHTER

840
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,766
-Dad.
-Hello.

841
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,515
My Eun-hee.

842
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,654
Yes, this is your Eun-hee.

843
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,110
Don't you have something to say to me?

844
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,153
What?

845
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,241
Did you forget the promise
you made with me?

846
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,573
What was it?

847
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,657
I heard your memories came back.

848
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,002
Right.

849
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,290
Dad, what happened to your voice?
Did you catch a cold?

850
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,746
No.

851
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,259
Tell me your driving schedule.

852
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,465
I'll go see you.

853
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,601
-Okay.
-Yes.

854
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:35,937
Ah, I'm tired.

855
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,479
I'm getting old.

856
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,357
We're family, but we don't know.

857
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,324
We don't know if we don't tell.

858
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,958
It's so good to be with you, Ms. Sook.

859
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,804
Ms. Jin-sook, I love you.

860
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,598
I really, truly love you.

861
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,983
Everything shone brightly since you came.

862
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,811
Thank you, Ms. Sook.

863
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:23,986
I'm so thankful for being with
a lacking jerk like me.

864
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,985
After all this timeâ¦

865
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,204
how can he try to stop me?

866
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,834
After all this timeâ¦

867
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,968
Ms. Lee Jin-sook, this is your messenger.

868
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,684
Yes, did you talk to your sister
on the phone?

869
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,845
Your expectation was right.

870
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,314
Did something happen?

871
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,395
Tae-hyung was on the plane
for so long going back and forth.

872
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,571
He's not feeling well.

873
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,610
I'll tell them to call tomorrow
or the day after.

874
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,454
Is Tae-hyung badly ill?

875
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:12,069
It's not that bad. Donât worry.
They'll call you soon.

876
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,782
Okay.

877
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:14,988
Mom.

878
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,117
What happened to your voice?

879
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,624
Did you catch a cold?

880
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,536
Dad sounded like he caught a cold, too.

881
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,039
A cold?

882
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,052
He was fine in the morning.

883
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,842
Mom, I have to go. Bye.

884
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,729
If you always answer the phone
with a calm voice,

885
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,490
although you're sometimes heartbroken,

886
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,451
then they will never know
until you tell them.

887
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,752
You look tired.

888
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,916
I'm fine.

889
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,795
Come to work tomorrow with this.

890
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,261
It's the project plan
for writer Choi Dong-ha.

891
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,092
This is enough to say you worked away.

892
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:04,274
I can read "Thank you,
thank you so much!" on your face.

893
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,483
Do you want pizza and beer?

894
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,903
If you do a bottoms-up

895
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,651
with the first glass of beer
when you're tired,

896
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,454
your arms and legs feel relaxed,
your brain gets dizzy,

897
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,448
and you get confident.

898
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,373
That's some amazing flirting skills.

899
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,080
Look here. This is not a flirting skill.

900
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,748
This is just a drink with a coworker.

901
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,536
Or with a boss.

902
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,634
Are you drunk after drinking one bottle?

903
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,546
Iâ¦

904
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,429
I couldn't sleep last night,

905
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,522
and I got up in the morning
and drove to Goheung.

906
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,479
Plus, I hardly ate anything the whole day.

907
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,606
I had some lunch.

908
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,241
Wow, you drove all the way there?

909
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,498
Did you go with that friend?

910
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,922
Well, it's a bitâ¦

911
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,717
complicated.

912
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,852
I realize that what I just said
can cause misunderstandings.

913
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,516
I didnât ask you for your help

914
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,231
to go and have fun with my friend.

915
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,028
I don't get any wrong ideas.

916
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,819
I just want to know
what this complicated matter is,

917
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,783
and I want to comfort you.

918
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,043
Because you're the one I love.

919
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,308
Although I didn't want it,
thank you for today.

920
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,687
It seems like you're okay now,
but when you're home aloneâ¦

921
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,477
The emotions will come back.

922
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,699
You should stay at
Eun-hee's house for a while.

923
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,495
I don't know where she lives.

924
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,212
I realized that just now.

925
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,298
I can take care of myself. Go home now.

926
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,256
Do you have something to say?

927
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:50,191
Haven't you thought that all of my actions
are the actions of a man in love?

928
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:51,849
I thinkâ¦

929
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,266
I tried not to think so.

930
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,397
Why?

931
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,861
Because we slept together
the first day we met?

932
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,374
Andâ¦

933
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,792
you donât know me that well.

934
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,130
I know you very well, Eun-hee.

935
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,051
When the meeting is boring,

936
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,758
you write the Chinese character
"Taoist Immortal."

937
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:20,259
Because you like the meaning

938
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,931
of a person leaning on a mountain.

939
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,759
You don't like taking sides either,

940
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,812
so you don't take anyone's side
in a meeting.

941
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:31,521
You're the second daughter, stuck
in between the eldest and the youngest.

942
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,402
The name of your email

943
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,979
is the main character
from Pride and Prejudice,

944
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,475
Liz.

945
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,146
The email address?

946
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,235
You always translated my username

947
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,320
and referred to me as that.

948
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,910
Thistleâ¦

949
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,330
You meanâ¦

950
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,209
Yes.

951
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,171
I'm Thistle.

952
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,050
I had a great time too and thank you.

953
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,761
Thistle,

954
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,512
Be happy.

955
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,184
I'm the one you've been emailing

956
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,393
for more than a year.

957
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,268
No way.

958
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,981
Thistle is a cute
and capable female student

959
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,941
in her early twenties who lives overseas!

960
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,151
Yes.

961
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,571
Because she's cute and capable,

962
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,240
she got a better-paying job

963
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,648
in less than a week.

964
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,405
So I got to use her email.

965
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,741
I tried to tell youâ¦

966
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,413
but it was so much fun,

967
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,155
so I decided to pretend to be her.

968
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,576
Then I became interested in you.

969
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,669
I came here because I wanted to see you

970
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,915
and fell in love.

971
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,516
It was an honest conversation
between women.

972
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,732
I thought you wouldn't have opened up

973
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,397
if I revealed my identity.

974
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,945
I think I said inappropriate things, too.

975
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,450
I'm telling you.

976
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,374
We mostly talked about books, authors,

977
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,952
and work.

978
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,157
We related to each other so well.

979
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,673
You still should've
revealed your identity.

980
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:23,876
You seeâ¦

981
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,132
At first, I missed the timing.

982
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,598
Then, I just didn't want to reveal it.

983
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,179
Why not?

984
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,394
Because I liked your writings.

985
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,889
They made me laugh

986
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,226
and they comforted me.

987
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,016
And it was heartwarming.

988
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,025
Then you shouldn't have told me.

989
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,951
It's embarrassing because it feels like
my shameful secret has been revealed.

990
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:03,921
I'll get going.

991
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:04,964
All right.

992
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,682
Right when I thought I fell in love,

993
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,821
I heard another sound
that knocked on my heart.

994
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,279
And I badly wished that sound

995
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,333
wasn't you.

996
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,164
I want to know why
you're ignoring my calls and texts.

997
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:04,076
They say you should give up
if your heart doesn't flutter.

998
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,916
I don't want to be a man
who's jealous of your friend.

999
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,632
You wereâ¦

1000
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,093
particularly cold to me and Dad.

1001
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,554
October 13. That was the day
I proposed to your mother.

1002
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,136
-They said I tried to kill myself.
-Try reading the diary!

1003
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,723
I've been holding back
because of the kids.

1004
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:21,977
I wasâ¦

1005
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,979
done a long time ago.

1006
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:30,108
