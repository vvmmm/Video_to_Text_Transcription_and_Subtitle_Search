00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,598
Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,335
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,467
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,877
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,347
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,078
Lockup!
Lockup!

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,829
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,914
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,356
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,758
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,353
Bastards.

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,297
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,833
Fall in on the wing!

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,704
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, now, wake up!

15
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,435
Wake up!
Fall in on the wing!

16
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,374
No!

17
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,208
Shut up!
Shut your mouth!

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,181
- What's your name?
- Help me, please! Help me!

19
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,217
- What's your name?!
- Officer Smedley.

20
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,719
Your first name, shithead.
What's your name?

21
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,187
- What's your name?!
- Peter. Peter Smedley.

22
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,348
Right, Peter.

23
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,585
I want you to get me
10 grand, cash.

24
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,594
Used notes.
And I want a car.

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,061
Stay where you are!

26
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,463
Anybody moves,
I'll cut her throat.

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,330
You know my name, do you?

28
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,495
Do you know who I am?

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,594
Johnny Franks!

30
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,867
All right, Johnny.
Just don't hurt her.

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,341
Don't you Johnny me,
you two-faced piece of shit!

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,344
Please, please, please.

33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,411
You've got 15 minutes.

34
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,004
Go on!
Get me what I want.

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,016
I can't get that much money
in 15 minutes, Mr. Franks.

36
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,143
For every five minutes,
she loses a finger.

37
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,550
- No, no! Please!
- You hear me?!

38
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,557
Help! Please!

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,558
What you waiting for?

40
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,688
You've got 15 minutes
to do what I want.

41
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,096
I mean it.
I'll chop off her fingers.

42
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,795
- No! Please!
- And then her hands!

43
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,895
Get the armed response group.
Shoot him.

44
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,100
Give it 20 minutes.
We'll do a round.

45
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,107
I'll give you the lowdown

46
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,735
who's got to be monitored
throughout the night.

47
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,370
- You off, then?
- Yes.

48
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,023
Oh, listen, you ain't met
the new lad, have you?

49
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,175
This is the dep, Gary Marshall.
Jason Hully.

50
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,342
How you going?

51
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,977
- Russell, got a minute, please?
- Yeah.

52
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,213
Excuse me.

53
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,316
What are you after?

54
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,450
Udding's got the flu
as well as Michaels and Norton.

55
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,461
It's leaving us short-staffed
at the healthcare center.

56
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,326
- No.
- Oh, come on, Russ.

57
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,127
I need an S.O. on duty.

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,964
We've got three new arrivals
coming in early.

59
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:15,968
Please.

60
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,380
I've got to be out of here
by lunchtime.

61
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,872
I am taking Nora to homecare.

62
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,398
We are in the middle of
decorating, and you owe me.

63
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,156
If I go straight to the hospital
from here,

64
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,340
I have been on
18 hours straight.

65
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,791
Earn enough
to pay for the decorator?

66
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,750
- Good.
- Git.

67
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,555
- Oh, Russell?
- Yeah?

68
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,716
It's our turn
for the jungle man.

69
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,555
He's being transferred
back to us.

70
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,117
Oh, you bastard.

71
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,356
He's one of
your new admittances.

72
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,625
No way.

73
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,133
We're getting the cage
ready for him.

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,362
- Oh, no!
- Time's up, you bastards!

75
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,631
I'm gonna rape her.

76
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,538
You hear me?
I'm gonna rape the bitch!

77
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,066
So who is the jungle man, then?

78
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,113
Name's Victor Braithwaite.

79
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,445
Changed it by deed poll
to Tarzan.

80
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,042
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking, son.

81
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,030
He's a bloody nightmare.

82
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,080
Settle down, now.

83
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,923
I'm coming out.
I'm coming out.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,074

00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,606
Oh, bloody hell.

87
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,875
No!

88
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,417
Congratu-bloody-lations.

89
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,975
You just shot the governor.

90
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,749
Okay, everybody.
Coffee break.

91
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,348
And then we'll meet up
back in classroom 4B.

92
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,723
- All right?
- She was good, wasn't she?

93
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,222
You were a bit rough.

94
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,740
You wanted it
to look good, didn't you?

95
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,131
Well, I think you were
rather enjoying yourself.

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,362
Do it differently
in the U.S., do they?

97
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,875
Yes, they do, actually,
Dr. Williams.

98
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,343
You should sit in
on one my lectures.

99
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,304
You might learn something.

100
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,863
- Oh, yeah?
- Joke. Just a joke.

101
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,569
He needs to
keep the neck raised,

102
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,508
and get him X-rayed, will you?

103
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,945
Oh, and, uh,
get rid of that contraption.

104
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,916
- Hey, Doc.
- Morning, Doc.

105
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,647
Here you are. Haven't had
a chance to look at 'em yet.

106
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,622
Falla.

107
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,995
Doc... Denny, Dougherty.

108
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,373
Falla.
Where do you want this one?

109
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,196
Uh, that cubicle
will be fine over there.

110
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,735
Dougherty?

111
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,963
Let's have a look.

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,632
Falla, hurry it up.
Doctor is gonna examine you.

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,941
Come on, Falla,
get your bunk made up.

114
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,211
You ready for this one, Doc?

115
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,395
Just a moment.
I'm gonna be a little while yet.

116
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,945
You are not that sick.

117
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,759
And that should not be here.

118
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,880
Any discomfort there?

119
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,750
Doc, I need to
get back on the wing.

120
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,120
Be as right as rain
in a couple of days, mate.

121
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,590
Right.
Who's next?

122
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,729
Prisoner 457.
George Falla.

123
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,706
Oh, I... I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee.

124
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,934
Sure thing.

125
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,703
Cup of coffee for the doctor,
please.

126
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,336
I've just had confirmation
to stand by for delivery

127
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:50,680
of transportee prisoner...
Tarzan?

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,719
Got S.O. Russell Morgan
standing in,

129
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,449
but I'm still a man short,
and Russell's been on all night.

130
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,287
- Where is the governor?
- Try the staff room.

131
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,419
She ran Barfield for about 18
months during the refurbishment,

132
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,156
until she got the old...

133
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,823
Then I heard she went to America

134
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,298
to do some research
or something.

135
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,877
She weren't high enough rank
to run it.

136
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,461
Prison services gave her
a cushy research job

137
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,766
traveling 'round America.

138
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,037
Hey, Curtis, is it true
she was sacked from Barfield?

139
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,676
Hello again.

140
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,346
Right, for those of you
I haven't officially met before,

141
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,322
my name is Helen Hewitt,
I'm a governor two.

142
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,952
I've been working for almost
two years in the United States

143
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,121
studying their category A prison
regimes,

144
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,756
their hostage
and siege procedures.

145
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:43,702
And for your information
Miss, um, Stapleton,

146
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,898
I was not sacked from Barfield.

147
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,203
I was at the time
only a governor three,

148
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,971
and I'm sure
you're aware of the fact

149
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,171
that in order to run
a category A prison,

150
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,770
you must be a governor two.

151
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,458
I wanted to fill the governor in

152
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,291
on the jungle man,
Victor Braithwaite.

153
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,295
I thought he was dead.

154
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,299
Tried everywhere. Couldn't find
the governor anywhere.

155
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,301
I've got
a list of transfers here.

156
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,631
Unbelievable.

157
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,298
Do you know, since 1994,

158
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,571
Tarzan has been in Wakefield,
Strangeways,

159
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,580
Barfield, Walton,
Winson Green, Lincoln,

160
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,775
Bullingdon, Full Sutton,
and Durham.

161
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,873
Now, that's not all.

162
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,183
He's even been back
to Strangeways, Frankland,

163
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,315
back to High Down,
Winson Green again,

164
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,881
Lincoln...
Poor bastards have had him

165
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,518
three times already this year...

166
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,926
Frankland
he only lasted eight days,

167
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,329
and Bullingdon he lasted 10.

168
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,104
If Tarzan
carries on like this any more,

169
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,665
he'll spend more time traveling

170
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,987
than he does
in the bloody nicks.

171
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,037
He'll just go
straight to the block, then.

172
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,173
And chop his head off, yeah.

173
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,182
Yeah?

174
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,445
Speaking.

175
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,350
What?

176
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,752
Where's Williams?

177
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,312
Where can I contact him?

178
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,858
Newgate House.

179
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,086
Shit. Okay.

180
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,093
Tarzan arrived?

181
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:52,121
Find Governor Keller ASAP,
and contact Dr. Williams.

182
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,928
- Wife had the baby?
- Get him back here.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,731
Mrs. Gill, get me the records of
a new inmate that arrived today,

184
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,396
George Falla.

185
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,940
I'll contact HQ, the press
office, and the police.

186
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,476
We have a hostage situation.

187
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,467
Why are you doing this, George?
Tell us what you want.

188
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,815
Come on, George, stop
pratting about and talk to me.

189
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,481
Who's out there?
Who's out there?

190
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,558
Who's there?!

191
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,027
- George, calm down.
- What's happening?

192
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:22,926
George.

193
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,965
Open that door
a fraction, and he hangs.

194
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,866
I've got a rope attached
to the door, and I'll hang him!

195
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,063
Yeah, I'll hang him!

196
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,402
George.
Be reasonable, George.

197
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,742
I won't talk to anyone
but the frigging governor!

198
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,111
I want my mother.

199
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,640
I want a blow-up rubber doll.

200
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,883
I want the governor
to blow it up!

201
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,583
Shitface.

202
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,962
Nobody listens to me.

203
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,966
Nobody pays any attention to me.

204
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,266
Now they will.

205
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,972
Right, Chiswick,
what's going on?

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,872
He wants the governor,
he wants his mother,

207
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,386
and you ain't gonna
believe this, sir,

208
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,504
but he wants
a blow-up rubber doll.

209
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,344
What? What is this,
some sort of bloody wind-up?

210
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,348
I don't know.

211
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,227
Try and talk to him,
he jabs it through the door

212
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,184
with a broken bottle.

213
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,345
How did he get a bottle?

214
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,889
He's had some medication. He's
got inflammation of the bowels.

215
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,356
Here's his medical report.

216
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,519
Right, I want
all the corridors cleared.

217
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,358
Get everybody out now!

218
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,126
Vacate the cells
either side of him.

219
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,043
We don't want him to hear
what's going on, do we?

220
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,558
Right, Doc,
anyone spoken to Russell?

221
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,126
No, we can't.

222
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,104
Well, we haven't got his records
in the office.

223
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,367
What's the bastard in for?

224
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,932
We don't know. All we've got is
the last prison doc's reports.

225
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,841
- Who's out there?!
- Calm down.

226
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,642
Who's out there?!
Who's there?!

227
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,411
Right, I want all these screens
in a line across there,

228
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,123
mask off the end
of the whole of the wing.

229
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,813
Hey, find out
Morgan's blood group.

230
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,981
What else is on his medical?
Is he mental?

231
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,580
You shouldn't even be
in this area.

232
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,657
Is he suffering from...

233
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,125
He'll suffer
if I get hold of him.

234
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,403
George, you're not
listening to me.

235
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,451
I want my mother!

236
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,806
George, you've got to calm down!

237
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,856
George, you've got to calm down!

238
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,061
I want a blow-up rubber dolly!

239
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,070
Where are the ruddy negotiators?

240
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,800
It makes sense to me
if I act as go-between.

241
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,432
Sick!

242
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,571
They've been poisoning me.

243
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,648
I know.

244
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,617
Look, George, I'm a decent man.

245
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,085
- A fair man.
- Trying to give me drugs.

246
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,122
Talk to me.

247
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,215
What have you done
to Officer Morgan?

248
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,088
George!

249
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,357
I am not sick in the head!

250
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,523
Three basic rules.

251
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,363
One, protection of life.

252
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,403
Two, negotiation.

253
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,496
Three, no concessions.

254
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,007
Do you know,
in the past five years

255
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,169
there have been 80 hostage
incidents in British prisons.

256
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,646
In 60 of those incidents,
it was a prisoner taken hostage.

257
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,478
The rest were prison staff.

258
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,075
75% of them used barricades.

259
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,882
What about weapons?

260
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,514
80% had weapons present.

261
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,150
To date we have no record
of firearms being used.

262
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,991
In only two of those incidents,

263
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,590
there resulted serious injury
to the hostage,

264
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,497
which means a high proportion
were resolved

265
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,695
with no injury to either party.

266
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,897
Luckily Officer Jackson
wasn't on duty.

267
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,875
So no fatalities?

268
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,774
There's always a first time.

269
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,938
Never, ever believe

270
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,472
that a hostage situation
cannot spiral into tragedy.

271
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,781
I've got everything I need
in here.

272
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,349
Got smokes.

273
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,983
I got weapons!

274
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,494
I want my mother!

275
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:46,260
Come on, George.
I'm the prison doctor.

276
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,735
Do you need any medication?

277
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,212
I want to talk to the governor

278
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,432
about visitation rights!

279
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,031
- No panic.
- About ruddy time.

280
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,577
- How's Mr. Morgan?
- What the hell is <i>he</i> doing?!

281
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,942
Falla was sick.

282
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,503
He was trying to find out
how bad.

283
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,139
- There was nobody else.
- What?

284
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,117
Because we haven't got a bloody
negotiator down here yet!

285
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,117
How's Mr. Morgan?

286
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,564
- Where the hell have you been?
- Sorry, I was playing squash.

287
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,988
Who's been handling it?

288
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,854
- Doc Harris.
- Just stay calm.

289
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:16,862
You're gonna need
some medication.

290
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,626
I've seen your medical records.

291
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,039
I'm gonna kill him.

292
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,701
I'm gonna kill him!

293
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,710
Hey, hey!

294
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,144
All right, lads.
All right, lads.

295
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,177
No, don't want to
leave my name, mate,

296
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,221
because I'm calling
from Barfield Prison.

297
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,188
Yeah, I've got a big story.

298
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,988
And all I want
is a little request for my wife.

299
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,359
Could you hurry it up,
or my card's gonna run out.

300
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,022
Step back!

301
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,588
He's got me phone card.

302
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,810
He said he'd be a minute.
He's been three minutes already.

303
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,699
He's on his way.

304
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,080
Yeah, but I need the card.
I want to phone me Auntie Betty.

305
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,766
- You, you...
- It's his card he's using.

306
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,933
Hello?
Okay, listen.

307
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,874
I want it played three times.

308
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,377
Yeah. Three.

309
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,107
For Cheryl Smith.

310
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,844
Roy Orbison... "It's Over."

311
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,317
Okay?

312
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,183
Right, there's an officer.

313
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,313
He's been held hostage
since 9:00 this morning.

314
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,483
He's a senior officer,
name of Russell Morgan.

315
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,050
What? I don't know.
He's a new inmate, that's all.

316
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,323
But he's armed,
and he's very, very dangerous.

317
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,490
How? Well, he's got
his bloody head in a noose...

318
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,534
Hello? Hello?

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,091
Shit.

320
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,535
Bang out of order.

321
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,129
Got me card, Brian!

322
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,674
Come on, Smith.
On your way.

323
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,007
- He needs to phone his auntie.
- Got to phone me auntie.

324
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,909
- Here.
- Your card's run out.

325
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,608
Oh, you bastard.
I told you I needed that.

326
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,083
Now you owe me, Smith.
I want another card.

327
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,711
Shut it, four eyes.
You'll get paid off.

328
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,947
Oh, four eyes, is it?

329
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,012
Pack it in, youse two.
Pack it in!

330
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,684
Mellowing out. All right.
Later. Later.

331
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,404
I'm getting tired of waiting.

332
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,338
Bastard!

333
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,784
Is my mother coming in or not?

334
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,945
Hey!

335
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,318
Who's out there?

336
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,085
Why they bloody sent him
to us...

337
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,158
Bastards!

338
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,888
Gary, I can't leave
the command post.

339
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,138
Can you go and check
at reception

340
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,154
for that nutter
calling himself Tarzan?

341
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,562
He's scheduled any minute now.

342
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,794
Anyone contacted Morgan's wife?

343
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,497
He's not even supposed to be
on duty, you know?

344
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,164
I'll sort it.

345
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:48,376
<i>Just treat us as if we were
second-degree citizens.</i>

346
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,417
I know my rights.

347
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,617
This is a protest.

348
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,014
This is a protest!

349
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,550
It is imperative

350
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,085
that you never give in
to the demands of the prisoner.

351
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,065
The aim is to
keep the perpetrator talking.

352
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,931
Keep his attention drawn to you,

353
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,970
listening to you,
arguing with you.

354
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,666
Talking to him, not at him.

355
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,072
And if a hostage screams
that she's being raped,

356
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,337
don't dismiss it.

357
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,675
Ah, yes, but what if he <i>is</i>
chopping fingers off?

358
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,145
Well, he <i>said</i> he will.

359
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,308
Doesn't necessarily mean
he'll carry it through.

360
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,578
But it's a good point,
Mr. Jackson.

361
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,088
So it's also important
that you get on hand

362
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,557
all information
regarding the perpetrator.

363
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,786
What is his crime?

364
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,456
Has he done this before?
Has he a history of violence?

365
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,055
Is he a violent man?

366
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,724
Is he on medication?

367
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,326
Does he have a history
of mental illness?

368
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,804
The negotiator must get to know
the perpetrator.

369
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,341
And he'll have on hand,

370
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,967
to feed him advice
on how to handle him,

371
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,568
the prison psychologist.

372
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,580
What about providing food?

373
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,279
No concessions.

374
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,286
If the perpetrator
asks for food, drug it.

375
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,152
Drug him up.
When he keels over, walk in.

376
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,717
What if he gives the food
to the hostage?

377
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,853
Makes him drink it,
makes him eat him, waits?

378
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,127
He'll know,
he'll become very angry,

379
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,861
and he won't trust
the negotiator,

380
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,096
and they must trust each other.

381
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,638
Okay, that's lunch, everybody.

382
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,300
And then straight back, and
we'll pick up where we left off.

383
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,901
I want a blow-up rubber dolly!

384
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,175
I want my mother!

385
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,956
I want my mother!

386
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,391
Oh, come on, George.

387
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,429
Can we see Mr. Morgan?

388
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,796
I want to see my mother!

389
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,931
I'm gonna start
messing with him!

390
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,768
I mean it.

391
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,107
I mean it!

392
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,579
I'm gonna start cutting him!

393
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,919
Williams isn't here,

394
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,822
the doctor's having kittens
trying to talk the nutter down,

395
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,291
and here comes
the biggest nutter of all time.

396
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,351
Said something
about needing a blanket.

397
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,691
What's that about?

398
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,073
Well, they transport him naked.

399
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,929
Have you not met
this character yet?

400
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,831
You're in
for a show and a half, son.

401
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,579
The money it costs
shuttling Tarzan around,

402
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,629
they could have built
his own private wing.

403
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,343
This one's sane.
We've got it on paper.

404
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,436
He's got a new gig by the way.
Spits like a llama.

405
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,074
Here for me, are you?!

406
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,779
Aaaaaah!

407
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,049
Quick!

408
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,656
Wrap him in this.

409
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,822
Hurry up!
Stop wasting time.

410
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,164
Oh! Dirty bastard!

411
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:54,859
Get him in here.

412
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,027
Drop him.
Wrap him in it.

413
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,502
Oh, no need for that.

414
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,936
- And take him away!
- Show's over.

415
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,439
Come on, let's go.

416
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,099
Good to see you again,
Mr. Marshall.

417
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,143
Likewise.

418
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,408
Is Mr. Jackson
not rejoining us?

419
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,283
No, he's been recalled
to Barfield.

420
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,845
Oh. Pity.

421
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,087
Okay.

422
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,924
The security
of our modern prison cells

423
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,524
means that access or exit
via the windows is impossible.

424
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,659
Same with the doors.

425
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,034
Well, with effective removal
of doors, under a minute.

426
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,905
In the States, they've got it
down to three seconds.

427
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,638
Now, you can't see
inside the cell,

428
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,475
so it could be booby-trapped.

429
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,980
Any suggestions?

430
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,909
Nothing from you,
Miss Stapleton?

431
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,587
Sorry, ma'am.
Can you come to the phone?

432
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,923
It's HQ.
They said it's very urgent.

433
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,123
Come on, George.

434
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,894
It's after 4:00.

435
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,128
This has gone on long enough.

436
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,030
Ah!

437
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,173
Now, you saw that.

438
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,441
Could have broken my nose.

439
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,747
Instead it's given me
a headache.

440
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,288
I've got a headache!

441
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,060
This had gone on
long enough, George.

442
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,305
You've pissed your pants.

443
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,956
If they open that door,
I'll pull your chair away.

444
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,535
Then your neck'll break.

445
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,817
You know what happens
when you get strangled?

446
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,777
All your bodily functions
happen.

447
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,844
Pblt!

448
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,540
Yo, Smith.

449
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,485
You owe me, mate.

450
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,488
One phone card.

451
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,421
Piss off.
It's not my fault it ran out.

452
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,982
Course it is, man.
You used it.

453
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,119
Now, you'd better get me
another one.

454
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,955
- Are you threatening me?
- Well, I might be.

455
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,989
Yeah?
Just do it.

456
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,591
Eugene!
It's him!

457
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,637
See, I was right!

458
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,104
Tarzan!
It's me... Brian!

459
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,034
Tarzan! It's me!

460
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,909
Stop pushing, Smith! Why do you
need to frigging push?

461
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,675
Well, you can't see now,
can you?

462
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,582
Tarzan, it's me... Brian!

463
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,120
Told you he was me mate!

464
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,520
See that?
It's me... Brian!

465
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,367
There you are.
I told you I knew him, didn't I?

466
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,451
He's my mate.
Tarzan!

467
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,017
It's Brian!

468
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,462
Get off him, Buffy!
Buffy, get off him.

469
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,527
Do you hear me?!

470
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,334
I want the local radio station.

471
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,568
What's the waveband?!

472
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,744
Do you know?

473
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,300
Oh.

474
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,637
Sorry.

475
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,515
- Officer held at knifepoint.
<i>- Past the Classic FM.</i>

476
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,455
That's Russell's voice.

477
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,392
He's talking to him.
The gag's off.

478
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:22,400
Just turn the dial
past the Classic FM.

479
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,898
That's what I do.

480
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,997
<i>Do you know why I'm doing this?</i>

481
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:34,408
'Cause no one pays me
any attention!

482
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,482
Nobody pays me...

483
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,584
any attention.

484
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,120
I will, George.

485
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,993
I'll listen to you.

486
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,228
You got me here, so talk to me.

487
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,494
I will listen to you.

488
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,385
Ah, no!

489
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,552
- Oh, God.
- Russell?

490
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,090
You talk to them...

491
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,887
Are you all right?

492
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,983
And you're dead.

493
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,653
George, what's going on there?

494
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,192
Okay.

495
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,594
Okay.

496
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,440
You see?

497
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,746
I have been poisoned.

498
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:54,892
And I know who is doing it,
but they refuse to listen to me.

499
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,029
Oh!

500
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,588
It's arsenic.

501
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,294
You've got inflammation of
the bowel, that's all, George.

502
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,101
No, I have not!

503
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,108
That's what they said
my dad had.

504
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,081
He died in agony, my dad.

505
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,142
Thank you, Mr. Andrews.

506
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,314
HQ are sending us an experienced
hostage negotiator

507
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,153
and replacement
for Dr. Williams.

508
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,852
- Be with us shortly.
- Shortly?

509
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,984
Oh, well, that's great.

510
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,461
In the meantime,
Falla's screaming blue murder

511
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,191
about being fed arsenic.

512
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,392
He thinks
someone's poisoned him.

513
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,094
Let me have a go.

514
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,399
If anyone goes down
on that wing, it'll be me.

515
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,462
I've been doing the negotiating
training, Gary.

516
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,583
That's what I've been doing.

517
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:45,066
As HOC, Gary, you go down.

518
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,579
It's a complete breach
of the rules.

519
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,083
Hmm. Been more than a few
breaches already, Governor.

520
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,716
Got a frigging hostage,
have you?

521
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,816
You might just get another one
when I get out.

522
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,360
Dickhead.

523
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,156
Hey, I'll snatch
the ruddy governor.

524
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,492
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,295
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

526
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,735
I need me glasses.
I can't see without me glasses.

527
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,481
I'm due out
in a frigging few weeks.

528
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:17,101
I mean, as if I'd do anything.
I mean, I never touched nobody.

529
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,736
This isn't fair.
It's not fair.

530
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,145
- This is your fault, Eugene!
- Bollocks!

531
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,342
- It's your fault!
- Oi! Stop gassing!

532
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,942
- In your cell.
- You're an Uncle Tom.

533
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,786
I have an exam to do.
What about me education program?

534
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,315
Hey, Chiswick!
I've got a one-on-one tomorrow!

535
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,123
You just lost it.

536
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,695
Where's my rubber dolly?!

537
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,706
Hey?!

538
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,334
I need to know
his family history,

539
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,107
his entire prison records,
and his medical records.

540
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,307
At all costs,
whoever who is negotiating

541
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,659
with the perpetrator at Barfield

542
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,084
must in no way
give in to his demands.

543
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,848
Could you hold on a second?

544
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,149
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,020
<i>At Barfield Prison,</i>

546
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,525
<i>and we hope and we pray for...</i>

547
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,822
Does Governor Keller know

548
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,454
that there is a live broadcast
going on?

549
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,624
- I'm not sure.
- I've just heard it.

550
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:18,103
<i>âª Whisper secrets to the wind âª</i>

551
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,140
<i>âª Through âª</i>

552
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,641

553
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,702
<i>âª It's over âª</i>

554
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,075
And if you could let them
have that straightaway, please.

555
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,948
Governor.
Miss Hewitt.

556
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,378
Thanks.
You can leave us.

557
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,449
Nice to see you again.

558
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,120
HQ have supplied me
with the background details,

559
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,028
but I'll need to see
George Falla's report.

560
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,595
Good heavens.

561
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,466
What an improvement.

562
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,498
Very impressive.

563
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,740
How's Morgan coping?

564
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,612
He is
a very experienced officer.

565
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,651
But then, you know him.

566
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,481
He was here when you, um...

567
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,283
Did my caretaking job.

568
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,354
Yes.

569
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,890
Yes.

570
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,694
He was also taken hostage
by a prisoner Norman Jones.

571
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,232
So he'll know the routine.

572
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,299
He's held in the healthcare
center, Miss Hewitt.

573
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,139
In this cell here.

574
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,448
Falla says,
but we can't be sure,

575
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,111
that the door is rigged
to hang Morgan if opened.

576
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,744
Mm.

577
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,880
Well, the door opens inwards,

578
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,152
but we'll have to
take his word for it.

579
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,826
Where on earth did he find
a possible half of a mop?

580
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,831
The mop was left in the cell.

581
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,345
Yeah, we're really
short-staffed after...

582
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,497
Does Falla have a radio
in his cell?

583
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,733
I beg your pardon?

584
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,869
Well, you know they're talking
about the hostage on-air?

585
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,207
What?

586
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,449
Nobody knows
about this situation,

587
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,859
with it being
in the healthcare center.

588
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,943
Well, they obviously do.

589
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,284
The last thing we need
is the local radio wide boy

590
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:20,520
making a meal of it,
so I suggest you contact them.

591
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,118
If you're ready,
you should go down.

592
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,664
They'll need a break.

593
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,360
Oh, no, I, um...
I won't interact with Falla.

594
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,835
I'll just give my advice on how
to handle the perpetrator.

595
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,575
He wants a blow-up rubber doll.

596
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,635
Mm-hmm.
And to see you blowing it up.

597
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,578
Well, let's see what I can do,
shall we?

598
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,550
After you, Miss Hewitt.

599
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,381
Yes, you were.

600
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,444
After me.

601
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,066
Miss Helen Hewitt.
This is, uh, HOC.

602
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,000
- Gary Marshall.
- Miss Hewitt.

603
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,197
Uh, give us five minutes, lads.

604
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,673
He's been in there since 9:00
this morning, Miss Hewitt.

605
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,921
Do you think we ought to, uh...

606
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,156
I'm here
to do the thinking, Gary.

607
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,580
You shouldn't even be here.

608
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,708
I'm not on duty.

609
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,083
- How's Morgan?
- He's taken the gag off him.

610
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,587
<i>Why don't you piss off?!</i>

611
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,815
Is the doctor the main person

612
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,357
that Falla's
been interacting with?

613
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,756
He was.

614
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,952
But he's exhausted,

615
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,018
and the prison negotiator
didn't do too well.

616
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,189
And then Falla
became hysterical,

617
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,892
said he was being poisoned,

618
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,366
and Governor Keller
let Jackson have a go.

619
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,267
Have a go?

620
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,882
Can you get Russell out of there
or not?

621
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,636
That's what I'm here for.

622
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,835
Bloody marvelous.

623
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,208
Look, Gary, you obviously
find this very hard to take,

624
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,940
but you have got to trust me.

625
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,606
<i>Come on, George.</i>

626
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,379
<i>You need treatment
to take your pain away.</i>

627
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,546
And I suggest
you get Officer Jackson

628
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,590
away from the perpetrator <i>now.</i>

629
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,456
<i>One minute you say you're not
gonna hurt Officer Morgan,</i>

630
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,324
<i>and the next you say
you're gonna kill him.</i>

631
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,331
Well, how do you think
that makes us feel, eh?

632
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,390
Eh?

633
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,329
Do you know what you're doing?

634
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,840
Yes, I do.

635
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,876
I'm gonna have to use you, Gary.

636
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,674
If you and HQ will agree to it.

637
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,806
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

638
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,213
I will not die in agony.

639
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,152
No way.

640
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,421
I'd rather be shot.
I am not going through it.

641
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,121
Give in, George.

642
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,827
You need help
to take the pain away.

643
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,427
<i>Right now as
we speak, in Barfield Prison,</i>

644
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,406
<i>a senior officer is being
held hostage at knifepoint.</i>

645
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,965
<i>Mad, bad,
and dangerous prisoner.</i>

646
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,171
<i>For the second time tonight.
This is for you.</i>

647
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:58,115
<i>âª It's over âª</i>

648
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,116
<i>âª It's over âª</i>

649
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,050
It's a sign.

650
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,850
That is a sign!

651
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,324
It's over!
It's all over!

652
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,122
<i>âª It's over âª</i>

653
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,662
Is it?!

654
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,693
You listen to me!

655
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:21,172
I am asking you to not make
a further broadcast.

656
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,174
No, I do not want to go on-air.

657
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,541
What I want is your cooperation.

658
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,576
There is a man's life at risk.

659
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,710
Do you understand that?

660
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,754
Thank you.

661
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,347
Bloody radio station.

662
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,667
Give me the okay
when Marshall's wired.

663
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,422
All right, everybody,
this is Miss Helen Hewitt,

664
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,360
who will be the negotiator.

665
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,624
Hello.

666
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,765
Yeah?

667
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,962
Gary?

668
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,962
Gary? Hi.

669
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,304
<i>Stand by.
Game commences.</i>

670
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,366
George, turn the radio off

671
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,742
and listen to what
I've got to tell you.

672
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,646
<i>âª It breaks your heart... âª</i>

673
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,684
We've got
the medical reports here

674
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,946
from the tests you had done
at your last prison.

675
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,352
I've got cancer.

676
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,856
No, you haven't.

677
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,516
<i>With the right treatment,</i>

678
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,652
<i>you'll be fit and well
within a couple of weeks.</i>

679
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,320
Really play this one, Gary.

680
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,887
Tell him no way has he got
the same thing as his father.

681
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:20,694
Keep him steady.

682
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,099
<i>He does not have
the same disease as his father.</i>

683
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,003
George, it's not hereditary.

684
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,469
<i>Look, you don't have the same
disease as your father.</i>

685
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,572
<i>Your father
had a-a terminal illness.</i>

686
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,140
<i>You've not got the same thing.</i>

687
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,810
<i>You have not got cancer.</i>

688
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,988
<i>Sorry I can't give you
a break, Gary.</i>

689
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,356
<i>You've got to keep him talking,</i>

690
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,089
<i>and we've not heard anything
from Russell.</i>

691
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,188
<i>Let him see
that you're still there.</i>

692
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,291
<i>We have a long way to go.</i>

693
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,496
What do you know about my dad?

694
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,937
What was that, George?

695
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,137
What do you know about my dad?

696
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,077
Your dad?

697
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,479
He was wrongly diagnosed,
George.

698
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,426
<i>Not in his intestines,
but in his stomach.</i>

699
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,715
He had a tumor, not in his
intestines, in his stomach.

700
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,312
<i>We talked to your mother, and
she didn't want you to know.</i>

701
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,880
We talked to your mum.

702
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,323
She was told,

703
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,370
but she didn't want your dad
to know how ill he was.

704
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,953
<i>Tell him it's not hereditary.</i>

705
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,090
And, George,
it's not hereditary.

706
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,656
<i>We've still had no word
from Russell,</i>

707
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,668
<i>but let's not think the worse.</i>

708
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,013
<i>No, his mother's
very, very worried about him.</i>

709
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,953
She wants to come
and talk to him about it.

710
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,220
We can arrange that for him.
That's no problem.

711
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,285
His mother's name is Stella.

712
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,362
Stella.

713
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,332
Now, use her name as much...
As much as...

714
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,961
Could I please have some quiet?!

715
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,473
Now, Mr. Marshall
is very, very tired.

716
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,305
If I lose concentration,
a man could die in there.

717
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,901
<i>Sorry, Gary.</i>

718
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,145
<i>George...</i>

719
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:21,152
Now, Stella would explain to you
why she didn't want you to know.

720
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,122
We've talked to Stella, and now
Stella will explain it to you.

721
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,093
You were young, you were scared.
She protected you.

722
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,958
Heavy on the protect, Gary.

723
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,793
She thought you were special.

724
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,324
George, your mother,
she... she wanted to...

725
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,166
She didn't want to frighten you.
She wanted to protect you.

726
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,002
Now she's very upset
about this situation.

727
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,508
<i>We can get her to talk
all this over with you, George,</i>

728
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,239
<i>but you've got to agree
to releasing Mr. Morgan.</i>

729
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,676
George?

730
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,678
Speak to me, George.
Come on.

731
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,114
<i>George?
To releasing Mr. Morgan.</i>

732
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,682
<i>George,
it makes sense, doesn't it?</i>

733
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,712
Are you still there,
Mr. Marshall?

734
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,136
Yeah, I'm here, George.

735
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,715
- Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here, George.

736
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,817
<i>Tell him the prisoner
he thought was poisoning him...</i>

737
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,676
That prisoner that you thought
was poisoning you...

738
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,772
We've had his cell stripped,
and we couldn't find anything.

739
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,159
<i>He would not have done that
to you.</i>

740
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,518
He swears that, uh, he never
put anything in your food.

741
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,387
He says he wouldn't do that
to you.

742
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,757
<i>We want to make sure that you
have the right treatment.</i>

743
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,592
Tea, two sugars.

744
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,325
<i>I wouldn't mind a cup myself.</i>

745
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,333
We're only trying
to help you, George.

746
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,767
We want you
to get the right treatment,

747
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,202
so that it proves that what

748
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,263
we've been trying to tell you
is the truth.

749
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,543
Tell him that it makes sense.

750
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,475
It all makes sense, George.

751
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,472
Come on, there's a good boy.

752
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,444
<i>I'm getting very tired.</i>

753
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,715
Gary, give him five minutes
to think about it.

754
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,019
You drink your tea.
I need a pee.

755
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:09,357
Okay.
Excuse me.

756
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,643
Gary?

757
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,742
<i>- Okay.</i>
- You okay to start again?

758
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:41,191
<i>You're doing really well, Gary,
so just hang in there.</i>

759
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,755
Don't take that literally.

760
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,321
Do you think that's true?

761
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,525
What was that, George?

762
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,592
About my mother.

763
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,134
About Stella.

764
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,343
Do you?!

765
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,344
Well...

766
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,521
You were only young.

767
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,083
Makes sense
not wanting to scare you.

768
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,828
Nobody wants
their dad to die, George.

769
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,402
Do you think I'll be okay?

770
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,174
All I needed...

771
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,783
was for somebody
to explain all this to me.

772
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,382
This is what
I've been asking for!

773
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,560
Shit.

774
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,471
What are they gonna do to me?

775
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,568
Oh, you can trust Gary.

776
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,171
Mr. Marshall.

777
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,617
You can trust him, George.

778
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,850
You still there, Gary?!

779
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,486
Yeah, I'm here.

780
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,157
- Mr. Marshall!
- Yes, I'm here, George.

781
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,700
What will they do to me
if I come out?

782
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,136
<i>Keep him steady, Gary.</i>

783
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,468
<i>Ask him what he wants</i>

784
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,771
if he comes out, and if it's
a bloody rubber dolly,

785
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,037
we're back to square one.

786
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,950
Did you hear me?!

787
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,453
What'll they do to me
if I come out?

788
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,989
Now he's on the line,
so reel him in gently.

789
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,319
Don't unnerve him.

790
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,725
<i>He's worried about what's gonna
happen to him if he comes out,</i>

791
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,992
so, nice, lots of flannel.

792
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,673
<i>We know he didn't
hurt Officer Morgan,</i>

793
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,407
<i>and he's a sick man.</i>

794
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,915
<i>Everything's going to be taken
into consideration.</i>

795
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,510
- George, are you there?
<i>- We know he's not a well man.</i>

796
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,953
George, look,
you're not a well man.

797
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,614
But until this problem
come along,

798
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,217
you were a good prisoner,

799
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,423
and all this will be
taken into consideration.

800
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,625
All right,
you're gonna go on report,

801
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:38,363
but you haven't hurt
Officer Morgan.

802
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,736
In fact you took care of him,
didn't you?

803
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,537
- Mm?
- Yeah.

804
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,373
Even gave him some

805
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,709
Of course you did.

806
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,146
So really all this...

807
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,013
All this was, was a protest,
right, George?

808
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,646
That's... That's exactly
what this is about, Gary.

809
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,121
<i>That's right.</i>

810
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,385
You come out.
I'll be here.

811
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,558
I'll tell you what, George.

812
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,796
If you come out, I'll make sure
it'll just be me here.

813
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,496
Unless you want to name
anyone else.

814
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,562
No.

815
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,198
Just you, Gary.

816
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,200
Just you and the doc.

817
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,939
Okay, George.

818
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,523
Just me and the doctor
will be out here.

819
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,106
Get the doctor on standby.

820
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,542
This is gonna take
a couple of minutes to arrange.

821
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,847
All right?

822
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,116
- Doctor?
- Mm?

823
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,924
Wake up.
You've been ordered on standby.

824
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,965
Okay.

825
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,626
- Want a cup of tea?
- No, no, I'm all right.

826
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,362
Keep everybody back, Gary.

827
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,028
Don't let him see
any other officers.

828
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,006
<i>I think we have
the end game in sight.</i>

829
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,975
George?

830
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,012
<i>- George, are you there?
- Yeah.</i>

831
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,912
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

832
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:00,110
When it's safe for me to open
this door,

833
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,311
I'm gonna unlock it,

834
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:04,720
and I'm gonna let you come out
when you're ready.

835
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,156
But you've got to let me know
when it's safe.

836
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,352
All right?

837
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,657
<i>Yeah.</i>

838
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,498
<i>Gary?</i>

839
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,765
<i>Yeah?</i>

840
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,603
<i>- It's safe, is it?
- Yeah, unlock the door.</i>

841
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,008
Good boy.

842
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,112
Come out
whenever you're ready, George.

843
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,416
When you're ready, George.

844
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,640
Come on, George.

845
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,142
It's only me and the doc,
like I said.

846
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,408
Come on, son.

847
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,317
He's out.
Is... Is he out, Gary?

848
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,051
<i>Come on, son.</i>

849
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,719
<i>George, come on.</i>

850
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,695
<i>We've sorted all this out now,
haven't we?</i>

851
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,732
I haven't let you down yet.

852
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,529
Told you the truth
all the way through.

853
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,536
There's a good chap.
Come on.

854
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:28,770
You'll look after me?

855
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,810
<i>Guaranteed, George.</i>

856
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:36,109
<i>I'll personally see to it that
you get to discuss all this</i>

857
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,513
with the governor himself.

858
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,552
Can't be fairer than that, son.

859
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,717
Come on.

860
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,485
Nobody here, look.

861
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,219
Just the doctor and me.

862
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,817
Hmm?

863
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,163
Was I telling the truth or not?
Look.

864
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,835
Have a look.
No one here.

865
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,428
Doctor and me.

866
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,807
It's only him and me.
Come on, George.

867
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,870
<i>You're there now, look.</i>

868
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,743
<i>You've done it.</i>

869
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,151
Come on.

870
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,483
There's a good fella.
Come on.

871
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:17,554
That's it now.

872
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,732
We'll go and see the governor

873
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,351
and get all this
straightened out and finished.

874
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,326
Just put your hands out, George,

875
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:27,889
so it can be seen that we've
done this all by the book, yeah?

876
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,400
You know the routine, you know?

877
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,762
Come on.

878
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,403
Arms out.

879
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,978
We need him well clear
of the cell

880
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,639
before anybody moves in on him.

881
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,510
Good lad.

882
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,486
There's a good lad.

883
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,515
All right?

884
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,526
It was... It was just a protest.
That's all it was, Gary.

885
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:56,959
I know that, George.
Come on.

886
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,519
It's all right now, mate.

887
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:01,065
- Yes.
- Yes!

888
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,624
End game.
Well done, Gary.

889
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,844
Take in the counselors
and the care team.

890
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,381
Russell.
Come on.

891
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,144
Look at me, son.

892
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,449
Hey.
It's Gary.

893
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,751
Open your eyes.
Hey.

894
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,383
Good lad.

895
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,019
Can you stand?

896
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,622
Try it.
Come on.

897
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,202
Try it for me.
Come on.

898
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,266
Mm?

899
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,209
Would you like to see
the doctor now, Mr. Morgan?

900
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,351
No.
Um, I don't know.

901
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,949
I'm just a bit stiff.

902
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,357
I know.

903
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,555
W-Was that?

904
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,862
Yes, it was.

905
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,959
Come on.

906
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:13,027
We've got to get you up, son.

907
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,104
Come on.

908
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,834
I could do with a stiff drink.

909
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,102
That's the both of us.

910
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,340
My God,
you took your bloody time.

911
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:25,042
Come on.

912
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,086
Got worried about lunchtime.

913
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,554
Easy. Easy.

914
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,897
Did you call Nora?

915
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,163
- Yeah.
- Oh, she'll have been worried.

916
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,397
Done it.

917
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,133
Why don't I call the doc,

918
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,384
let him give you
and quick look-over?

919
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:54,140
I don't want a bloody doctor.

920
00:46:56,714 --> 00:47:00,048
But if I don't take a leak,

921
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,554
I will have a burst bladder.

922
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:08,421
Come on, then.
We'll go together.

923
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,721
Come on.

924
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,759
Give me a hand, eh?

925
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,665
- Ready?
- Mm.

926
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,034
Come on, then.

927
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,538
Get up here.

928
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,872
Easy.

929
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:25,942
You all right?

930
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,103
Aye.

931
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,406
Come on, then.

932
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,385
You can do it.

933
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,449
Hold it a minute.

934
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,016
Wait there.

935
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,262
Here.
Put that 'round you.

936
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,136
Go on.
You're on your own.

937
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,373
Easy.

938
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,074
I'm with you, Russell.

939
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,481
I'm right behind you.

940
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:16,793
Thanks.

941
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,559
Thanks, everybody.

942
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,592
I'm gonna have to
go to the toilet.

943
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,633
It's been a long day.

944
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,774
Gary!

945
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:40,644
Yes, Miss Hewitt.

946
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:42,983
You were very, very good.
Congratulations.

947
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,316
Thanks.

948
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,380
You should take a few days off.

949
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,449
Negotiations really
take it out of you,

950
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:50,437
especially when you've been
in on it from the start.

951
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,555
You work in the training college
full-time now?

952
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,563
Yeah.

953
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,465
When you left the debriefing,

954
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,732
there was a lot of bad feeling
about how things were run today.

955
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,500
Some of us have got grave doubts

956
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,564
at how Keller
handled the situation.

957
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,304
Barfield could be up for grabs.

958
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,278
Oof.

959
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,338
A lot of water under the bridge
since I was here, Gary.

960
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:16,278
I don't know
whether I'd want to come back.

961
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,754
Besides, I doubt
they'd even have me.

962
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,284
Good night.

963
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,350
Good night, Miss Hewitt.

963
00:49:24,305 --> 00:50:24,280
