00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,843
How much do you know

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,589
about your husband, Gu Jingi?

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,761
What do you mean?

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,346
What will you do
if your husband, Gu Jingi, killed

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,563
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong's brother,

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:22,692
took out his heart, and used it
to do an illegal heart transplant?

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,278
What?

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,397
I told you to stay away from nonsense.

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,161
My father wouldn't do that.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,029
He's right. That's impossible.

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,197
It's true.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,115
Chief Cho Junghyun told us everything.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,589
She said the chairman took out the heart
from Geum Seokju.

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,709
And he also gave me an order
to fabricate the autopsy report.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,721
Yoonjung.

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,969
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner.

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,643
Are you saying he really killed a patient?

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,730
Mother, are you all right?

20
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,903
I'm fine.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,070
I'm fine,

22
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,533
so tell me.

23
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,988
Why are you suddenly here
telling me all this?

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,702
Help us find Mr. Cheon.

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,116
Then we'll keep Banseok University
Medical Center safe from Jayden.

26
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,615
How can you?

27
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,086
Before I tell you how,
please let those two

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,922
leave the room.

29
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,836
Make Ms. Pyo leave? Why?

30
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,844
She blackmailed Park Kitae,

31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,966
fabricated Gil Soyeon's medical record,

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,853
and instigated
Nam Hyukchul's false witness.

33
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,638
It was all done by her

34
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,805
under Gu Jingi's order.

35
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,851
Do you have evidence?

36
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,151
Ma'am, it's not true.
I just did my best for the hospitalâ¦

37
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,283
Leave the room.

38
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,781
Ma'am.

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,530
I told you to leave.

40
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,696
I understand.

43
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,431
What are they going to say?

44
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,313
I'm going to take Honours Hand
from Jayden.

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,733
Every piece of power he has
comes from Honours Hand.

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,110
Take it away? How?

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,990
I'll expose that Jayden received
an illegal organ transplant.

48
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,991
Illegal organ harvesting is

49
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,202
a serious crime
that can result in capital punishment.

50
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,913
If Jayden conspired with Gu Jingi

51
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,035
and killed a patient
to take out his heart,

52
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,793
Honours Hand won't condone it.

53
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,167
If that's exposed, my fatherâ¦

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,090
Make your choice.

55
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,842
Will you protect your husband
or save Banseok University Medical Center?

56
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,969
If you pursue both, you'll lose both.

57
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,975
<i>It's me, Pyo Eunsil.</i>

58
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,907
Han Yihan and Geum Seokyeong are
at Chairman Gu Jingi's home.

59
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,492
<i>They said they came to tell his wife
that thing from five years ago.</i>

60
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,374
Did you take care of Cho Junghyun?

61
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,001
<i>Don't let the police find
even a piece of her hair.</i>

62
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,995
<i>We have no time to lose.</i>

63
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,423
It'll be too late if Mr. Cheon runs off
after killing Cho Junghyun.

64
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,003
What do you mean?

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,587
Why would he kill Cho Junghyun?

66
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,922
Cho Junghyun

67
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,428
went missing at her place yesterday.

68
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,599
Her son, Nam Junhwan,
was left behind unconscious.

69
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,429
Mr. Cheon abducted her.

70
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,024
You already knew

71
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,138
that he had been carrying out
all kinds of dirty deeds

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,558
your father asked him to.

73
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,567
If you don't trust us,
you can hear it yourself.

74
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,150
Hear it myself? From whom?

75
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,320
Come on in.

76
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,540
<i>I got home with my mom.</i>

77
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,709
As soon as we entered the room,
he covered my mouth

78
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,369
and put a syringe on my neck.

79
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,294
I heard it clearly.

80
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,298
My mom begged him to let me go,
but the guy who had me said,

81
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,045
"The chairman doesn't want
any loose ends."

82
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,097
Please make sure you keep him safe.
We never know.

83
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,886
Yes, he'll be safe with me.

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,479
Let's go.

85
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,777
We must locate Mr. Cheon
as soon as possible.

86
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,445
If we let this go on,
Cho Junghyun will alsoâ¦

87
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,445
Do you want Gu Jingi
to kill Cho Junghyun too?

88
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,577
If you're his family,

89
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,957
stop him before this becomes more serious.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,170
But how?

91
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,460
Let's call the secretaries

92
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,665
and the Security Team.

93
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,014
They both report to Mr. Cheon,

94
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,509
so they might know something.

95
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,011
We can use

96
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,350
even the smallest lead right now.

97
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,059
Keep a close eye on Pyo Eunsil
from now on.

98
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,939
If Mr. Cheon wants
to reach out to Gu Jingi,

99
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,265
he must get through Pyo Eunsil.

100
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,294
Did you have to do it like this?

101
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,129
You could've told me.

102
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,088
-You knew my mother would be shocked.
-You already knew too.

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,050
You were at the penthouse too.

104
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,512
Back thenâ¦

105
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,053
Back then, I was out of it.

106
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,676
Sure.

107
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,965
It must've come as a big shock.

108
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,517
You probably never imagined
your father illegally transplanted

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,022
somebody else's organ.

110
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,356
If you wish to do him good,
then find where Mr. Cheon is

111
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,065
before Cho Junghyun dies.

112
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,502
No one is truly trustworthy.

113
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,665
Did you betray us too?

114
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,746
Why? Since she betrayed you,

115
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,552
will you kill her too?

116
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,339
Never mind.

117
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,013
You'll abduct her,
confine her, assault her,

118
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,762
then blackmail her.

119
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,894
You've committed all kinds of crimes,
so you can't back out.

120
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,392
But if you won't back out,
you'll go down with Gu Jingi.

121
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,555
You must be anxious.

122
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,024
I just did my job as an attorney.

123
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,225
Sure.

124
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,574
I hope you do your job
during the trial tomorrow.

125
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,903
It wasn't too fun
when you admitted too quickly.

126
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,698
I want to put an end

127
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,570
to Gu Jingi in court.

128

THE DAY OF GU JINGI'S TRIAL

130
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:08,892
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO A PERSONAL MATTER

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,010
<i>You're Han Yihan?</i>

132
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,013
I heard about you.

133
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,348
You played a decisive role

134
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,314
in bringing down Banseok with Jayden.

135
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,398
Let me introduce myself.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm the Chief Director
of Honours Hand headquarters, Susie Yoon.

137
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,573
Nice to meet you.

138
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,566
I'm Lawyer Han Yihan.

139
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,575
Please excuse me. This is important.

140
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,999
Please have a seat.

141
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,081
Speak.

142
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,624
I found Mr. Cheon.

143
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,496
He'll turn in the burner phone
to the Security Team at 2:30 p.m.

144
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,035
and turn himself in to the police.

145
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,498
At 2:30 p.m.?

146
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,917
That's half an hour from now.

147
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,007
What should I do?

148
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,802
Let me know where they're meeting.

149
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,431
If he runs away,
keep a moderate distance and tail him.

150
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,771
Don't catch him.

151
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,179
Don't catch him? Why not?

152
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,889
We should make him talk.

153
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,147
Even if he gets caught,
will he spill everything that easily?

154
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,402
We must save him instead of catching him.

155
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,942
That way, he'll trust us.

156
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,485
Okay.

157
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,081
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,001
It seems urgent. You should go.

159
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,420
I'll hear the rest from them.

160
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,749
Thank you.

161
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,389
Over there!

162
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,025
Get in. I don't think
you have any time to think.

163
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,832
Don't look at me like that.
I'm here to save you.

164
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,839
You? Save me?

165
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,929
-Why?
-I want to quit seeing these people.

166
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,390
People who get blamed
for other people's crimes

167
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,846
when they have enough on their hands.

168
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,266
What?

169
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:29,396
Gu Jingi put every charge on you.

170
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,816
Do you get it now?

171
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,324
If you gave them the phone
and turned yourself in,

172
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,622
you would've become a murderer.

173
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,209
Cho Junghyun better be alive.

174
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,749
That's how you'll save yourself.

175
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,037
Where is

176
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,549
Cho Junghyun?

177
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,801
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

178
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,806
Counsel. What is this?

179
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,153
What is this noise?

180
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,898
Suddenlyâ¦

181
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,566
Counsel.

182
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,656
Is this phone you have in your hand yours?

183
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,959
Your Honor. Prosecution has confirmed
circumstances that suggest this cellphone

184
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,253
possessed by the defendant's counsel
is important evidence in this case.

185
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,838
Please consent to check it.

186
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,342
What are you doing? Let go.

187
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,684
Prosecution. What do you mean?

188
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,890
How is it evidence?

189
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,267
DEFENDANT

190
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,571
Who is it?

191
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,068
<i>It's Cheon Hyungu.</i>

192
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,579
Where are you?

193
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,661
<i>I'm at the courthouse.</i>

194
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,751
Mr. Cheon Hyungu?

195
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,463
Yes, that's right.

196
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,958
Prosecution, what is going on?

197
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,622
Cho Junghyun, Cheon Hyungu.

198
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,828
Were you planning on killing them both?

199
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,417
Did you say you were sick of this?

200
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,205
I'm sick of it too,

201
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,092
so I'll reveal everything

202
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,511
right here, right now.

203
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,282
Your Honor,
I am sorry to interrupt the trial.

204
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,989
I am Attorney Han Yihan,
representing Cheon Hyungu, the accomplice

205
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,410
and the witness, Cho Junghyun.

206
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,164
My client wanted
to turn himself in to the police today,

207
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,367
but the Security Team
of Banseok attacked him

208
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,128
and made an attempt
to destroy the evidence.

209
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,633
Evidence? What evidence?

210
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,852
This phone has the record
of every single crime

211
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,642
which the defendant has ordered
my client for years.

212
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:49,329
Your Honor, I would like to call
Cheon Hyungu to the stand.

213
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,171
Impossible. We did not agree
on having Mr. Cheon Hyungu.

214
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,459
He's a wanted criminal at the moment.

215
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,923
We must send him to the police
and have him questioned.

216
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,008
I couldn't make a request beforehand
because he was wanted by the police.

217
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,051
The attorney has previously stated that

218
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,724
Cheon Hyungu is the real culprit
who killed Lee Dohyung,

219
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,854
so we must confirm the truth
with Cheon Hyungu himself.

220
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,896
We must reach an agreement.

221
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,944
We'll adjourn for 20 minutes,

222
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,447
then decide if Mr. Cheon will be
allowed to witness without summons.

223
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,533
All rise.

224
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,225
"Attorney Han appeared in court
during the trial

225
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,812
and stated there's evidence that supports

226
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,438
Gu Jingi's charges

227
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,074
in the phone used by Mr. Cheon,

228
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,072
Gu Jingi's accomplice."

229
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,281
Isn't this dangerous?

230
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,462
You said we had to go somewhere together.
Is this it?

231
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,046
Yes.

232
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,719
Five years ago, I got into an accident

233
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,264
because Gu Jingi deceived me.

234
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,687
What are you doing? That was dangerous.

235
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,790
<i>It has been a while, Boss.</i>

236
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,753
No, you aren't my boss any more. Jayden.

237
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,921
You told Han Yihan about me.

238
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,004
<i>What can I do? I needed to save myself.</i>

239
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,548
So should we meet right now?

240
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,299
My new boss wants to talk to you.

241
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,715
Fine. Come to my penthouse right now.

242
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,849
Witness.
Around 10 a.m. on March 23rd, 2022,

243
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,225
you met Assistant Director Lee Dohyung
with Gu Jingi, the defendant.

244
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,613
-Yes.
-In the video of the said day,

245
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,072
the defendant gave you an order

246
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,412
to take care of the victim, Lee Dohyung,
within Banseokwon.

247
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,659
Let me ask.

248
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,197
Witness, did you kill the victim?

249
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,043
I saidâ¦

250
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,955
we should let him live.

251
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,047
It was a hospital, so he could have lived
if we moved him and treated him.

252
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,135
However,

253
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,930
Chairman Gu stopped me.

254
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,728
<i>Do you know what I regret the most?</i>

255
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,023
<i>Five years ago in the detention center,
letting Han Yihan go alive.</i>

256
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,193
-What's he saying?
-Han Yihan? That lawyer?

257
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,488
-Letting him live?
-What did he do?

258
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,452
"Five years ago in the detention center,
letting Han Yihan go alive."

259
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,080
What does this mean?

260
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,247
Your Honor, what happened
five years ago is unrelated to this--

261
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,790
No, it's a part of the evidence,
so we'll hear from him.

262
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,417
Five years ago,
Chairman Gu gave me an order

263
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,100
to instigate Gong Gukkwang and assault
Lawyer Han Yihan in the detention center.

264
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,141
And on the night of the assault,
he visited Mr. Han Yihan

265
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,935
and told him that he'd die there

266
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,863
unless he admitted to the malpractice
he had committed against Geum Seokju.

267
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,034
Did he make you abduct Cho Junghyun too?

268
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,409
Yes, he told me to abduct her, kill her,

269
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,700
then hide her body.

270
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,792
Why didn't you do as he said?

271
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,001
Because I knew I've been betrayed

272
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,129
thanks to Mr. Han Yihan.

273
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,553
Do you have evidence
to back up your statements?

274
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,969
On the phone we just spoke,

275
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,179
you'll find every single order
I got from him for the last five years.

276
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,233
I'll confirm the contents of his phone

277
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,098
and turn it in as evidence for this trial.

278
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,346
That's all.

279
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,728
Counsel, would you like to question him?

280
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,405
No, I will not.

281
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,952
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Cho Junghyun to the stand.

282
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,583
Ms. Cho.

283
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,910
-Yes.
-Can you bear witness?

284
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,623
I can.

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,375
I understand. Please get ready.

286
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,429
Not bad.

287
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,182
I guess Banseok adored you

288
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,017
without knowing you'll betray them.

289
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,854
Are you complaining about bringing
the biggest benefit to Honours Hand?

290
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,613
Also,

291
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,859
I think you're the one
who came to stab me in the back.

292
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,242
Stab you in the back?

293
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,114
As the Chief Director of the headquarters,

294
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,026
I came to inspect you,
the head of the Asian branch.

295
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,617
I came to verify the report
that you received

296
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,543
illegal heart transplant surgery
in return for our investment.

297
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,634
You heard such nonsense and came this far?

298
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,586
I guess the chief director

299
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,970
doesn't have much to do.

300
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,219
We'll find out soon
if this was nonsense or not.

301
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,546
Han Yihan said

302
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,024
he'll reveal everything
between you and Gu Jingi on trial today.

303
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,980
If it is true, I can just go back,

304
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,358
but what about you?
That'll be the end of you.

305
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,493
Witness, in the morning
of November 21st, 2016,

306
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,946
did you take part
in the heart transplant surgery

307
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,918
along with the defendant,
Gu Jingi, at Banseokwon?

308
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,585
Yes, I did.

309
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,759
The heart he used
during the transplant surgery.

310
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,722
Who did it belong to?

311
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,007
It was the heart of Geum Seokju.

312
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,895
Whoâ¦

313
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,743
Who took outâ¦

314
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,485
the heart?

315
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,831
Chairman Gu Jingi did.

316
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,129
And I helped him.

317
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,305
You're going to put him on ECMO?

318
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,852
He's recovering well. Why?

319
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,266
Just do as I say.

320
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,560
Don't ask questions.

321
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,228
But this is justâ¦

322
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,317
Don't you want

323
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,698
Junhwan to live?

324
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,737
-Sorry?
-There's this new drug.

325
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,244
It treats hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
by internal treatment.

326
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:31,084
Of course, it's approved by the FDA.

327
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,417
It's rarely used locally.

328
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,250
It costs millions of won per injection.

329
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,342
And it's not covered by insurance.

330
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,802
I'll give it to Junhwan.

331
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,143
And I'll pay for everything.

332
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,350
Although it's on the premise

333
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,144
that you'll help me.

334
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,725
<i>I knew his order wasn't normal,</i>

335
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,981
but I couldn't turn it down.

336
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,356
Back then, I thought

337
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,534
the new drug was going to save my son.

338
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,656
Did Gu Jingi

339
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,366
take out the heart

340
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,458
from the patient himself?

341
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,705
Yes.

342
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,467
Yes, he took the heart out
from Geum Seokju,

343
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,966
put it into the VIP patient's chest,
then sutured him.

344
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,308
After that, Chairman Gu
called Dr. Han Yihan

345
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,111
and had him transplant

346
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,691
Geum Seokju's heart
into the VIP patient's chest.

347
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,450
And the next morning,

348
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,406
the chairman destroyed
the ECMO Geum Seokju was on

349
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,584
and finished his life.

350
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,053
Witness.

351
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,802
You just confessed to your criminal case.

352
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,597
Are you aware of this?

353
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,260
Yes.

354
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,478
I'm going to confess
to all the crimes I committed

355
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,435
and face the punishment.

356
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,562
I see.

357
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,281
Prosecution.
Do you have anything more to add?

358
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,565
Prosecution. Are you okay?

359
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,951
I'm all right.

360
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,409
I'm okay.

361
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,117
Prosecutor Geum.

362
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,705
Seokyeong.

363
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,921
Call an ambulance. Hurry!

364
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,295
Can you hear me?

365
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,842
Seokyeong.

366
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,528
Yes. It just ended.

367
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,533
Gosh. Things got a bit complicated.

368
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,491
<i>Cheon Hyungu and Cho Junghyun testified,
so we were close.</i>

369
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,282
But Prosecutor Geum collapsed,
so the trial was halted.

370
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,526
She collapsed?

371
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,655
I guess things didn't go well?

372
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Okay.

373
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,959
The prosecutor collapsed,
so the trial was halted.

374
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,625
You're lucky.

375
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,922
But it won't change anything.
Things just got delayed. That's all.

376
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,186
We will stop questioning
the witnesses here.

377
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,441
And we will set a date
for the next hearing.

378
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,823
As soon as I hear from the prosecutor,
we'll set a date to continue.

379
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,032
Yes, Your Honor.

380
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,112
All rise.

381
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,533
Chairman Gu.

382
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,084
Good work.

383
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,047
Father.

384
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,175
-Hyunseong.
-Whyâ¦

385
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,550
Why did you do it?

386
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,393
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,975
All I can say to you isâ¦

388
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,018
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,318
My son.

390
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,072
All right. Let's go.

391
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,926
<i>Dilated cardiomyopathy.</i>

392
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,024
<i>I understand that
it's a hereditary disease.</i>

393
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,650
<i>How could she have
the same condition as Seokju?</i>

394
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,935
This is awful.

395
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,152
If something bad were to happen to her,

396
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,201
Yihan wouldâ¦

397
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,858
<i>The price went down
as soon as the market opened.</i>

398
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,032
Gu Jingi's trial yesterday
must have shocked a lot of people.

399
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,032
There were a lot of articles
about you and Honours Hand.

400
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,615
It says how a foreign company was about
to take over Korea's leading bio-company

401
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,702
and how there was a suspicion

402
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,827
of illegal organ harvesting
during the process.

403
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,293
I don't care.

404
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,168
A suspicion is just a suspicion.

405
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm going to leave the country as soon
as I redeem my investment in stocks.

406
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,564
You'll come with me, right?

407
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,639
Of course, I'm coming with you.

408
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,614
I need to get a medical checkup
as an outpatient at Banseokwon.

409
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,533
-A medical checkup?
-There's something I must find.

410
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,569
Tell the medical director
that I want to see him tonight.

411
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,581
What is it?

412
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,041
Han Yihan reported me
to the bar association

413
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,344
for threatening
Park Kitae and Nam Hyukchul

414
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,548
and for conspiring
to change the surgeon without consent

415
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,959
and to fabricate medical records.

416
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,013
I will soon be disbarred.

417
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,718
I don't think I can defend you anymore.

418
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:04,927
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,767
No, I should apologize.

420
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,271
I gave you too big of a burden.

421
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,902
Okay. Just relay my message
to the medical director.

422
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,112
I'll take care of the rest myself.

423
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,284
I'm truly sorry that
I can't represent you to the end.

424
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,413
Ms. Pyo.

425
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,552
Mr. Gu.

426
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,385
You have a visit from a lawyer.

427
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,469
His name is Han Yihan.

428
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,140
Will you turn him away?

429
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,439
-Mr. Han.
-Yes.

430
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,897
Mr. Gu has agreed to your request.

431
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,487
Come with me.

432
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,344
Has it been five years since it had beenâ¦

433
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,392
just the two of us like this?

434
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,934
Why was it Seokju?

435
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,940
If you needed a heart for your investment,

436
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,984
you could have figured out another way.

437
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,977
Why was it me?

438
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,607
I didn't know

439
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,821
when the hospital would get another heart

440
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,494
if not his.

441
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,374
And you, Han Yihan,

442
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,618
were standing my son's way.

443
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,292
I thought
I had to get rid of you for good,

444
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,001
so my son could
no longer be in your shadow.

445
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,463
I believed that I had to remove you

446
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,304
because he was never going to surpass you.

447
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,594
Because of your selfishness,

448
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,345
I lost everything that mattered to me.

449
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,472
My greed

450
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,979
caused everything.

451
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,150
I'm sorry.

452
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,363
I'm asking you for your forgiveness,
but I know it won't be enough.

453
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,447
Despite that,
I want to protect Banseok no matter what.

454
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,582
To stop Jayden from taking over.

455
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,866
I hid a video that proves
that Jayden was the recipient

456
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,627
of Seokju's heart.

457
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,258
Find that video,
stop Jayden from taking over,

458
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,390
and protect Banseok, please.

459
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,507
I'm begging you.

460
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,345
Why are you asking me?

461
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,520
Han Yihan.

462
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,519
You were the only one
who didn't get swallowed in greed.

463
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,601
I'm ashamed to ask you this.

464
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,898
The only person I can trust
is the person I tortured the most.

465
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,492
It's you,

466
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,275
Han Yihan.

467
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,691
Han Yihan came to Banseokwon?

468
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,895
Yes. He went to the VIP floor
with the head of the Security Team.

469
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,745
You'll feel dizzy and enervated.

470
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,420
After I inject the shot, I'll request
to transfer you to Banseokwon.

471
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,508
Okay.

472
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,641
Nights hereâ¦

473
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,691
are quite long.

474
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,186
Nightsâ¦

475
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,747
This contains evidence
that Jayden took the heart?

476
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,793
Yes.

477
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,915
LAWYER HAN YIHAN

478
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,712
I need to check.

479
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,273
Director Jung.

480
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,151
Why are you here?

481
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,782
Did you buy off the medical director too?

482
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,452
It wasn't hard.

483
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,822
Those who once caved into money

484
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:58,197
will cave into a bigger sum of money
next time.

485
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,539
This is what you used

486
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,881
to drug me five years ago.

487
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,264
But the dosage is several times higher.

488
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,383
So this is the end

489
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,893
you wanted all along.

490
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,888
Even if you kill me,
the truth will come out

491
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,096
because I gave Han Yihan the video

492
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,396
that proves you got

493
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,113
Geum Seokju's heart.

494
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,153
Does it look like
I'm doing this to silence you?

495
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,945
No. I'm getting revenge.

496
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,366
Revenge for taking
the most precious thing in my life.

497
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,086
I'll tell you my story now.

498
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,168
Once you hear everything, you will

499
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,589
understand me too.

500
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,506
<i>Why do you suddenly want
to postpone the surgery to tomorrow?</i>

501
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,722
<i>I apologize.
There is someone I need to meet.</i>

502
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,274
<i>Once I get a transplant,
I will need to stay here for a month.</i>

503
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,732
<i>I must meet this person now.</i>

504
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,609
Someone he had to meet?

505
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,896
Was itâ¦

506
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,480
What is it?

507
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,027
I checked Jayden's car accident report
this afternoon.

508
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,453
There was a passenger.

509
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,951
A passenger?

510
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,330
<i>That night,</i>

511
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,746
I left Banseokwon
after taking the drug you gave me

512
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,457
because I got a call
that they had found the person

513
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,755
I wanted to meet in Korea.

514
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,928
<i>You have arrived at your destination.
This is the end of the route guidance.</i>

515
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,751
The passenger was Kim Junghye.

516
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,714
KIM JUNGHYE, FEMALE, 63

517
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,921
She was a 63-year-old woman.

518
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,880
She died.

519
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,224
The fellow passenger in the car died.

520
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,054
I took the heart out myself.

521
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,813
I asked him
how he got the heart that night.

522
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,641
This is what Gu Jingi said.

523
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,646
"The fellow passenger in the car died."

524
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,556
That's how he took out the heart.

525
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,438
Then the heart Jayden received

526
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,356
belonged to this woman, not Geum Seokju?

527
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,445
No. I doubt that.

528
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,820
Given the size and condition of the heart,

529
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,448
it couldn't have belonged
to a woman in her 60s.

530
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,445
Then who is this woman?

531
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,617
KIM JUNGHYE, FEMALE, 63, DEAD

532
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,264
I heard that you were my son's friend.

533
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,640
You're quite handsome.

534
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,927
I wonder
if Jaehyuk would've been handsome too.

535
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,972
Your sonâ¦

536
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,888
Do you want

537
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,114
to meet Jaehyuk?

538
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,189
Of course.

539
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,855
I even missed him in my dreams.

540
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,366
Then why didn't you look for him?

541
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,448
Jaehyukâ¦

542
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,912
really missed you.

543
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,222
I was scared.

544
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,813
I sent him away to such a faraway country

545
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,265
because things got tough for me.

546
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,886
Looking for him after all these years
scared me.

547
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:57,187
I didn't want him to see me like this.
I'm not exactly well-off.

548
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,108
So the possibility of becoming
a burden on him also scared me.

549
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,985
And when I heard

550
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,952
Jaehyuk was looking for me, I was afraid,

551
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,290
but I still thought I had to see him.

552
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,542
I know I can't be forgiven for what I did,

553
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,215
but I wanted to say this to him at least.

554
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,633
Thatâ¦

555
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,757
I wanted to see himâ¦

556
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,095
and missed him too.

557
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,907
I resented you a lotâ¦

558
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,655
because you abandoned me.

559
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,116
Butâ¦

560
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
I still missed you.

561
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,093
Mom.

562
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,835
No way. Are youâ¦

563
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,428
Jaehyuk?

564
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,017
What is it?

565
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,353
What's wrong?

566
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,151
What is it? What's wrong, Jaehyuk?

567
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,035
Jaehyuk. Oh, no.

568
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,168
Jaehyuk. Are you all right?

569
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,339
Jaehyuk!

570
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,466
Don't exert yourself.
You still need to rest.

571
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,691
Where am I?

572
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,690
You're in a VIP room at Banseokwon.

573
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,316
You were in an accident.

574
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
An accident?

575
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,654
But you were very lucky.

576
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,406
You were transported to my hospital
right away and were treated accordingly.

577
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,203
And your heart transplant
was successful too.

578
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,197
I had surgery?

579
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,710
What about the woman in the car?

580
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,053
The one in the passenger seat.

581
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,471
Unfortunately, she met her end.

582
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,933
Ten days have passed since the accident.

583
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,429
Our hospital held a funeral for her.

584
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,354
The passenger didn't have any family.

585
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,733
Did you know the deceased well?

586
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,027
You took away
the most important thing from me

587
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,123
at the moment I had been waiting for.

588
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,907
She was the only family I had left.

589
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,247
You took my mother from me.

590
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,918
Back thenâ¦

591
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,209
Back thenâ¦

592
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,136
-Iâ¦
-I want you to regret and be reminded

593
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,096
of what you did

594
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,403
and die slowly

595
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,111
and painfully.

596
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,950
And that is the end
I had been planning for youâ¦

597
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,624
in the past five years.

598
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,373
Iâ¦

599
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,974
Jayden didn't want

600
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,802
to get the heart transplant that night.

601
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,097
That's why

602
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,183
Gu Jingi caused the accident.

603
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,097
Jayden had to get the heart,

604
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,361
so Honours Hand would invest in Banseok.

605
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,069
It means
Jayden was deceived by Gu Jingi too.

606
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,991
Now, I get why

607
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,738
Jayden was so determined

608
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,283
to get revenge on Gu Jingi.

609
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,996
-That way. Be careful.
-Father.

610
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,586
Let's move him.

611
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,170
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

612
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,221
Get that.

613
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,102
What happened?

614
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,849
How could a healthy man
fall unconscious overnight?

615
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,061
What on earth did you do to him?

616
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,190
I'm sorry.

617
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,440
He told me
he wasn't feeling well last night.

618
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,982
But I don't know what happened.

619
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,315
He's conscious now.

620
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,777
Father. Are you all right?

621
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,986
-Hey. My son.
-Yes?

622
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,624
I'm all right.

623
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,794
He's conscious now.
But it's only temporary.

624
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,083
Shut it, you punk.

625
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,375
Father. Don't worry about anything. Okay?

626
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,339
Iâ¦

627
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,883
-Hyunseong.
-Yes?

628
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,881
I don't have

629
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,180
much time left.

630
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,511
Father.

631
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,600
Get Han Yihan for me.

632
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:49,904
Okay.

633
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,150
I hope she wakes up soon.

634
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,119
What's this about?

635
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,004
My fatherâ¦

636
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,673
He's looking for you.

637
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,548
PATIENT ROOM

638
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,299
Stay with her at all times.

639
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,894
Whatever happens, don't leave her side.

640
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,890
Don't worry. I won't go anywhere.

641
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,532
Hyunseong.

642
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,160
Okay.

643
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,182
Was it Jayden?

644
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,111
Thank you for coming.

645
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,739

April 2nd, 9:24 a.m.

648
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,673
Mr. Gu Jingi passed away.

649
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,632
No!

650
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,876
No.

651
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,891
Why did you suddenly change the time?
We were going to leave in the afternoon.

652
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,225
Something came up at the headquarters.

653
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,943
We were going to leave today anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

654
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,444
Why? Is something on your mind?

655
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,150
No.

656
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,790
Sir, Jayden left the penthouse.

657
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,922
He packed everything up.

658
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,547
And Director Lim Yuna checked out as well.

659
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,750
Han Yihan speaking.

660
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,456
<i>Jayden called
Honours Hand's chartered flight.</i>

661
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,801
When does it leave?

662
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,512
<i>It leaves Incheon International Airport
at 10:30 a.m.</i>

663
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,965
-<i>One hour remains.</i>
-Okay.

664
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,111
Seokyeong, you are awake.
Do you recognize me?

665
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,316
Daewoong.

666
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,282
Lie down. You need to take it easy.

667
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,157
Whatâ¦

668
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,455
What happened?

669
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,328
You lost consciousness at the court
and got transferred to New-Hope.

670
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,206
Thank goodness you regained consciousness.

671
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,924
Where is Yihan?

672
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,415
Well,

673

he went to see Chairman Gu.

674
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,264
Gu Jingi?

675
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,313
GU JINGI, A FORMER MINISTER CANDIDATE
PASSES AWAY

676
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,819
What is it?

677
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,079
Mr. Jayden Lee, it's time to board.

678
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,793
Okay.

679
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,412
Shall we go?

680
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,717
<i>It's Gate 12.</i>

681
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,929
<i>I checked with the captain.</i>

682
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,840
Okay.

683
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,731
What is it?

684
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,939
Before I board the plane,
there is something I want to ask you.

685
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,941
Is our sudden departure related

686
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,527
to Gu Jingi's death?

687
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,454
Jayden!

688
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,076
Hyunseong.

689
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,249
What are you doing?

690
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,509
We need security at Gate 12!

691
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,430
-It's okay. Don't call security.
-Butâ¦

692
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,588
I said it's okay.

693
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,014
Don't interrupt us.

694
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,426
Why? Do you think I killed Gu Jingi?

695
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,308
Yes.

696
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,480
You killed my father.

697
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,443
So, are you going to take revenge?

698
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,319
Will you be able to do it?

699
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,279
Come to me when you are certain.

700
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,540
Even if it takes years,

701
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,749
I will wait for you.

702
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,003
Make sure you take revenge.

703
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,554
Shall we go?

704
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,849
With your life,

705
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,727
pay for my father's life.

706
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,674
Gu Hyunseong, get a grip.
Your father wouldn't want this!

707
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,673
-Please help him. Please.
-Over here.

708
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,006
Please.

Han Yihan.

711

Bring me the first-aid kit. Call 911.

712
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,312
I didn't know

713
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,725
how Gu Jingi

714
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,611
would get the heart.

715
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,783
Don't speak.

716
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,821
The blood shouldn't enter the lungs.

717
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,867
Please tell

718
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,039
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong

00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,504

720
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,996
I want to apologize.

721
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,799
Jayden, wake up.

722
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,603
Jayden!

723

PATIENT TRANSPORTATION

724
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,572
Daewoong, prepare for surgery.

725
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,649
Call Dr. Choi Yosub and Ms. Cho Junghyun.
And get me an anesthesiologist.

726
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,026
<i>What? Why?</i>

727
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,703
Jayden got stabbed in the heart
with a scalpel.

728
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,696
-We don't have much time.
-<i>Okay</i>.

729
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,748
Here.

730
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,955
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

731
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,004
Yosub, let's get the bypass first.

732
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,707
-I will go and get ready.
-Okay.

733
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,550
Yihan, hold on.

734
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,507
Seokyeong regained consciousness.

735
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,361
Yihan.

736
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,198
Seokyeong.

737
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,833
How about Jayden? How is he?

738
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,669
I heard that he got stabbed in the heart.

739
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,285
Tell me which condition he is in.

740
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,843
The blade

741
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,545
reached the heart.

742
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,970
If he doesn't get surgery now,
things will get very dangerous.

743
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,968
The heartâ¦

744
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,401
Yihan, we are ready.

745
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,025
Make sure

746
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,237
Jayden lives.

747
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,200
Make sure he lives

748
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,582
so that he can have a trial

749
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,917
and get punished properly.

750
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,511
That's what we fought for.

751
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,756
Yes.

752
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,812
Patient name, Jayden Lee.

753
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,148
Let's begin the surgery.

754
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,940
-Scalpel.

SURGERY IN PROGRESS

757

Don't be nervous. Breathe in and out.

758
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,838
I will try.

759
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:31,972
Play the music.

760
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,741
Give me the marker.

761
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,858
-Forceps.
-Forceps.

762

Please make a sound.

767
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,783
What? My voice.

768
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,116
Good job.

769
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,580
This time, make a longer sound.

770
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,924
Let's close it up.

771
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,804
Shall we raise her up?

772
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,756
-Okay.
-Okay.

773
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,639
Be careful.

774
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,008
It looks like the surgery went well.

775
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,682
The two of you went through a lot.

who had received a heart transplant

for dilated cardiomyopathy,

809
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,192
Geum Seokju passed away.

810
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,068
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

811

<i>Yihan.</i>

812
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,581
Did the result come out? What happened?

813
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,745
The verdict is not guilty.

814
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,259
-Hey!
-Hey!

815
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,341
Not you.

816
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,391
You did well.

817
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,718
I will go back after I drop by somewhere.

818
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,557
Okay. Don't come back too late.

819
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,018
They are preparing a party.

820
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,149
-Yihan, hurry back!
-Congratulations.

821
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,861
<i>-Hey.
-Hurry back.</i>

822
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,401
-<i>This isn't his first birthday party.</i>
-Okay. See you later.

823
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,844
It has been a while.

HOPEFUL CORRECTIONS

RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

826
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,685
Why didn't you tell me

827
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,654
about your past?

828
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,320
Had you told me from the start,
things wouldn't have gottenâ¦

829
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,613
No.

830
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,872
Still,

831
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,241
the end

832
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,331
would have been the same.

833
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,131
I wanted to be with you guys

834
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,882
for a bit longer.

835
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,632
Those times

836
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,593
were fun.

837
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,641
I relayed a petition for Gu Hyunseong

838
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,476
to the court.

839
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,440
Since the victim
asked for a lighter sentence,

840
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,809
it will be taken into consideration
at the second trial.

841
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,105
I am glad.

842
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,739
Your case also has room for extenuation.

843
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,163
I will defend you,
so why don't you appeal?

844
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,790
No. I won't appeal.

845
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,536
I had revenge in my way.

846
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,868
Now, I am paying the price.

847
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,919
Without avoiding it,

848
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,669
I will carry out the sentence.

849
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,722
Let's say goodbye one last time.

850
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,430
Thank you.

Why did you save me?

855
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,262
I lied to you until the end.

856

Iâ¦ I really don't need this.

861
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,324
Just stay still, Seokyeong.

862
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,528
You shouldn't look haggard
on a day like this.

863
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,820
What do you think? Does she look better?

864
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,454
Yes. Her skin looks dewier.

865
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,451
-Iâ¦
-No. She needs more.

866
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,583
Let's apply more.

867
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,079
I am really okay.

868
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,121
-Put it on her body.
-Yes. Put it on your body.

869
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,542
Seokyeong, I have a hunch.

870
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,205
You might get proposed to today.

871
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,634
Get proposed to?

872
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,592
Think about it.
The bad guys are paying for their crimes.

873
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,553
Yihan got acquitted.

874
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,304
A proposal will make a happy ending.

875
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,982
Gosh, what are you talking about?

876

-Apply it.
-Yes. You never know.

Apply it.

I am sorry. You must have waited long.

What is it that you want to tell me?

880
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,052
Don't be surprised.

881

Seokyeong.

882
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,187
The heart transplant has been decided.
