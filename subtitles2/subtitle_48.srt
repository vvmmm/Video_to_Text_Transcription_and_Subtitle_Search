Lockup!

South Wing!

Lights out, Main Wing.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,974
Get someone in here!

12
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,349
Get them out of there!

13
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:00,032
To counteract this situation,
I would advocate that...

14
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,545
You are, Miss Hewitt, lacking
in actual practical experience.

15
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,807
I see no reason why my age
should be held against me

16
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,373
when applying for
governor rank three.

17
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,816
They've got
the fire under control,

18
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,252
but the media are swarming
around the place like flies.

19
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,654
Three have absconded,
two are still...

20
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,090
- You're not married?
- No, I'm divorced.

21
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,788
And Michael Winchwood
died on his way to the hospital.

22
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,296
Oh, that's all we need.

23
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,799
Do we have any further questions
for Miss Hewitt?

24
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,860
Have you got
any estimation of the damage?

25
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,700
Oh, it's catastrophic.

26
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,231
Three of the four accommodation
wings are virtually demolished.

27
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,437
They've systematically
smashed every bathroom,

28
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,242
plumbing ripped from the walls.

29
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,009
There's water dripping down

30
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,677
and gas cylinders ignited
to fuel the fire.

31
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,515
It's bloody tragic.

32
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,790
Thank you very much,
Miss Hewitt.

33
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,763
Beryl! Beryl!

34
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,233
Beryl!

35
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,244
Ah, well,
we've found a foster home,

36
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,303
so we can't delay it any longer.

37
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,506
Oh, shit.

38
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,846
- Did you tell her?
- What do <i>you</i> think?

39
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,077
She knows it was coming,

40
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,245
and the longer the delay,
the worse it'll be.

41
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,788
Wait, wait.
Beryl.

42
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,551
Wait.

43
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,717
I wanted to be with her
when she was told.

44
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,523
I waited, Helen.

45
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,188
She'll need supervision
for a while.

46
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,755
- Yes!
- Did it go well at HQ?

47
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,860
Right now my prisoners
are displaying all the symptoms

48
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,632
of an endemic drug culture.

49
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,235
When we began to move
the inmates from their cells,

50
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,369
the trouble spread.

51
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,347
It was now 2:00 a.m.

52
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,681
More fires were started,
some inside the cells,

53
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,779
and the prisoners
began their rampage.

54
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,222
By 5:00, it was estimated

55
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,092
that there were
some 400 prisoners involved.

56
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:40,065
By 5:30, the ambulances
had taken all the casualties

57
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,102
to the hospital wing,

58
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,696
and at 10... 10:00...
The riot was under control.

59
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,045
Oh.

60
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,450
- All right?
- Better.

61
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,463
Hello.

62
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,763
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

63
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,463
How you doing?
All right?

64
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,096
Hello, sweetheart.

65
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,238
Don't let them take her.

66
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,609
Come on, Tina. You knew
this was gonna have to happen.

67
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,910
We've been preparing for it.

68
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,049
Tina.

69
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,847
She only knows me.
She's mine.

70
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,380
Of course she is. But it's
upsetting for everybody else.

71
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,894
You're just gonna have to
accept it, I'm afraid.

72
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,395
- Tina.
- I know!

73
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,456
But not yet.

74
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,867
You can't take Karen yet.
I won't let her go.

75
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,871
I have asked for more officers

76
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,498
to deal specifically
with the inflood of drugs.

77
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,908
But you instigated
this personal lockup method,

78
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,310
and the prisoners have keys.

79
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,712
Yes!
Only to their cell!

80
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,182
They couldn't leave the spur.

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,378
Obviously doesn't work.

82
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,019
The press are assuming
that your employees

83
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,186
not only shop for groceries
for the inmates,

84
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,729
but could have
brought the drugs in as well.

85
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,994
You seen <i>The Independent</i>
this morning?

86
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,865
<i>I have had my car vandalized,</i>

87
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,201
<i>I've had my house burgled,</i>

88
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,763
<i>and I have lost my nerve
to go out at night.</i>

89
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,605
<i>And I don't want to hear</i>

90
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,373
<i>that if and when
they find the criminal</i>

91
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,074
<i>who ransacked my home,
that he's living in luxury.</i>

92
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,414
<i>There should be stricter
regimes in all the prisoners.</i>

93
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,216
<i>Â£40 million worth of damage.</i>

94
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,418
<i>I think that those men who
destroyed Barfield Prison...</i>

95
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,257
- You off then, Gov?
- We've had to segregate Tina.

96
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,229
She's causing problems.

97
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,855
Pity Mona wouldn't help out.

98
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,851
I don't think it would have
been any good anyway.

99
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,529
This riot's causing a storm.

100
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,072
- Can I have a word?
- Mm?

101
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,903
Wasn't very convenient,
your taking the morning off,

102
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,774
especially with
the Tina situation.

103
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,541
In the future,
give me more warning.

104
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,207
Keep your eye on her.

105
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,513
See you tomorrow.
Good night.

106
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,745
Good night, then.

107
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,913
- Good night, Governor.
- Good night, Governor.

108
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,656
I told her I was going days ago.

109
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,856
We got hold of balloons.
Do you want to see what we got?

110
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,660
- What are you talking about?
- For Beryl.

111
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,510
- She's getting married Saturday.
- Oh. Oh, yes.

112
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,503
The hen party's Thursday night.

113
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,201
She's got a second
honors degree, in psychology.

114
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,608
Played a substantial part
in suicide awareness support.

115
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,839
We'll all be needing
more than support.

116
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,942
Mm.
Excellent result from the field.

117
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,216
Well, she is very accomplished.

118
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,553
She's not married.
Very dedicated.

119
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,558
She's still very young.

120
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,218
Even so,
she spent two years in the U.S.

121
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,354
studying their penal system.

122
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,227
No, I think she is
a very good candidate

123
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,233
to put on
the investigation team.

124
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,828
Mm.
Good to have one woman.

125
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,429
I might as well
come straight to the point.

126
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,101
There's to be a full-scale
investigation into the riot,

127
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,375
and into the subsequent death of
the prisoner Michael Winchwood.

128
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,474
As part of your studies,
you are,

129
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,848
I note from your records,

130
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,150
familiar with
prison suicide awareness.

131
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,084
I would therefore like you
to agree to be part of

132
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,320
the investigation team,
Miss Hewitt.

133
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,783
Come on.

134
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,793
Helen Hewitt.

135
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,234
I've been trying to
contact you. We have a problem.

136
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,272
Tina's tried to kill herself.

137
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,036
- What did you say?
- Tina's tried to kill herself.

138
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,079
Shit!

139
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,813
Okay, listen.
Listen, just...

140
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,250
Just try and keep her calm,
and I'll be right there.

141
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,015
- You coming in?
- Yes, now!

142
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,128
She cut both wrists.

143
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,825
She seemed to accept it,

144
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,062
but the next minute
she went into association.

145
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,035
She did it
with Doreen Rigby's glasses.

146
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,110
Wait outside.

147
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm sorry I wasn't here, Tina.

148
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,460
Did you hear what I said?

149
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,898
Aye.

150
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,236
I said to meself,
if they take her,

151
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,034
really take her,
then I'll kill meself.

152
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,000
Soon as I'd made me mind up,
I could sleep,

153
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,910
like I'd made
the right decision.

154
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,504
I knew she'd gone.

155
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,017
I'm really sorry I wasn't here.

156
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,814
That's all right, Miss Hewitt.

157
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,582
It was funny.

158
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,386
I got that fat girl's glasses.

159
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,086
You know her... Doreen?

160
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,719
Anyway, I nicked her glasses.
I planned it!

161
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,457
They took me baby,
so I'd nobody else!

162
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,259
Tina.

163
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,095
The bloody things
wouldn't break!

164
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,344
I trod on them,
I jumped on them,

165
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,099
and I could barely break the
skin, never mind kill meself!

166
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,435
It was ridiculous.

167
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,270
And I started laughing.

168
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,480
I just want to know why,

169
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,954
after I left
specific instructions,

170
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,755
why nobody took the time to sit
with her, to stay with her.

171
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,590
Do you know what
she actually did?

172
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,962
She couldn't smash the glass,
so she broke one of the arms

173
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,228
and tried to gouge out
the veins in her arms!

174
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,668
We had
three new admissions today.

175
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,227
Well, that is no excuse.

176
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,715
What about one of
the probation officers,

177
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,672
any one of the officers?

178
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,265
I'm short-staffed as it is,

179
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,972
and the last thing I needed
was my deputy disappearing.

180
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,571
So it's my fault?

181
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,617
Nobody is directing blame
at anybody, Helen.

182
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,684
Oh, I am.

183
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,653
I am saying
that we are to blame.

184
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,983
And I am saying

185
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,251
you should not
have taken time out

186
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,384
without consulting me.

187
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,696
I understand you've been asked

188
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,323
to be a part
of the investigation team

189
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,425
looking into the riots
at Barfield Prison.

190
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,666
I think it'll be very good
for you, but a word of advice...

191
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,208
Just look and listen.

192
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,073
Don't run before you can walk,

193
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,636
or you'll fall down
right on top of your ambition.

194
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,411
Thanks for your advice,
Governor.

195
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,758
Congratulations.

196
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,830
Try now.

197
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,958
Miss Hewitt, sir.

198
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,397
Thanks.

199
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm sorry, I'm very late.

200
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,792
Gary Marshall,
the deputy governor.

201
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,361
- Ah.
- Would you like some coffee?

202
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,373
Uh, no, I think
we should join the others.

203
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,272
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, they're all here.

204
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:14,007
I've been instructed to, uh,
take you on a tour.

205
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,879
We'll catch the others up later.

206
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,418
As you said, you're very late.

207
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,495
There's a lot of mess in here,
so be careful.

208
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,740
I don't want to rush you,
but, um...

209
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,111
- Are these inmates?
- No, contractors.

210
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,583
There's about 20 men allocated
to clear this place out

211
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,584
as fast as possible.

212
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,177
- Private contractors?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,186
They're dumping the rubble

214
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,813
in the exercise yard
for the moment.

215
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,625
So the men held here
now have no exercise area?

216
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,397
From what I've gathered,
there were major drug problems.

217
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,335
No more than any other prison
of this size.

218
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,747
Right, everyone.
Lunch, I think.

219
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,258
- Tell Miss...
- Hewitt, sir.

220
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,352
Hewitt to carry on.

221
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,967
<i>Arnie Franks is getting worse.</i>

222
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,265
- Where's the governor?
<i>- In his office.</i>

223
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,431
All right,
I'll speak to Marshall.

224
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,904
The gov's in his office.

225
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,710
Now, I've told him you were
still showing her around,

226
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,512
but it's just that Arnie Franks
is creating a bit of the usual,

227
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,610
only he's getting very het up.

228
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,814
Look, when she's through here,
buzz me.

229
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,357
I'll collect her
and wheel her out.

230
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,949
- Where are the others?
- Not back from lunch.

231
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,518
Bit young, ain't she, Gary?

232
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,396
And a know-all.
Bloody university highflier.

233
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,833
Four years I waited
for governor three,

234
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,736
and I've just heard that she's
been promoted to it first time.

235
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,773
Bloody stupid.

236
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,437
Now, look, I'll sort Arnie out.
You just keep her busy.

237
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,212
Blimey, I didn't realize
you had <i>him</i> here.

238
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,218
Yeah, and he's not a happy man.

239
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,754
We got a formal complaint
after Winchwood.

240
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,755
Doesn't feel safe
with a murderer on the loose.

241
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,053
Considering he's a mass killer,
he's got a bloody nerve.

242
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,025
Does he reckon
Winchwood was murdered?

243
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,429
No, Winchwood was just the spark
that started the riot.

244
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,749
So have you got
all the ringleaders, then?

245
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,173
- Yeah, we got them.
- Yeah?

246
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,504
In fact, they were the problem.

247
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,087
We tried to get them out without
a row, and all hell broke loose.

248
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,636
Well, they're not
our problem anymore.

249
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,181
They've been shipped out.

250
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,774
So is Governor Langham
gonna be shafted?

251
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,782
I wouldn't know.

252
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,283
Tell me some more
about Winchwood.

253
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,639
I presume with his record,
he'd be a vulnerable prisoner,

254
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,132
so was he segregated?

255
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,460
Will Marshall be taking over
if Langham retires?

256
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,002
That'll be up to headquarters.

257
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,940
Could you take me
to Mr. Marshall, please?

258
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,986
See if you can calm him down.
If not, get back to me.

259
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,285
Governor.

260
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,827
Oh, excuse me. I was just
waiting for Mr. Marshall.

261
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,796
I'm Brian Langham.

262
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,095
Helen Hewitt, part of
the investigation team.

263
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:09,111
I have to uproot my wife,
my kids from their school.

264
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,982
I think I'm still in shock.

265
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,417
The riot was bad enough,

266
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,955
but they really pulled the rug
from under me.

267
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,322
Enforced retirement.

268
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:25,258
Well, somebody had to be
the scapegoat, I suppose.

269
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,871
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,444
Can I ask you something?

271
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,742
Michael Winchwood. It's been
put out it was suicide.

272
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,217
We won't get verification

273
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,016
until the autopsy reports
are finalized.

274
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,224
Yes?

275
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,936
You'd better come
on the VP Wing, sir.

276
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,292
I'll be right down.

277
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,627
I'm sorry, I have to
go to the VP Wing.

278
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,291
Do you mind if I come along?

279
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,430
I want to see Mr. Langham!

280
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,439
Shut up!

281
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,305
I'd nothing to do with it!

282
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,004
I need him!

283
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,911
Arnie.

284
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:21,579
Just listen to me.
I told you.

285
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,680
Arnie, don't!

286
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,725
Just listen to me!
Arnie.

287
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,555
Open it up.

288
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,925
Hey, hey, Arnie!

289
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,306
What do you think
you're doing, mate?

290
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,265
You got the whole corridor here.

291
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,131
I want my visiting order!

292
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,001
Arnie, you'll go
to the visiting rooms

293
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,267
at 10 minutes to 2:00,
okay, Arnie?

294
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,535
Does he need a sedative?

295
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,201
Look, give me a minute.

296
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,847
10 to 2:00, Arnie. Okay?

297
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,316
You'll get the visiting order
at 10 to 2:00.

298
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,421
Right, in you go!

299
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,393
Oh, this is a little bit
over the top, isn't it?

300
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,986
He hasn't had a visitor
for five years,

301
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,793
and because he's got
full-blown AIDS,

302
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,629
he's very dangerous.

303
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,693
He's also mentally subnormal
and as strong as an ox.

304
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,229
And very active sexually.

305
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,899
Oh, please, no!

306
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,846
Oh, no!

307
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:21,913
No!

308
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,779
No!

309
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,317
Is that Winchwood's cell?

310
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,613
Not anymore, ma'am.

311
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,986
Doughen, will you get
Miss Hewitt out in safety?

312
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,957
- Get her out!
- Governor.

313
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,526
Winchwood's cell.

314
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,203
They're coming in now. They want
to see Winchwood's cell.

315
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,269
Right!
Back to your cells!

316
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,343
Go on, move it!

317
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,209
Judge Simms,
Miss Hewitt has just arrived.

318
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,683
Uh, not just, actually.
I've been on a guided tour.

319
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,583
Miss Hewitt.

320
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,588
Now, these are
Governors Effinger, Swallow,

321
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,089
Hartington, Littlejohn, and...

322
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,887
Are we to wait for Mr. Langham?

323
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,228
Hello, Matthew.
Hello, Norman.

324
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,391
Have you been taking notes?

325
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,798
He barks out at the secretary,
but I've made...

326
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,303
Ah. Governor Langham.

327
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,707
Right, gentlemen, I've asked
to see Winchwood's cell.

328
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,371
If we could cut the chitchat.

329
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,879
It's this way.

330
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,478
Which one's the psychologist?

331
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,485
The nervous one.
With the twitch.

332
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,518
The police have asked

333
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,089
that we don't touch anything
inside the cell.

334
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,100
You want to go inside?

335
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,298
I don't think
it will be necessary

336
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,840
for all of us to go in.

337
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,303
Good God.

338
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,418
Suicide?

339
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,964
Get yourselves a coffee
and grab a chair.

340
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,663
Ah, Miss Hewitt.

341
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,899
Have you had a moment
to study the file?

342
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,567
No, I've only just
been given it.

343
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,974
Excuse me.

344
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,444
I want to start
the discussion straightaway.

345
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,607
As you can see,
the prison services

346
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,618
have supplied a scale model
of Barfield,

347
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,314
showing the relationship
of the various wings.

348
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,381
Uh, Mr. Effinger, do you feel
that the governor in charge,

349
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,256
Mr. Langham, is liable to
any disciplinary action?

350
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,592
Please keep your answer short
and to the point.

351
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,256
Well, to be quite honest...

352
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,857
That <i>is</i> the point.

353
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:55,958
Yes?

354
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,472
Well, I do think
there's some time discrepancy

355
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,269
in the statements
of several of the officers,

356
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:05,573
in particular, O'Keefe,

357
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,671
Doughen, Jensen,

358
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,773
Smith, and Mallard.

359
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,250
All these stated that A Wing...

360
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,651
That is, the VP Wing...

361
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,591
Was, at the time
of the first fire, locked.

362
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,820
Yes, continue.

363
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:26,389
Well, if you take
into consideration

364
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,094
the victim's injuries,

365
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,864
he could have been attacked.

366
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,098
But it has not been
verified by the police

367
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,368
that Michael Winchwood
<i>was</i> attacked.

368
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,637
To the contrary, we must accept

369
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,440
that the wounds
were self-inflicted...

370
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,511
Yes, but, sir...

371
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,243
his right and left
wrist artery, throat frontal,

372
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,478
and two chest wounds.

373
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,489
Excessive, I'll agree.

374
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,323
Yes, well, Winchwood, according
to the medical reports,

375
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,953
also received
extensive bruising.

376
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,463
But these have not been proved

377
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,328
to be inflicted
on the night of the riot.

378
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,423
They were in fact...

379
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,611
Do you have the medical report
from his previous prison?

380
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,629
Winchwood arrived
at Barfield from Hull

381
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,073
two weeks prior to the riot,

382
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,874
with bruising to his abdomen,
back, and buttocks.

383
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:18,008
I think we must move on from the
Winchwood injuries, as I said,

384
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,575
until we have verification
that it was suicide,

385
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,679
and not, for want
of a better word, murder.

386
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,487
I am uppermost interested
in finding out

387
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,789
how and why this riot occurred,

388
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,887
and where the blame
is to be directed.

389
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,398
Miss Hewitt,
I would appreciate it

390
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,764
if you read the file
in your own time.

391
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,531
Please pay attention
to the discussion.

392
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,635
Is the judge going
in his own car or with us?

393
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,644
- Is my car here?
- Mm.

394
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,956
Could you get social services
to make a set of photographs

395
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,642
of Tina's baby?

396
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,308
Because I'm asking you to, Enid.

397
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,217
If necessary,
I'll pay for them myself!

398
00:25:54,286 --> 00:26:00,317
The known ringleaders have been
named and are being dispersed.

399
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,386
However, as there were more than
150 prisoners

400
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:07,194
all admitting to taking part
in the riot,

401
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,859
it would be a time-consuming

402
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,199
and financially punitive
undertaking

403
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,671
to review each man's sentence.

404
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,937
Now, that being said,
I think in time

405
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,945
the ringleaders
must be publicly named

406
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,481
and their sentences
adjusted accordingly.

407
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,647
Governor Langham has agreed
to take an early retirement,

408
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,415
and no disciplinary action
will be taken

409
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,255
against any of
Barfield's officers.

410
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,228
The Home Office pathology report
is being sent by courier.

411
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,788
It is determined
that Michael Winchwood

412
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,130
committed suicide.

413
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,407
Suicide.
It's now been made public.

414
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,306
It is a complete
bloody whitewash.

415
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,868
Not entirely.
Brian Langham's lost his job.

416
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:58,384
Only one record adds...
Here it is...

417
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,180
"Detectives conducting
the inquiry

418
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,663
had previously thought
it was impossible

419
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,349
for a man to sustain
such injuries."

420
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,822
If you had anything
to say about it,

421
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,222
you've missed your opportunity.

422
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,192
I took your advice.

423
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,855
I looked, I listened,
I said nothing.

424
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,761
But I wish I had.

425
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,231
If Michael Winchwood
killed himself,

426
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,360
he was a bloody contortionist.

427
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,199
A moment.

428
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,365
Mr. Bunny...
Barfield's area manager...

429
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,533
You've, uh, met him?

430
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,338
Yes.

431
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,868
He just called
to offer me Barfield Prison.

432
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,278
You gonna take it?

433
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,840
Does that mean I'd... Does that
mean I'd run Kettering?

434
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,886
I turned it down.

435
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,013
He asked me about
your operational experience

436
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,819
in male prisons.

437
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,525
Me?

438
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,895
As governor?
Are you serious?

439
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,456
Did he say
there was a possibility?

440
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,059
Sorry to interrupt.

441
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,468
But the photos
of Tina's baby have arrived.

442
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,201
Enid said you were
going to pay for them.

443
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,937
What?
Oh, yes, yes, I did.

444
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,342
Apparently you said
it was urgent.

445
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,245
Right!
Right, I'll deal with it.

446
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,941
You have two adjudications,
Mrs. Redwood.

447
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,451
Thank you, Joyce.

448
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,180
Hmm.

449
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,231
You don't think they'll
offer her Barfield, do you?

450
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,190
I have a nasty feeling
they might.

451
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:16,524
Right, we want the new governor
settled and primed

452
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,906
before we announce it
to the field,

453
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,196
and in particular to the press.

454
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,393
Thank you.

455
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,204
You're taking a big chance.

456
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,240
Risk, more like it.

457
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,538
Oh, I don't think so.

458
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,100
I think the risk is minimal.

459
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,273
She'll have
200 prisoner officers

460
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,940
to look after 88 men.

461
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,042
See, she's strong academically.

462
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,246
Practical experience.

463
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,347
âª One for the money,
two for the show âª

464
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,688
âª Three to get ready,
now go, cat, go âª

465
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:51,560
âª But don't you
step on my blue suede shoes âª

466
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,795
âª You can do anything, but lay
off my blue suede shoes âª

467
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,565
âª You can knock me down,
step in my face âª

468
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,198
âª Slander my name
all over the place âª

469
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,573
âª Do anything
that you want to do âª

470
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,704
âª But, unh-unh, honey,
lay off of my shoes âª

471
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,044
Hi, Helen!
Over here!

472
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,753
Sorry I'm late, Beryl.

473
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,221
I said I'm sorry I'm late!

474
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,552
- Sit down!
- Oh!

475
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,616
Drinks for Helen!

476
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,793
Cheers.

477
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,796
Good luck, Beryl.
Cheers.

478
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,832
Cheers!

479
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,200
I thought you'd given it up.

480
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,467
God, I hate this.

481
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,838
I don't know how any sane person
could get up there

482
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,241
and make themselves
look so ridiculous.

483
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,212
You would never get me
doing that

484
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,976
in a month of bloody Sundays.

485
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,212
If she works out,
she can stay on.

486
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,245
If not, well, there's
a possibility that the prison

487
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,790
will be recategorized

488
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:55,419
and someone of a higher rank
will automatically take over.

489
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,862
You're right.
It's a good choice.

490
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,660
The press will love her.

491
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,964
She fitted in very well
on the investigation team.

492
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,369
Knows how to keep
her mouth shut.

493
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,838
So it's agreed?

494
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,434
Helen Hewitt will be
the new governor of Barfield.

495
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,604
âª Oh, no, not I âª

496
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,614
âª I will survive âª

497
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,241
âª Oh, as long as
I know how to love âª

498
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,717
âª I know I'll stay alive âª

499
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,720
âª I've got all my life to live âª

500
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,688
âª I've got all my love to give âª

501
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,656
âª I'll survive âª

502
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,056
âª I will survive âª

503
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,481
Congratulations.

504
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,585
I presumed I'd be taking over.

505
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,952
They at least had the decency
to let me know.

506
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,985
I'm sorry,
but as my deputy, Gary,

507
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,326
I'm gonna need
all the backup I can get.

508
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,397
You'll have it.

509
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,333
Uh, do you want coffee?

510
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,736
I'm sorry,
I don't know your name.

511
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,274
Mavis O'Connell.
I'm...

512
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,934
Secretary. Good.

513
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,769
Nice to meet you.
Nice to know I'm not alone.

514
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,872
This is Miss Helen Hewitt,
Mavis... the new governor.

515
00:31:55,947 --> 00:32:00,408
I like my coffee black
and in a china mug.

516
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,976
Do you have a percolator?

517
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,749
Uh, yeah, I think so.

518
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,485
It's Amaretto coffee.
I got used to it in the States.

519
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,084
Are we computerized here?

520
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,228
Pardon?

521
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,231
Are the staff files on computer?

522
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:17,235
Uh, no.
Well, not all of them.

523
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,294
Ah, right, well we'll have to
get that sorted out.

524
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,371
Thank you, Mavis.

525
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,969
What's this?

526
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,037
Uh, Michael Winchwood's family
are not too happy

527
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,481
with the findings
of the investigation results.

528
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,151
What?

529
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,315
I referred them to
the prison authorities.

530
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,884
Did you?

531
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,394
Do you want my honest opinion?

532
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,864
I don't think it was suicide.

533
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,009
We've got a problem.

534
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,576
New governor doesn't believe
Winchwood committed suicide.

535
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,053
Bollocks.

536
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:14,058
Just stick to the same stories,
okay? Agreed?

537
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,354
It'll be all right.

538
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,794
She can't prove anything,
can she?

539
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,492
Not if we make sure of it, no.

540
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,865
<i>Governor Hewitt would like
to meet all personnel available</i>

541
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,427
<i>in the cinema in 30 minutes.</i>

542
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,795
Oh.

543
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,957
Where's the ladies?

544
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,426
You go to the end
of the corridor,

545
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,868
first right, past the lifts,

546
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,248
and it's at the bottom
of the stairs

547
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,672
at the end
of the second corridor.

548
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,867
You'll need a key.

549
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,637
I haven't got the time
to walk half a mile

550
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,439
if I need to pee.

551
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,343
We'll make this one the ladies.

552
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,246
Got you working hard,
has she, Mavis?

553
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,679
You can say that again.

554
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,010
You know this toilet?

555
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,414
Can you get maintenance
to fix up

556
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,315
a proper "ladies only" notice
on the door?

557
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,820
Oh, yeah, Michael Winchwood's
family'll need visiting orders

558
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,254
for tomorrow.

559
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,347
They're coming here?

560
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,221
Oh.

561
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,593
I want that replumbed
and a shower unit put in.

562
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,258
Right.
Where's the cinema?

563
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,082
Here she comes.

564
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,891
That's Langham out, then.

565
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,641
That's enough!
Have a bit of respect.

566
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,711
Good morning.

567
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,611
Thank you.

568
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,211
First of all can I say
how pleased I am to be here

569
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,619
as the new governor of Barfield.

570
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,218
There are three things
that are probably worrying you

571
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,193
about my appointment.

572
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,524
One, that I'm a woman.

573
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,327
Two, my age.

574
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,231
And three, am I going to stay?

575
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,203
Well, the first two
I can do nothing about,

576
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,448
but with regards to the third,

577
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,941
let me tell you
that I am staying.

578
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,941
As you must all be aware,

579
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,877
the rebuilding of Barfield
will continue,

580
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,576
so our priority during
this period will be security,

581
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,209
but we are in
the enviable position

582
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,379
of having only 88 inmates

583
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,946
and enough officers
to control 400.

584
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,050
I intend to take a harsh line

585
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,585
with any inmate attempting
to create further disturbances

586
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,895
whilst Barfield
undergoes refurbishment.

587
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,229
Who does she think she is?

588
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,601
I will put my intentions in
writing on the bulletin board,

589
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,072
and I ask each of you
to give me every assistance

590
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,837
in establishing the new regime.

591
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,039
My first order, as from today,

592
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:58,049
is to withdraw
all inmates' personal cell keys.

593
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,379
Quiet!

594
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,181
Thank you.

595
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,753
I look forward to working
with you all

596
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,418
and getting to know each of you
on a personal basis.

597
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:11,452
If any of you now have
any complaints or queries,

598
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,997
please feel free to voice them.

599
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,199
Thank you very much.

600
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,071
All right, that's enough.

601
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,784
- Mavis, what...
- I know, I know.

602
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:41,088
"or passed on any narcotic
substances," blah, blah, blah.

603
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,685
"As from now, every man and
woman coming into this prison

604
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,002
must be willing to be searched,

605
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,623
and that includes
all staff members.

606
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,999
My intentional priority is to
clear Barfield Prison of drugs."

607
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:54,096
She also wants every cell
and inmate strip-searched

608
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,368
as from 11:30 tomorrow morning.

609
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,605
Right, Murphy, strip search!

610
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,568
You tell them new bastards
they'll be sorry!

611
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,661
You can do it yourself, Murphy.

612
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,797
Right, now, move it!

613
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,205
You better put that on your
possessions list, Vernon.

614
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,244
Come on! Get back in!

615
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,280
Get yourself in order!
Governor's doing her rounds.

616
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,281
Make sure we're doing her orders
to the letter.

617
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,208
Governor's doing her rounds.

618
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,496
- All clear?
- Yeah, we're clear.

619
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,217
Strip search completed.
Ready for inspection.

620
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,021
No problems.

621
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,223
Right, then!

622
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,992
New governor coming around!

623
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,228
One of you put one foot out
of line, you're down the block!

624
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,706
Staff are very edgy about
the landing being searched.

625
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,337
If there are drugs
in this prison, Gary,

626
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,489
then I am going to find them,

627
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,415
and I am going to find out
who is bringing them in.

628
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,052
- Morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

629
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,722
Did you ever think that maybe,

630
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,020
just maybe,
it could be the prisoners?

631
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,526
What are you telling me, that
the prisoners are going out,

632
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,871
they're leaving,
they're scoring,

633
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,272
and they're bringing it
back in again?

634
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,788
- I meant their visitors.
- Ah, visiting rights.

635
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,335
As from tomorrow,
they will be reinstated.

636
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,427
It's gonna weigh very heavy
with security.

637
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,439
And we need to get back
to the basics of security.

638
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,566
Any visitor discovered
passing or bringing in drugs

639
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,077
will have their visit curtailed
and further visits reviewed,

640
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,613
possibly facing
criminal charges.

641
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,613
I'm warning you...

642
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,843
And I'm warning you
'cause I have not finished.

643
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,044
I have only just started.

644
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,144
- Mr. Morgan?
- Ma'am.

645
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,620
Good morning.
It's Mr. Layton, isn't it?

646
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,783
Good morning.

647
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,622
This is the new governor,
Miss Hewitt.

648
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,733
Good morning, Miss Hewitt.

649
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,696
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

650
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,241
I'll need to tour the VP Wing
tomorrow morning.

651
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,241
Yes.

652
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,471
Mr. and Mrs. Winchwood,
plus a Norman Sewell,

653
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,055
and I've two girls
from the temp agency

654
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,012
waiting to be interviewed,

655
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,242
and the furniture removal firm
have called twice.

656
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,060
Hold the Winchwoods,
send in one girl at a time,

657
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,095
give them five minutes each.

658
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,850
And Mavis, call an agency, get
them to clean my flat, anything.

659
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,855
It is a complete mess.

660
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,867
And tell the removal company
I'm missing two crates.

661
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,669
I'm sorry, Gary, you're gonna
have to excuse me.

662
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,437
Don't you want me
in on the Winchwood meeting?

663
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,554
No.

664
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,666
Mavis.

665
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,931
Has HQ called her
about the Winchwood visit?

666
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,996
I don't think so.

667
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,805
You have Sarah Green
and Moira Levitt

668
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,108
to see you... the temps.

669
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,775
I'll send in Sarah Green.

670
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,621
Royston Andrews speaking.

671
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,621
It's Marshall.

672
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,453
I think you should know
the Winchwood family

673
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,457
have turned up here.

674
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,016
Just find out what
the Winchwoods want

675
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,823
and then get back to me
as soon as you can.

676
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,592
No.
Get Miss Hewitt to contact me.

677
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,691
It's the WordPerfect program.
Good.

678
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,566
Mind you, probably with
the amount of staff references,

679
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,664
it would be best to have the
Windows program on disc as well.

680
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,708
Does it worry you,
working in a prison?

681
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,770
Even just temporarily?

682
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,110
No.
Why should it?

683
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,014
They're not running the offices,
are they?

684
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,882
I don't know about that.

685
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,318
Thank you very much
for coming in.

686
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,616
I'll call your agency.
Mavis.

687
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,054
Thanks for seeing me.

688
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,425
Send in Mr. and Mrs. Winchwood.
Who's the man with them?

689
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,394
I don't know.

690
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,989
Oh, ask, Mavis,
and all will be divulged.

691
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,261
And the last girl,
if her details check out,

692
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,496
and she's okay with security,
give her the job.

693
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,835
- That one?
- There were only two, Mavis.

694
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,069
Oh, and ask her to wear
a longer skirt.

695
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,544
Oh, Mavis, did you get someone
to clean my flat?

696
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,841
Shit.

697
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,555
Oh!

698
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:26,370
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Winchwood
and their legal advisor,

699
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,844
Mr. Norman Sewell.

700
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,710
Please, do come in.

701
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,977
I do apologize
for the state of my office.

702
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,382
Coffee, Mavis.

703
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,942
Please, sit down.

704
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,885
Thank you.

705
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,891
We wished to see you with regard
to the police investigation

706
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,988
into our son's death.

707
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,590
We're very disappointed.

708
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,294
No arrest has been made,

709
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,530
and yet everybody concerned
in this tragic affair

710
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,334
knows that Michael died
in what can only be described

711
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,275
as a horrific, violent,
and disgusting manner.

712
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,677
He was prepared to do his
sentence, serve his punishment.

713
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,010
He should have been protected

714
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,313
from the other inmates
and from himself.

715
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,778
Michael was,
as you must have been aware,

716
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,449
due to the type of crimes
he had committed,

717
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,254
segregated from
the main prison wings.

718
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,852
Mr. and Mrs. Winchwood
have asked me to undertake

719
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,558
a private civil action
against Barfield Prison,

720
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,226
citing gross negligence
to blame for the death

721
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,600
of their son Michael.

722
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,266
Did Michael ever mention
any particular prisoner

723
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,273
who made threats?

724
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:34,711
Not at his first prison,
but here at Barfield.

725
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,779
No.

726
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,474
You must understand.

727
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,017
Even though every precaution
is taken

728
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,684
to protect sex offenders...

729
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,694
Particularly
child sex offenders,

730
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,993
and in Michael's case
a brutal child murder.

731
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,761
There's no need for this,
Miss Hewitt.

732
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,964
I am, Mr. Sewell,
simply stating facts

733
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,439
and the problems
that we have with men on Rule 43

734
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,238
within a prison of this size.

735
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,746
You see, they're not all
sex offenders.

736
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:13,012
Some are in debt and scared
to be on the main prison wings.

737
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,883
Others are mentally vulnerable.

738
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:23,056
And there was
a full-scale police inquiry

739
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,222
and an investigation
by the prison authorities

740
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,356
into Michael's death.

741
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,230
Investigation or cover-up?

742
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,293
Have you seen
the medical reports?

743
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,999
There was, to my knowledge,
no cover-up, Mr. Sewell.

744
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,598
None whatsoever.
Thank you, Mavis.

745
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,337
Black or white, Mrs. Winchwood?

746
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,247
- What's going on?
- She said there was no cover-up.

747
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,844
None whatsoever.

748
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:54,048
Would you drop the civil action

749
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,060
if I personally undertake
an investigation

750
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,891
into your son's death?

751
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,830
All I want is justice.

752
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,268
I shall see that you get it,
Mr. Winchwood.

753
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,364
I'm the new governor.

754
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,828
I'm afraid Mr. Langham
isn't here anymore.

755
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,340
I know.
They've told me.

756
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,245
You've requested
a visiting order.

757
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,406
There you are.

758
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,109
All you have to do
is fill in the form.

759
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,394
It is what you wanted, isn't it?

760
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,936
- Morning Miss.
- Morning.

761
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,673
How long has Arnie Franks
been on all this medication?

762
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:23,942
Ain't got a clue.

763
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:26,382
He's just been brought back
on the wing from the hospital.

764
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,009
He should be in Broadmoor,
not in here.

765
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,054
I don't know
what gets him going.

766
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,421
You should try and find out.
These men are in your care.

767
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:37,553
It does help if you know or
are aware of what upsets them.

768
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,460
I'll speak to Dr. Thomas.

769
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,033
Hey.

770
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,633
That form you gave him...
He's eating it.

771
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,178
Perhaps it's preferable

772
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:58,182
to that congealed mess
we call breakfast.

773
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,945
See if you can get him
some exercise today.

774
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,043
If you say so.

775
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,985
You weren't on duty the night
Michael Winchwood died.

776
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,459
No. I was called in
for the riot. We all were.

777
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,630
- How did you get on with him?
- I didn't.

778
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,493
It's, um, Mr. Jackson,
isn't it?

779
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,068
Yes.

780
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,039
What's your first name?

781
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,370
Curtis.

782
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,209
Well, Curtis, I worked very hard
for the title "governor."

783
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,440
Please use it.

784
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,385
You keep that dog away from me!

785
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,717
Keep away from me!

786
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,294
Okay, let's move it.

787
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,761
Where's she this morning?

788
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,991
VP Wing.
Stop panicking.

789
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,296
Just as long as she's not
talking to those two bastards.

790
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,004
Bit of trouble there.

791
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,445
Good morning, ma'am.

792
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:19,594
Prisoner 653.
Gregory Colly, ma'am.

793
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:23,457
Good morning, Gregory.

794
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,402
Good morning, miss.
Welcome to my billet.

795
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,371
Did they tell you
about my glue situation.

796
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:33,275
Mr. Langham
always saw to it personally.

797
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,273
Oh.

798
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,813
I never cheat.

799
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,351
Never stick a few together.

800
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,011
Always one at a time.

801
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,884
Perfectionist, me.

802
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,549
Very, very impressive.

803
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,328
You were
on the same landing as...

804
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,527
Michael Winchwood, yes.
That is correct, miss.

805
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,594
But it's imperative
that I get me glue.

806
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,835
Now, I know the problem, I know.

807
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:08,642
I have, swear on the Bible,
never been under the influences.

808
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,613
It's too precious a substance
to me.

809
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,240
You understand, miss?

810
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,841
I know about
your request, Gregory.

811
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:14,995
I'll see that you get your glue.

812
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,612
Oh, God bless you.

813
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,350
I've not been able to sleep.

814
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,652
Where were you on the night

815
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,250
that Michael Winchwood
attempted suicide?

816
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,694
Out for the count.
Heavy sleeper, miss.

817
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,529
Did you ever hear anyone
make any threats against him?

818
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,000
Did you talk to him?

819
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,969
Me?! Who me?

820
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:35,233
I-I'm a special.

821
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,741
I used to be segregated
for my own safety.

822
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,438
I still don't ever see nobody.

823
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,073
Thank you, Gregory.

824
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,349
I miss the music, though.

825
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,448
Winchwood played nice music.

826
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:54,685
Opera.

827
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,834
- Know what he's in for?
- Yeah.

828
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,240
Ah, well.
He's still got his hobby.

829
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,800
Did Michael Winchwood
have a hobby?

830
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:16,473
Oh, yeah... making our life
bloody difficult.

831
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,995
Right! Button it!

832
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,000
Any more of this,
and they're gonna blow.

833
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,262
Can you put the pace on?

834
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:49,470
Quiet down up there!
Quiet down!

835
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,427
But is this really
all we got from the cells?

836
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,579
They're tossing it.

837
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,987
They're just flinging it
out of the windows?

838
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,616
No matter how decent the cell...
Own toilet, et cetera...

839
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,025
They still have to chuck
their shit out the window.

840
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,858
And not just the type you smoke.

841
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,228
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe.

842
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:10,427
Home brew from the slop bucket.

843
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,333
Disgusting.

844
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,107
I'd say this is about
all we're likely to get.

845
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,107
Hmm.

846
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,011
Is there any way that
any prisoner from B Wing

847
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,106
can transfer goods
from one division to another?

848
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,311
Other than just
throwing it out the window.

849
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,318
Yeah.

850
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,845
They tie it with a bit
of dental floss and swallow it.

851
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,100
I mean,
what do you want us to do,

852
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,683
get X-ray units in here next?

853
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,799
They stuff it in their ears,
stuff it up their nose,

854
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:38,885
stuff it up their ass.

855
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:39,963
Thank you.

856
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,163
I still want another search.

857
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,732
This time we'll go in at night
when they're not expecting it.

858
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:53,004
I want all prisoners
out of their cells.

859
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,205
That is, all non-VP prisoners.

860
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,475
What? No way.

861
00:51:57,548 --> 00:52:00,211
At this moment,
tension is way out of hand.

862
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,595
Right,
so we'll give them something

863
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,896
to take their minds
off the tension.

864
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,000
In my office, please, Gary.

865
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,299
Do you want to speak
to Dr. Thomas?

866
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,301
Well, these are his surgery
and home numbers.

867
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:20,167
Fine. Thank you.
See if he's free for lunch.

868
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,074
Have you ever heard of caution?

869
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,510
Hmm?
You've only dealt with women.

870
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,878
Let me tell you, these men here
are ready to blow.

871
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:33,816
They're already uptight over
losing their cell-key privileges

872
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,080
and you can't keep
pushing prisoners

873
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,314
like Murphy and Jellings.

874
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,016
When did these men
last have a movie?

875
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,251
I don't know.
Uh, before the riots.

876
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,769
Right, so we'll give them
a movie night.

877
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,786
And, Gary, in future
will you please remember

878
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,594
that I am the governor here,
not you.

879
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,328
What you do want?
"Aladdin"?

880
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,735
I want them to see
the movie voluntarily, Gary.

881
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:56,205
Oh, right. We'll give them
Sharon Stone then, eh?

882
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,708
That'll do fine.

883
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,547
And could you
tell Officer O'Keefe

884
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,095
I'd like to speak to him
this morning?

885
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,517
I'll be in the gymnasium
in 10 minutes.

886
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,700
Could you tell me about
the night of the riots?

887
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,796
Exactly where you were
and what interaction you had

888
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,238
with the prisoners.

889
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,907
We've all given statements
to the police,

890
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,274
to the investigation team.

891
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,244
Yes, I know, so it shouldn't
be too difficult

892
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,440
to recall your movements
that night, should it?

893
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,313
I did the lockup checks
on B Wing about 7:30.

894
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,162
Then I checked all
the open areas that's near...

895
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:45,588
The cinema, the laundry,
then I went to the canteen.

896
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:46,715
Alone?

897
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,919
No, Tom Doughen was with me,
Russell Morgan,

898
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,621
and I think Jensen.

899
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,664
Jensen, Smith, and Mallard.

900
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,461
Yes, go on.

901
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,057
Had a cup of coffee
and a sandwich,

902
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:00,195
then, oh, maybe about half 8:00
I went to do the VP Wing.

903
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,550
Where Michael Winchwood
was held?

904
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,198
Yes.

905
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,468
Alone?

906
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,806
Yeah, he was segregated.

907
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,812
No, were <i>you</i> alone?

908
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,280
No.
Tom Doughen was with me.

909
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,374
This is all in the report book,
you know?

910
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,351
Yes, I know.
Do go on.

911
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:17,787
We checked Winchwood.

912
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,032
We had a few threats
against him,

913
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:20,957
so we were keeping him
under supervision.

914
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,017
A few threats?
Would you care to elaborate?

915
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,087
Well, we always get them
with child molesters.

916
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,690
Sex offenders,
it's part of the norm.

917
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,259
I am aware of that.

918
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:34,771
But which prisoners
did you know or were aware

919
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,864
had made threats
against Michael Winchwood?

920
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,670
Most of them
at some time or other.

921
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,843
But on the night in question,
two prisoners...

922
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:47,578
Murphy and Jellings...
Became excessively violent.

923
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,586
Do you think they could
have had anything to do

924
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,053
with Michael Winchwood's death?

925
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,680
No, I don't.

926
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,749
You and Officer Doughen
were instigating lockup

927
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:56,826
when the fire broke out.

928
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,793
Yes.

929
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,796
Were all the prisoners
locked in their cells?

930
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,197
- Yes.
- Including Vernon Black?

931
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:04,599
Yes.

932
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,236
Could you ask Officer Doughen
to be in my office in, say,

933
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,241
10 minutes?

934
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,004
Yes, Governor.

935
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:33,764
Mavis, if Officer Doughen
is there,

936
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,561
can you send him in, please?

937
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,878
On the night of the riots,
you have stated that

938
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,314
all prisoners on the VP Wing

939
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,044
were locked up
when the fire started.

940
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,117
Yeah, that's right.

941
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,186
On that night, Vernon Black
was in the VP Wing.

942
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:03,694
Yes, but he's subsequently
been transferred to C Wing.

943
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,589
- After the fire?
- Yes.

944
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,259
So he's not
a vulnerable prisoner?

945
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,236
Not anymore.

946
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,205
I think he owed money.
They're not all sex offenders.

947
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,707
I do know that, Mr. Doughen.

948
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,207
I am simply making sure
that Vernon Black was,

949
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,805
on the night of the fire,
locked in his cell.

950
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:28,080
The reason must be obvious.

951
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,278
Sorry?

952
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,054
Vernon Black is an arsonist,

953
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,456
and according
to the fire team's findings,

954
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,017
the first fire began
in the kitchen area

955
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,791
of the VP Wing.

956
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,890
Well, he must have
been questioned.

957
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:48,299
Yes, he was.
Thank you, Mr. Doughen.

958
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,292
It's Mr. Black, isn't it?

959
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,207
You're here for five years,
and you've done...

960
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,802
18 months.
Transferred from Leeds.

961
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,608
Mm-hmm.

962
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,205
Did you prefer it there?

963
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,443
Well, it was easier
for me mother to see there.

964
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,213
Mm.

965
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,277
Why were you in the VP Wing,
Mr. Black?

966
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:40,813
Well, I owed Murphy
a few quid for phone cards.

967
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,417
I had to wait for a visit
before I could pay him back.

968
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,019
- Have you paid him back now?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

969
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,090
- Thank you very much, Mr. Black.
- It's okay.

970
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,234
It's okay.

971
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,348
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hi.

972
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,582
- Can I get you another?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

973
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,716
Usual for me, Don.

974
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,002
Do you mind if we go to a table?

975
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,858
I sit at the bar,
and it's open surgery.

976
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,123
Sure.

977
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,232
So, Miss Hewitt.
Or do I call you Governor?

978
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,438
Helen.
Have a sandwich.

979
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,605
Thanks.

980
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,684
Mm! Mmm.
Lovely, thank you.

981
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:45,382
Thanks.

982
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,651
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

983
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,656
Was Michael Winchwood suicidal?

984
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,565
I don't know.

985
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,296
I've looked over his records,
obviously.

986
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,396
My predecessor
didn't appear to think so,

987
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:04,441
or he would have
made a note of it.

988
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,171
Is this tuna?

989
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,906
Quite possibly.

990
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,742
You ever worked
in a prison before?

991
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,216
No.

992
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,982
But you must be aware of our
present problems with narcotics?

993
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,387
Well, of course I'm aware,

994
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:21,789
but until the government
or the Home Office

995
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,850
admit that it's a problem,

996
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,555
as far as I can ascertain,

997
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,507
it's turned a blind a eye
if it keeps them quiet.

998
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,432
Well, not any longer.

999
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,798
Any prisoner
discovered taking drugs

1000
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,269
will get an extra 28 days
on his sentence,

1001
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,238
solitary confinement,
and loss of privileges.

1002
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,367
Possession and drug trafficking
is illegal,

1003
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:42,641
and mandatory drug tests will
become the regular procedure.

1004
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,207
<i>A Wing... showers.</i>

1005
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,809
They bring those friggin' dogs
inside our pads again,

1006
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:49,818
and I'll have her.

1007
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,048
You hear me?!

1008
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:55,058
Listen, all the men
are on our side.

1009
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,855
They try to pin anything on us,

1010
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,864
we'll start a nice little riot
for that stiff whore bitch.

1011
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:04,230
Anybody having her, and it's me.

1012
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,792
Piss off, Vernon.

1013
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,304
Hey, have you heard?
We've got a film showing.

1014
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,704
It's that one with Sharon Stone
showing her

1015
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,299
Vernon, piss off.

1016
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,775
Go on.
Get out of it.

1017
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:16,279
- Give me a towel.
- Honest.

1018
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,008
Doughen told us.

1019
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,812
Hey, O'Keefe,
is he having us on?

1020
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,512
On the level, Murphy.

1021
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:26,079
Sharon Stone?
You're a lying bastard.

1022
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,590
Not in person, Murphy.

1023
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,853
Come on. You've been in here
over your time.

1024
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,861
You having a problem with that?

1025
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,260
Or are you shitting yourself

1026
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,663
because Winchwood's parents
came here?

1027
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:36,732
Ha ha ha ha!

1028
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,928
Look, Miss...
Helen.

1029
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,270
I'm a doctor.

1030
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,085
I don't know anything
about running a prison,

1031
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,304
and I don't take any sides.

1032
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,040
I just do my job
when I'm called out.

1033
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,914
And I intend to do my job
and rid Barfield of drugs.

1034
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,617
Well, I'll give you
every assistance I can.

1035
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,213
And you're gonna need it.

1036
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,088
Thanks.

1037
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,424
Um, listen...

1038
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,621
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1039
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,995
Maybe we could meet again
and discuss drug rehabilitation.

1040
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,144
Sure. You know where I am.
All you need to do is call.

1041
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,467
Don, okay if I use the phone?

1042
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:14,869
I can arrange for you to meet

1043
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,873
the local rehab center's
administrator.

1044
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,873
Oh, brilliant.

1045
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,375
And perhaps we could
also instigate

1046
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:20,722
some sessions inside the prison,

1047
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,906
And, um, if you're free
for dinner...

1048
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,778
I'm on your side, Miss Hewitt.

1049
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,944
It's Dr. Thomas.
Mm-hmm.

1050
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,961
Murphy.

1051
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,214
So, what do you think
of the food here?

1052
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,977
It's okay.

1053
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,678
But you work out,
though, don't you?

1054
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,219
Do you think you get
enough protein?

1055
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,812
Yeah, I get in extra.

1056
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,221
You get in brought in?

1057
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,259
Yeah.
We all do.

1058
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,228
Those that can afford it.

1059
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:16,858
Not telling tales.
It was even in the papers.

1060
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,493
Do you smoke?

1061
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,663
No.

1062
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,713
So you're the new governor,
then?

1063
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,509
My, my, my.

1064
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,077
Whose face did you sit on?

1065
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:39,986
I didn't hear that.

1066
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,562
What other perks do you get?

1067
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,534
On the night of the riot,
Mr. Murphy,

1068
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,100
could you tell me what happened?

1069
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,072
You a bull dyke, then?

1070
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,208
What did you say?

1071
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,377
You a dyke?

1072
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,387
- Am I a what?
- Lesbian.

1073
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,219
You're one, are you?

1074
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,385
That's why you got the job.

1075
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,757
Act like a man.

1076
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,262
You a dyke?

1077
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,231
The night of the riot,
Mr. Murphy.

1078
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,562
Answer the question.

1079
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,632
Banged up as usual.

1080
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,368
Then the fire started.

1081
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:36,106
They unlocked our spurs,
held us over in the quad.

1082
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:38,607
That's it.

1083
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,548
What time were taken
out of lockup?

1084
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,755
I don't know.
My watch stopped.

1085
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,258
"Prisoner 493, Anthony Murphy,
became violent and abusive."

1086
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,458
That was at 8:30.
Mr. Murphy, is that correct?

1087
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:59,970
I don't know.
My watch stopped.

1088
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,471
- Do you know Michael Winchwood?
- No.

1089
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,598
But you knew who he was?

1090
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,007
Yeah, we knew he was here.

1091
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,273
What did you think of him?

1092
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:13,784
He raped and tortured two little
girls aged nine and seven.

1093
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,787
He buggered an eight-year-old
boy, then buried him.

1094
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,222
So why don't you tell me
what you think about him?

1095
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,953
Did you ever threaten him?

1096
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,757
- Personally? No.
- You didn't?

1097
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,923
You must be the only man here
who didn't.

1098
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,234
Par for the course, isn't it?

1099
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,430
A perverted, twisted animal.

1100
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:37,474
All nonces should be castrated.

1101
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,008
So you did threaten him?

1102
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,010
You're putting words
into my mouth, love.

1103
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,673
I never said I did,
and I never said I didn't.

1104
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:47,240
He topped himself.

1105
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,047
Saves a lot of aggravation.

1106
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,782
Saves the government
a lot of cash.

1107
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:55,690
Costs a grand a week to keep
filth like him segregated.

1108
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,321
Costs almost as much
to keep you too, Mr. Murphy.

1109
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,127
You're new to this job,
aren't you?

1110
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,401
Otherwise you wouldn't bother
wasting your time

1111
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,061
with shits like Winchwood.

1112
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:10,039
What time's
this movie starting, then?

1113
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:16,478
Mr. Murphy,
I will treat you with respect

1114
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,072
as long as you apply
the same rules to me.

1115
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,880
When I interview you again, one,

1116
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,216
just one sexual innuendo,

1117
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,279
and I will take it personally.

1118
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:29,349
I am the governor
of this prison.

1119
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:33,295
You will stand up when I enter
your cell and when I leave.

1120
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:36,299
Now, is that clear?

1121
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,972
Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

1122
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,133
Suck on it, sweetheart.

1123
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,321
Nonce!

1124
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:08,729
Nonce!

1125
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,063
You dirty bastard!

1126
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,877
Come on, Arnie.
Come away.

1127
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,649
Come on.

1128
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,749
Murphy knows
Winchwood's family are here.

1129
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,658
Who knows
how they get to know everything

1130
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:39,661
that's bloody going on?

1131
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,823
As long as we stick
to what we've said throughout,

1132
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,230
nothing can happen.

1133
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,029
And at the rate
Wonder Woman's going on,

1134
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,364
she won't last out the week.

1135
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,632
First we lock up the VP
straightaway.

1136
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,402
Choose a few number of officers
to do the strip searches.

1137
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:52,840
Use as few as possible

1138
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,572
'cause we'll need
all the officers for the cinema.

1139
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:58,547
C Wing is priority, then D Wing.

1140
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,914
We've got to keep them in
the cinema as long as possible.

1141
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,976
We've got a good two hours
to do the strip search.

1142
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,214
I don't think she has any idea
what she's bloody doing.

1143
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:06,950
What if they don't
want to see the movie?

1144
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,390
What, Sharon Stone? Hmm!
You kidding?

1145
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,394
Jammy sods.

1146
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:17,666
Maybe she's not the pushover
we thought.

1147
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:20,431
There is such a thing
as being overloyal.

1148
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,269
What's that supposed to mean?

1149
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,607
I'm not involved in this,
and you don't have to be.

1150
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,114
You'd better tell her
before she finds out.

1151
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,805
I think
we've almost got a full house.

1152
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,363
These are the no-shows.

1153
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,341
Well, let's hope
Sharon simmers them down.

1154
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,308
I wouldn't bank on it.

1155
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,054
There's a Mr. Andrews
from prison services.

1156
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,740
- Oh.
- No, no, he's here.

1157
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:05,338
Oh, boy,
that's what I call timing.

1158
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,348
How are we doing?

1159
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,416
- Waiting on another 15, ma'am.
- Hurry them along.

1160
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,249
Evening, sir.
We're all ready to go.

1161
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,389
We've got 70 men.

1162
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,227
All of them, after today's
business, very edgy.

1163
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,392
We've got every officer on duty.

1164
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,197
That's day and night staff.

1165
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,363
Do you think
she's just out of her depth?

1166
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,872
I'd say she's drowning.

1167
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,067
Joke.
Just a joke.

1168
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,206
Seriously, it should be...

1169
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,620
Has Gary given you an update?

1170
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:51,490
Right, as soon as the men
are in the cinema, let me know.

1171
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,158
Mr. and Mrs. Winchwood
have informed me

1172
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,327
that you have instigated
a new investigation

1173
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,961
into the death of their son.

1174
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:03,029
Is that correct, Miss Hewitt?

1175
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,439
We want Sharon!

1176
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:13,950
We want Sharon!
We want Sharon!

1177
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:15,576
Sharon, Sharon!

1178
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:20,022
We want Sharon!
We want Sharon!

1179
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,591
I do not believe

1180
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,992
that Michael Winchwood
committed suicide,

1181
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:27,792
but that he was
physically attacked.

1182
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:30,390
I am not sure which of
the officers were involved,

1183
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:33,402
but I think they were prepared
to turn a blind eye

1184
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,802
as long as Michael Winchwood
only got a severe beating,

1185
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,933
and it got out of hand.

1186
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,476
Do you have any evidence

1187
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,273
to substantiate
what you've just said?

1188
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,339
Or is it all supposition?

1189
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,010
I suggest you come
to the cinema immediately.

1190
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,364
<i>Strip
search of C Wing in progress.</i>

1191
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,638
Okay, we've got two hours,
so there's no hurry.

1192
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,979
Be thorough.
Go through everything.

1193
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,644
Go on.
Get on with it.

1194
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,518
âª What you looking for? âª

1195
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:29,320
âª What you looking for? âª

1196
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,261
The new governor, Miss Hewitt.

1197
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,026
âª What you looking for? âª

1198
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,557
âª What you looking for? âª

1199
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:25,174
Would you be quiet
and let Miss Hewitt finish?

1200
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,787
We want to see the film!

1201
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,729
I have a complaint.
Where's the movie?!

1202
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,670
- Yeah!
- Where is it?!

1203
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,112
Put the movie on.
Show the bloody film!

1204
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,310
Ohh.

1205
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,381
Temazepam sleeping tablets.

1206
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,636
The prisoner's that are
on prescribed tabs store them...

1207
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,152
Especially these...
Crush them, and mainline them.

1208
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,467
They're using their own kettles
to clean needles.

1209
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,473
We found three so far.

1210
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:14,433
Do you want me to get someone
to take you home?

1211
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:17,894
No, I'll be fine, really.
I'm fine.

1212
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,089
Well, I made
a really big fool of myself.

1213
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,860
Oh, we all have at one time.

1214
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,869
Made a fool of ourselves.

1215
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,962
The discovery of drugs
was very good,

1216
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:31,701
but when the film finishes
there's gonna be trouble.

1217
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,676
Fortunately we've got enough
prison officers to handle it,

1218
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:38,237
so go home, Helen.

1219
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:41,614
We're all at your disposal
whenever you need us.

1220
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:43,050
Thank you.

1221
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,087
Just drop this
Winchwood business, hmm?

1222
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,055
And, uh, put tonight behind you.

1223
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,371
Governor, Miss Hewitt's
here on the stairs.

1224
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:39,681
I think you'd better come down.

1225
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,012
She misses you.

1226
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,719
Yeah, I didn't
think you'd still be here.

1227
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:00,262
Catching up with paperwork.

1228
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,266
My youngest has been ill.
She's better now.

1229
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,995
I just popped up to see Tina.

1230
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,799
She seems fine too.
Hmm.

1231
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,332
She seems to be coming to terms
with everything.

1232
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:18,073
- How's everything at Barfield?
- Oh, completely out of control.

1233
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,812
I made a very big
fool of myself tonight,

1234
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,853
right in front of
the operationals director.

1235
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,649
I'm sorry.

1236
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,691
He was very nice
about it, actually.

1237
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:32,456
There's been a lot of resentment
about my appointment.

1238
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,360
Well, that was expected,
wasn't it?

1239
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,437
Since my divorce, you know,
my job, heh,

1240
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:42,972
is everything to me.

1241
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,235
Barfield was the ultimate prize.

1242
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:49,267
It isn't a prize, Helen.
It's a tough and thankless job.

1243
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:53,874
I could have prewarned you,
but you wouldn't have listened.

1244
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:58,583
I didn't think it would be
quite so, um...

1245
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,780
lonely.

1246
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,052
Well, it is.

1247
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,686
So use me, Helen.

1248
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,389
Talk to me.

1249
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:16,205
I've lost my confidence.

1250
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:19,208
I don't think I can finish
what I started.

1251
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,642
Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1252
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,838
I didn't, uh, mean to do this.

1253
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,848
I've just got nobody else
to talk to.

1254
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,893
You know when I was a kid,
I always used to talk to my dad.

1255
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,647
He'd be somewhere on the farm.

1256
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,687
He'd give me really big hug,
and he'd say,

1257
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,450
"Come on, now, spit it out."

1258
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:37,653
He was a really, um, big man.

1259
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:41,527
I mean, um, his heart.

1260
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:45,433
I wanted John to be like my dad,
but he wasn't.

1261
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:48,528
I don't know why
I'm telling you this crap.

1262
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,904
You're not going to quit,
are you?

1263
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,402
I feel like it.

1264
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,506
Michael Winchwood
didn't commit suicide.

1265
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:00,743
He was murdered.

1266
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,445
But yet
I look at his case histories,

1267
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:06,648
I read what he actually did,
and the men are right.

1268
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,021
He was a disgusting
piece of humanity,

1269
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,185
and I think he got
everything he deserved,

1270
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,195
and why should I bother?!

1271
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:15,925
If you believe
there's been any injustice,

1272
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:21,062
any cover-up at Barfield Prison,
it's your job to prove it.

1273
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,598
You be angry
and get to the truth.

1274
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,279
We have trouble in C Wing!
Need some backup, over!

1275
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,457
Do you know
why they gave me Barfield?

1276
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:52,662
I think when the prison
is refurbished,

1277
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,931
the category will
possibly be changed,

1278
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:59,169
which would mean you are not
at high enough rank and...

1279
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,006
- I'd be replaced.
- It's just supposition.

1280
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,239
I may be wrong,
but it's gonna cost millions

1281
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:05,941
to put that prison
back in order.

1282
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:08,746
The bastards.

1283
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,581
And Marshall.

1284
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,384
My bloody deputy.
Do you think he knows?

1285
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,515
I think it's common knowledge,
Helen.

1286
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:18,083
That's why I turned it down.

1287
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,459
So I'm just a caretaker?

1288
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,831
Well, I'm a hell of a lot more
than that.

1289
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,469
And I shall prove it.

1290
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,823
I'm gonna
see this thing through,

1291
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,404
and then just let them
try and shift me.

1292
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:51,221
We're more bloody pissed off
than they are!

1293
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:54,627
We want in!
I want to go in!

1294
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:58,225
Don't go in there!
Are you crazy?!

1295
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,495
Now, listen to me!

1296
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,628
This is Officer Morgan,
and we are coming in!

1297
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:05,197
Any prisoner not in his cell

1298
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:06,708
Do you hear me?!

1299
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:12,046
It's over, mate.
You coming in with us?

1300
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,391
Helen Hewitt.

1301
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:26,588
It's Morgan.

1302
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:28,722
The riot situation

1303
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,063
I'll be right there.
No, I said I'm on my way.

1304
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:39,438
I want every available officer
standing by on C Wing landing.

1305
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,568
They want to go in!

1306
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:45,274
Nobody goes into that
bloody wing until I say so.

1307
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,475
Don't you think
it's until I say so?

1308
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,652
This is the governor!
This is Governor Hewitt!

1309
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,523
Get back in your cells now!

1310
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:04,676
I'm not going
down the block for any woman.

1311
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,362
Move it!

1312
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,837
Get back in your cells!
Go!

1313
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,073
Get out of my way!

1314
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,651
Bastards!

1315
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:30,925
Bastards! Bastards!

1316
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,928
This is the big riot?

1317
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:49,510
You.
Back to your cell.

1318
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:01,451
What are you doing?

1319
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:06,557
Nothing.

1320
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,229
Tell every man I want every cell
back in order

1321
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:15,965
by the time
I do my morning rounds.

1322
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,007
Yes, ma'am.

1323
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,073
Lockup!

1324
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,770
- Lockup!
- Lockup!

1325
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:36,524
Mr. Morgan.

1326
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,328
Thanks for calling me.
Why did you?

1327
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,062
This isn't tales
out of school, right?

1328
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,137
I don't think the cons

1329
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,934
should have been allowed
such privileges.

1330
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,099
They could lock us out.

1331
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:54,439
They could do
whatever they want in there.

1332
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,275
You were right to withdraw
cell keys, that's all.

1333
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,912
And that's why
you tipped me off?

1334
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:10,554
Ma'am, talk to Vernon Black.

1335
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,595
I already have.
He's an arsonist.

1336
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,594
He's also a junkie,

1337
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,427
and with nothing on the wing,
he'll be needing a fix.

1338
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:19,229
He might just talk to you.

1339
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,236
About what?

1340
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,033
Michael Winchwood.

1341
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,031
You gave me a shock.

1342
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,433
I was just checking
Winchwood's belongings.

1343
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,495
His parents want them.
Did you want me?

1344
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,684
Officer Doughen said
you wanted to see Vernon Black.

1345
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:35,974
He's in metalwork.
He's got the shakes.

1346
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,478
You won't get
any sense out of him.

1347
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,373
Okay!
Hold it!

1348
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,043
Hold it down a minute!

1349
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:45,246
Five-minute tea break.
Governor's on her way.

1350
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,016
Please remain in the area.

1351
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:49,558
Tool and equipment check.

1352
01:23:53,896 --> 01:23:55,262
Could you wait over there?

1353
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:58,600
Over there, please.

1354
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:06,867
On the night of the riot,
Vernon,

1355
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:08,774
you told me
you were on the VP Wing.

1356
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:11,279
And when the fire started
you were locked in your cell.

1357
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,338
Yeah.

1358
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,408
You are serving a prison
sentence for arson, aren't you?

1359
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:17,976
Yeah.

1360
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:22,081
Did you begin one of the fires
the night Winchwood was killed?

1361
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:27,955
Officer Doughen,
would you wait over there!

1362
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,903
What's the matter
with you, Vernon? Are you sick?

1363
01:24:36,972 --> 01:24:38,463
Are you running a temperature?

1364
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,304
What's the matter with you,
Vernon?

1365
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,310
I don't know anything.

1366
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:45,781
But I might.

1367
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:49,614
I want to go back closer
to where me mum can visit me.

1368
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:51,881
It'd help me to remember.

1369
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:58,016
Don't play games with me,
Vernon.

1370
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,892
I am not here
to make deals with you.

1371
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,363
- When was your last visit?
- It's been over a month.

1372
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,766
So you lied to me.

1373
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,395
You told me you were on the
VP Wing because you owed money,

1374
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,482
which you were able to pay back
after your last visit.

1375
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,203
Now I am asking you again,
on the night of the fire,

1376
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,302
were you locked in your cell?

1377
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:22,284
On the night Winchwood died,
did you see anything?

1378
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,713
Did you hear anything?

1379
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,623
Take him back to his cell.

1380
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,663
He shouldn't be in metalwork
in his condition.

1381
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,495
Michael Winchwood
had a radio/CD player,

1382
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:38,693
and it's not in his cell.

1383
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:39,860
Do you know where it is?

1384
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:41,279
He didn't have one, did he?

1385
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:44,273
Well, he must have had one.
There were two CDs in his cell.

1386
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,808
Would you check it out
for me, please?

1387
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,104
Oh, better still,

1388
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,736
get me prisoners'
possession lists, C Wing.

1389
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:57,177
Know anything
about Winchwood's CD player?

1390
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:01,417
The governor wants all C Wing's
inmates' possessions lists.

1391
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,719
Shit.

1392
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,551
Did Vernon Black put that
on his bloody list?

1393
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,459
I don't know.

1394
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:08,360
Don't back the wrong horse,
Gary.

1395
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,296
She's getting closer.

1396
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:17,198
Ah, do you recall what make
it was, Mr. Winchwood?

1397
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,138
Yeah.

1398
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,039
Yeah.

1399
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,547
And any of the CDs
that Michael might have had.

1400
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:27,048
Pavarotti, miss.

1401
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,710
Oh, that's wonderful.

1402
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,846
I need to talk to you.

1403
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,411
- Not now.
- When?

1404
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,081
I don't know, Gary.

1405
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:36,625
I'm sorry, what was that?

1406
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:43,294
Serial number LP-249.

1407
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,766
Thank you very much indeed,
Mr. Winchwood.

1408
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,428
Yes.

1409
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,836
Eight minutes!

1410
01:26:57,913 --> 01:26:59,711
Is there a fire?!

1411
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:03,628
- Don't go in.
- What's happened in there?

1412
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:06,212
- I wouldn't go in.
- Excuse me!

1413
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:07,847
Come on, breathe.

1414
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:09,949
Breathe, come on.

1415
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,620
Get him into the ward
as fast as you can.

1416
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,185
Come on.

1417
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,321
Okay, Vernon.

1418
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:16,674
- Steady.
- It's okay, Vernon.

1419
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:19,827
- You'll be all right.
- Come on, quick, lads.

1420
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,234
One, two, three.
Lift.

1421
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:23,932
Steady.

1422
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,804
It's okay, Vernon.
It's okay. We're here.

1423
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,343
Come on.

1424
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,776
That's it.
Stay calm.

1425
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,541
Did he take something?
Who did this to him?

1426
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,104
Come on.

1427
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:52,366
Gotcha!

1428
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,573
Come on, Gary.

1429
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,633
This is ridiculous.
You know the rules.

1430
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,621
Every prisoner must list
his personal possessions.

1431
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,204
This is a bloody CD player,

1432
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,258
and it is not on Vernon Black's
list of possessions.

1433
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,375
It never was on his list,

1434
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:11,443
because you know and I know
it was Michael Winchwood's.

1435
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,064
Now, you were part
of that strip search,

1436
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:15,319
so who is covering up for who?

1437
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,983
I'm not covering up for anybody.

1438
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:19,425
Somebody is.
At least admit you'll know that.

1439
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,258
No, I don't know that.

1440
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:26,000
You are aware by now that there
could be a murder inquiry.

1441
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:30,269
This is your opportunity
to come clean with me, Gary.

1442
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,864
I have nothing to hide.

1443
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:34,569
Good.

1444
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,771
In the meantime,
I want a list of names

1445
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:38,609
of every single officer
on that strip search.

1446
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,012
I want the names
of every officer

1447
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:42,414
by Vernon Black's cell
before he was beaten.

1448
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,976
- Beaten?
- Beaten.

1449
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,544
He's also an arsonist,

1450
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,381
and if I find out
that he was not in his cell

1451
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,301
the night of the riots,
then he will be a witness.

1452
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,794
Plot thickens.
With me?

1453
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:53,920
Good night.

1454
01:28:58,967 --> 01:28:59,991
What's going on?

1455
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:03,800
I want the list of who was
on duty in C right now.

1456
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:06,307
You know Vernon Black's
in hospital?

1457
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,442
I talk to you,
and they'll kill me.

1458
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,143
Murphy and Jellings
will kill me.

1459
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:54,280
Who are you more
afraid of, Vernon?

1460
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:58,384
Murphy and Jellings
or certain prison officers?

1461
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,827
I fell down the stairs.

1462
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,895
I can't protect you

1463
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,231
unless you tell me
who you're afraid of.

1464
01:30:07,302 --> 01:30:11,296
Just tell me the truth, Vernon,
and no one will hurt you.

1465
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:15,037
I saw him.

1466
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:37,930
It's... It isn't
the way you think.

1467
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,126
I can explain.

1468
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,260
I just...

1469
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:44,329
We want to talk to you.
Please.

1470
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:58,886
Cigarette?

1471
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,946
I don't smoke.

1472
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:04,789
Well, Michael Winchwood
used to taunt us,

1473
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:07,488
taunt the other prisoners.

1474
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,394
He's been made out to be
some kind of victim,

1475
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,834
but in reality the man was
a perverted, twisted bastard!

1476
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:16,235
He wasn't like
the other segregated nonces.

1477
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,241
He was always sort of gloating,
like he was somehow superior,

1478
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,800
playing his classical music,
his opera.

1479
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,608
- Get to the point.
- Tom's got two kids.

1480
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:30,118
Winchwood used to keep on
about what he'd do to them.

1481
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:33,587
I was bathing my little boy,

1482
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,682
and I drew the curtains 'cause
I didn't want anyone to see me

1483
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:39,125
holding me own little boy.

1484
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:41,129
That's what Winchwood did to me.

1485
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:43,893
We just wanted to shut him up,
make him scared.

1486
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,332
We knew we couldn't do it.

1487
01:31:48,136 --> 01:31:50,469
So you used Murphy and Jellings.

1488
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,474
We wanted to talk to you,
to tell you, ask you if you'd...

1489
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,635
Look...

1490
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,475
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me, and the answer is no.

1491
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,745
There's been enough covering up.

1492
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:04,217
If Murphy and Jellings
killed Winchwood,

1493
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:07,619
then he has a right to justice.

1494
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:08,987
Or his family does.

1495
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:11,424
He deserved all he got!

1496
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:14,088
We just wanted to teach him
a lesson, nothing more.

1497
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:17,291
Oh, but it was more, wasn't it?
It was a lot more.

1498
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,411
Governor Langham covered up
for you, didn't he?

1499
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,875
No?

1500
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,779
What about Gary Marshall?
Did he know?

1501
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,474
Did he?

1502
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:45,258
These are the self-confessed
officers involved,

1503
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:47,818
Officers O'Keefe and Doughen.

1504
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,660
But they didn't act alone.

1505
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,495
Also involved in the events
of that night

1506
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,728
were Officers Jensen,
Smith, Mallard.

1507
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:54,667
They're all named.

1508
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,364
I'll leave you
to make your own decision

1509
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:58,031
regarding
Deputy Governor Gary Marshall,

1510
01:32:58,106 --> 01:33:00,405
as he is not yet privy
to this information.

1511
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,880
Prisoners Anthony Murphy

1512
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:06,744
and Douglas Jellings'
case histories,

1513
01:33:06,815 --> 01:33:11,253
and lastly Vernon Black's
tape recording.

1514
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,947
May I play this now?

1515
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:18,288
This was actually recorded

1516
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:21,955
on Michael Winchwood's
own cassette player.

1517
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,896
<i>When Murphy and Jellings
was brought in,</i>

1518
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:25,991
<i>I was in the kitchen area.</i>

1519
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:28,764
<i>Officers O'Keefe and Doughen
gave them the nod.</i>

1520
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,290
Lockup.
Back to your cells.

1521
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,988
Come on.
Lockup.

1522
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,428
Get back in your cells.

1523
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:34,032
Lockup, lockup.
Get back in your cells.

1524
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:39,637
Come on, lads.
Right now.

1525
01:34:59,294 --> 01:35:01,388
- Okay?
- Now.

1526
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,348
Get in your cell, Black!

1527
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,014
Lockup!

1528
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,927
Stay out of it.
Right?

1529
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:58,419
Ooooh.

1530
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:01,081
Ooooh.

1531
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,020
Ooooh.

1532
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,921
Ooooh.

1533
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:36,653
Lockup secure on landing.

1534
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,360
Oi, Doughen!

1535
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,259
<i>I didn't start no fire</i>

1536
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:30,195
<i>but the one in the VP kitchen.</i>

1537
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:33,564
<i>'Cause I hate the animals
in there.</i>

1538
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,536
<i>But I never did anything
to Michael Winchwood.</i>

1539
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:40,234
<i>Murphy and Officers O'Keefe
and Doughen</i>

1540
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:42,641
<i>agreed to say nothing about it.</i>

1541
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:46,477
<i>They gave me the stereo.
I-I didn't nick it.</i>

1542
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:48,277
<i>Then they tried to
take it off me.</i>

1543
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,151
<i>They beat me up.</i>

1544
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:59,089
Thank you, Miss Hewitt.

1545
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:04,092
I think we would now like
to discuss these developments.

1546
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:06,760
You have been very tenacious.

1547
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,669
Please would you leave
the tape recording?

1548
01:40:12,874 --> 01:40:16,140
There is a copy in the file,
plus a written transcript.

1549
01:40:23,084 --> 01:40:24,017
Thank you.

1550
01:40:24,085 --> 01:40:26,645
Miss Hewitt, can you
tell me what it feels like

1551
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:29,247
to be taking on
the notorious Barfield Prison?

1552
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:32,054
It's a challenge, and I know
it will be hard work.

1553
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:33,424
But as the new investigation

1554
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:35,588
into the death of
Michael Winchwood proves,

1555

01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,043
Yes, I am.

1562
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:51,855
Miss Hewitt, can you look
this way, please?

1563
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,279
Miss Hewitt.
