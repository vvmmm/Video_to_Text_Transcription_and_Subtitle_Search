wasn't there?

00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,780
Yes, he threatened me.

92
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,092
He said he knew where I lived

93
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,675
and he would always
be able to find me.

103
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,884
Miss Hewitt, do you believe
that more government support

104
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,537
is given to the criminal
than to the victim?

105
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,972
Every victim
has a right to justice.

106
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,279
Of course they do.
But that is not my job.

107
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,080
That is the job
of the law courts.

108
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,452
My job is to ensure that the
perpetrators are rehabilitated

109
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,252
so that when they leave prison,

110
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,668
they are no longer
a threat to society.

SMITH:
But it doesn't work.

112
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,253
The man who raped me
raped another woman

113
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,488
six months after his release.

114
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,140
Well, considering the cost
to keep a prisoner

115
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,531

it's not surprising...

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,397
Why doesn't the government

117
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,145
spend more money on the victims
and not the criminals?

118
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,638
The main costs are
to ensure total security,

119
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,472
so that a prisoner cannot escape
and endanger the public.

120
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,307
I-I do understand
and feel for the victims,

such as Miss Smith,

122
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,674
and of course,
they should be cared for,

123
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,273
but there are
at this present time

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,286
over 50,000 men in prison.

125
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,353
We cannot operate

126
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,998
a "lock them up
and throw away the key" regime,

127
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,991
which achieves
absolutely nothing.

128
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,890
We must at all costs
rehabilitate them

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,003
so that they do not reoffend.

130
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,258
Sarah, did you receive
any compensation?

131
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,764
Â£2,500.

132
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,029
Â£2,500.

133
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,592
It's a very small amount
in comparison

134
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,106
with the estimated Â£40 million
worth of damage done

135
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,869
during the recent riots
at Barfield.

136
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,910
Surely if the intention
was to rehabilitate

137
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,969
the men held there,
then it failed.

138
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,885
The comfort, or the
softly, softly" approach...

139
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,711
I've no intention of applying
a soft approach

140
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,715
to my term as governor.

141
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,115
In today's paper
it was announced

142
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:29,452
that Barfield has been allocated
Â£60 million for the rebuild.

143
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,458
Surely this is
an astronomical amount of money.

144
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,585
I have not been informed
as to the exact amount

145
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,856
to be allocated to Barfield.

146
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,263
Really?
It was in <i>The Independent</i> today.

147
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,131
Perhaps this is an indication
of mismanagement.

148
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:47,106
Sadly, yet again, the victims
of crime seem to be the losers.

149
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,039
Was anyone at Barfield informed?

150
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,101
MAN: Yes. There was
e-mail notification.

151
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,544
How could it possibly
get leaked to the press

152
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,924
without prior consultation
with me?

153
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,417
I can't say, but it must
have come from HQ.

154
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,952
I would like to see those plans.

155
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,386
Yes, I know you
are my area manager,

156
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,821
but don't you think that since
I am the governor in charge,

157
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,552
I may possibly have
some suggestions?

00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,625
I'll arrange it.

159
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,220
As you're in London,
say, half an hour?

160
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,424
That's absolutely fine.
I'll be there.

161
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,562
Has anyone from Barfield
been shown these designs?

162
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,230
I really wouldn't know.
I'm just the architect.

163
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,673
Well, it would make sense
to ask people working there

164
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,471
for their input, wouldn't it?

165
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,810
Well, I have only had dealings
with the prison authorities.

166
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,477
The new priority
is to be the plumbing.

167
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,319
Stainless steel toilets
and wash basins to each cell.

168
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,523
These men spend 12 hours a day
inside these cells.

169
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,120
They also eat
all of their meals in there.

170
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,598
It is totally insanitary.

171
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,696
What's this?

172
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,499
A proposed football pitch.

173
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,005
AstroTurf.

174
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,043
AstroTurf?

175
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,273
Well, no wonder
it's costing 60 million.

176
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,338
This a swimming pool, is it?

177
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,942
This is proposed to be built
inside the new larger perimeter,

178
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,079
and is a complete secure unit.

179
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,419
Is it an SSU or a control unit?

180
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,085
A sort of prison
within the prison.

181
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,890
[Cellphone rings]

182
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,761
You mean a secure unit,
Mr. Greenleaves.

183
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,233
In America,
it is nicknamed the "cage,"

184
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,394
but from your design,

185
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,701
it resembles
a four-star YMCA hostel.

186
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,001
- Yes.
- Miss Hewitt?

187
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,508
- Speaking.
- [Speaking indistinctly]

188
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,238
No, I don't care
what his solicitor says.

189
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,577
I want Maynard cuffed to an
officer throughout that hearing.

190
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,808
MAN: Without more time

191
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,681
we were unable
to accommodate your request.

192
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,713
What the hell
am I paying you two for?

193
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,054
There's no way they can freeze
those accounts, is there?

194
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,526
Mr. Maynard, it's gone
beyond that stage.

195
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,257
- You're being charged.
- I'm a declared bankrupt.

196
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,095
They can charge me
with what the hell they like.

197
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,260
How much? Hey?
Now, come on, you two.

198
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,201
How much
are they trying to get me for?

199
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,968
It's not just the Inland Revenue
and value added tax.

200
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,068
Transporting anything
is a very costly business.

201
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:08,206
Well, there must be a way
to salvage the original plan.

202
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,341
I don't care what it costs.

203
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,946
Now, look, this building here
is under construction.

204
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,990
And this one too.

205
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,424
Now, are you telling me

206
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,291
that there's no way
to get access to this area?

207
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,092
We might get 'round it,
but it will cost.

208
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,360
WOMAN: Mr. Maynard is solicited
to court two.

209
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,232
- Are they ready for the hearing?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,100
Oh!
Trying to clean me out.

211
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,766
Let's go.

212
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,433
There's no way that we can, uh,

213
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,553
get rid of these for
the hearing, is there, you know?

214
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,671
I mean, they know
I've been nicked, you know?

215
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,374
No need to overplay your hand,
you know,

216
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,417
and lose the sympathy vote,
is there?

217
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,386
How much?
Five grand? Ten?

218
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,013
No? 20?

219
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,253
Final offer... 30 large.

220
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,692
[Chuckles]
Just joking.

221
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,722
Can you do it?

222
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,995
I'm gonna have to find
one hell of a pilot.

223
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,768
- Mr. Morgan...
- Later, son.

224
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,843
You must be the new lad
from Pentonville.

225
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,991
I'm the senior officer
on C Wing.

226
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,348
- Russell Morgan.
- James Malahide. Jimmy.

227
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,818
So, what made you sign up, then?

228
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,651
I was in the services.
Couldn't settle into civvies.

229
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,122
My wife's just had a baby.

230
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,682
Ah, 14 years 3 Para, me.

231
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,319
A period is one hour,
9:30 to 10:30.

232
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,456
We keep them coming.
Unless it rains.

233
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,966
Good morning, Stanley.

234
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,661
Your governor coming back then,
is he?

235
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,727
Why, yours not?

236
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,898
Did you see her
on TV this morning?

237
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,442
Not exactly what you'd call
"Baywatch" material, is she?

238
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,375
[Laughs]

239
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,310
That's Edward Maynard's runner.

240
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,190
Carries all his messages
backwards and forwards,

241
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,546
sort of like a ferret.

242

Other chap is Harry Reynolds,
lifer.

243

Cigarette?
You know who I am.

244
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,617
Ex-RAF, aren't you?
Mr. Maynard needs some advice.

245
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,820
Do you reckon Maynard
will come back?

246
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:02,895
Yeah.

247
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,373
These big mothers
look after Maynard.

248
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,797
Day off for them today.

249
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,699
- Mr. Morgan.
- I said later, son.

250
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,895
That's Roddy Marsh.

251
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,403
He ate his grandmother,
didn't he?

252
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,497
Aye.
He's a vegetarian now.

253

All right, son.
We'll settle it.

Go on, then.

You watch your step, Marky.

- What's with that guy?
- Oh, he's harmless enough.

Just keeps on
getting over the wall.

267

We've got to keep him
in the sheltered area

till he learns some sense.

269

Don't they have those stripes
in Pentonville, then?

Oh, yeah. Just never
seen them used, that's all.

271
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,855
Oh, you don't see them
used much these days.

272

Bloody prison watchdogs reckon
they're too humiliating.

273
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,818
Yeah, but I was told that

274

there'd be no loss
of me privileges,

275

just 21 days punishment.

276

Hang about.
You're doing four years, right?

277
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,526
- Yeah.
- You lost 21 days.

278

So you're telling me you're
going out on your old date?

Yeah, man.

280
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,469
But what about you doing chokey
for head-butting that screw?

281
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,102
You get 21 days, right?

282
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,340
Yeah, they just said
me time went on pause.

283
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,281
Well, if your time went on
pause, when did it start again?

284
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,613
When I got back to me pad.

285
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,620
No way.
You got 21 days extra.

286
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,622
They got to be doubled.

and you say your time
did not go on pause,

and you say none of your
privileges were taken away,

you should be entitled to them.

Yeah.

at the end of your EDR.

What you've got to do
is ask them to explain.

312
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,586
Ask the S.O.

313
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,251
Mr. Morgan, can I have a word?

314
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,693
Inside, Brian.
Go on.

315
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,596
So, now you've met some of
the players, what do you think?

316
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,293
Okay.
I think I can handle it.

317
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,531
Mr. Morgan, there's something
going down... big.

318
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,334
- I think it's a delivery.
- Bugger off, son.

319

Welcome to Barfield.

I didn't.

325
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,425
Oh, Mavis, um, was there any
kind of press release from HQ?

326
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,025
I'll check the fax machine.

327
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,399
Everything okay?

328
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,960
You missed your rounds
this morning.

329
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,871
Mr. Lyons isn't here, but I've
shown young Malahide the ropes.

330

the new officer?

332
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,302
Yep. I think
he'll settle in all right.

333
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,312
Mm-hmm.

334
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,110
Prisoner 435, Jack Bulmer,

335

has complained
that he has lost phone cards,

336
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,246
two one-ounce packets
of tobacco,

337
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,413
a Game Boy, four games,

338
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,822
a Sony Walkman, and some tapes.

339
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,485
I also got a good informant
on the wing.

340
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,071
He seems to think
something's coming in.

341
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,860
Like what?
Dixons opening a branch?

342
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,108
Anyway, I put it in my report.

343
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,260
Lad sometime makes stuff up.

344
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,803
Mr. Marshall coming back, is he?

345
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,271
I've not been informed by HQ.

346
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,832
But then, I wasn't privy
to the press release

347
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,709
about the refurbishment costs
either.

348
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,339
Is that true? They're gonna
spend 60 million on this place?

349
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,441
I really have no idea.

350
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,951
It was in <i>The Independent.</i>

351
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,530
We recorded
the breakfast show in the club.

352
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,580
I bet you did, Mr. Morgan.

353
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,818
I had five phone cards.

354
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,621
And Mark, next pad,

355
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,219
he asked me if he can borrow
one of my phone cards.

356
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,307
I tell him no because I know
he won't pay me for it.

357
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,890
Right?

358
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,458
I come back from association
last night,

359
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,504
and my pad's been cleaned out.

360
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,006
And this morning, on exercise,

361
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,838
I heard a rumor
that somebody in D Wing

362
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,241
has been offered one,

363
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,440
and someone in this
wing's been offered one too.

364
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,506
It's really got me down,
Miss Hewitt.

365
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,576
I mean, that Game Boy's worth
at least 15 phone cards.

366
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,450
All right, Jack.
I'll see what I can do.

367
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,456
But you know it's against
prison regulations

368
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,389
to do these trade-offs.

369
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,324
Okay?

371

Now, Webster.

372
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,891
You've made him
a 4:00 p.m. dental appointment.

373
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,900
MORGAN: That's right.

374
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,561
- Morning, Gov.
- Morning.

375
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,069
- Morning, Gov.
- Uh, morning.

376
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,129
What time's Dr. Thomas due?

377
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,734
2:00.
But Webster needs a dentist.

378
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,050
I think we should have a new
arrangement with the doctor.

379
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,389
I mean, as things
stand at the moment,

380
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,813
if the inmates want to see him,
they have to wait until 2:00.

381
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,578
So?

382
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,209
It clashes
with their visiting times.

383
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,263
If they have to see the doc,
then they miss their visit,

384
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,586
and they won't miss their visit.

385
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,421
Okay. Point taken.
Thank you.

386

as soon as possible, please.

Can I take a message?

No, I'd like to
speak to him personally.

this afternoon.

00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,433
Do you wish to make a complaint
against anyone?

933
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,661
No.

934
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,049
You will lose your privileges
for a month,

935
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,668
and 21 days will be
added onto your sentence.

936
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,109
Yes, miss.
Thank you, miss.

937
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,593
You will also lose the privilege

938
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,912
of exercising
with the other inmates.

939
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,647
You'll be exercised in the yard,
alone, though under supervision,

940
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,315
and for at least three quarters
of an hour a day.

941
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,060
Punishment?

942
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,686
Don't let me down.

943
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,869
Stop tugging at me.
You're driving me nuts.

944
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,534
Is it going down?
I've done everything for you.

945
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:47,875
- I'm with you, aren't I?
- Shut up.

946
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,710
Well, come on!
Give it to me straight.

947
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,647
I told you yesterday!

948
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,380
You get an extra three months,
you prat!

949
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,854
Three months?
Bastard!

950
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,084
[Laughs]

951
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,496
I heard Webster come back
with the gov.

952
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,631
He got out to give her a fuck.
That's what I was told.

953
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:16,833
Yeah.

954
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,537
He's running a bit of a risk,
isn't he?

955
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,989
I'm going to be moved, aren't I?
I know.

956
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,691
You accused Mark Lewis
of stealing certain items.

957
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,133
Are these the belongings
that were stolen from your cell?

958
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,638
He did it at 6:45
on Tuesday's association.

959
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,675
I know because
I went to make a phone call.

960
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,243
But nobody actually saw him
entering your cell,

961
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,611
so how can you be sure?

962
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:59,651
Because he wanted
some Sellotape.

963
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:00,980
I said he could get it.

964
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:03,647
I saw him going in
as I went down the landing.

965
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:07,590
But you didn't actually see
your things in Mark Lewis' cell.

966
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,857
The next day at lunch, I'm told
by someone that Oswald Snooper

967
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,831
was offered a Game Boy
by Mark Lewis,

968
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,232
so it had to be him.

969
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,032
So you took the law
into your own hands.

970
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,801
I never touched
one of the bosses, ma'am.

971
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,501
I never touched one of them.

972
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,976
I will take that
into consideration,

973
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,240
and your previous good behavior,

974
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,713
and the fact
that you were provoked.

975
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,717
But I cannot condone
such violence,

976
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,275
so obviously
you will be punished.

977
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,654
But you will get your belongings
returned to you eventually.

978
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:44,128
You put me back on the wing
with him, and he'll kill me.

979
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,063
Mark Lewis will be transferred
from Barfield.

980
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,603
I owe you, Miss Hewitt.

981
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,196
And as I'm down here,
no one will know.

982
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,537
Rumor is there's going to be
a delivery.

983
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,772
They're wrong.
It's a collection.

Oh, my God.

986
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,852
It's a helicopter.
Get the alarms on!

987
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,656
Don't move yet.
