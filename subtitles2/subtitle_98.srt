00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,747
Still mad because Starling
kicked your butt?

3
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,328
She did not kick my butt.

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,921
I might've kinda sorta lost
to Starling

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,765
and now my fury over it
consumes my entire existence.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,624
What are you doing
with Starling's autograph?

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,018
And how does she know
who you are?

You're Chaos.

Promise you won't tell my family
about this, especially Amy.

Starling, look out.

11
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,569
You just saved her life.

12
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,054
Could I maybe get your number?

13
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:25,805
I should probably take
yours too, you know,

just to make sure you're
staying on the right path.

Okay. Sounds good.

Yeah, talk soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

Hey, Jake.

20
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,717
Were you just talking to
who I think you were talking to?

21
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,287
Yup. Starling.

00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,142
HARTLEY: Starling?

23
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,013
Oh. Well, I thought it was
the middle aged guy

24
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,234
from tech support who you
oddly became friends with.

25
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,018
Dennis?
No, I talked to him earlier.

26
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,499
Good news, I convinced him
to ditch the hairpiece

27
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,885
and embrace the bald.

28
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,238
Well, did Starling ask about me?

29
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,624
Not by name but she did tell me
to say hi to my weird friend.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,706
That means she remembered me.

31
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,731
We've been talking every day

32
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,211
since we went
to our commercial shoot.

33
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,996
And tonight, she wants
to meet up in person.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,172
Oh my gosh, tonight?
Really?

35
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,522
Oh, that's amazing.
What am I gonna wear?

36
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,966
Well, how about pajamas?
Because you're staying home.

37
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,396
This is the first chance
Starling and I

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,398
have had to hang out alone
and I wanna make it special.

39
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,922
So we're going to a junkyard.

Sounds romantic.

41
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,529
Was the sewage plant
all booked up?

42
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,438
It's special because that's
where we had our first battle.

43
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,889
I threw a rusted out engine
block at her

44
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:46,726
and she stopped it midair
and threw it right back at me.

45
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,975
It was magical.

46
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,632
But anyway, I need you
to cover for me with my parents,

47
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:54,429
and more importantly Amy.

48
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,898
Oh, no.

49
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,510
I already feel guilty
about keeping a secret from her.

50
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,429
She's my best friend and she
wouldn't keep secrets from me.

51
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,921
- Yeah, she would.
- Yeah. You're probably right.

52
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,651
But I don't like
doing it to her.

53
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,044
Neither do I.

54
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,133
I'm not gonna keep
this from her forever,

55
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,093
just until I can find a way

56
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,096
to make her see
the Starling that I see.

You know, the one she won't
wanna toss off a tall building.

Fine.

59

But the stress of keeping
this secret is getting to me.

I'm starting to lose my hair.

I mean, the shower drain
looks like it's wearing a wig.

Come on,
you can stay for dinner.

63
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,583
And do you mind
wearing a hairnet?

64
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,857
I don't know what's going on.

But I'm gonna find out.

00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,136
He's old.

160
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,219
Probably wouldn't
even know it's gone.

161
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,535
I'll wait with you, Colby.

162
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,840
Do you want anything?

163
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,929
Yeah. Actually,
I'm kind of thirsty.

164
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,751
Could you grab me that water?

165
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,408
Oh. No, no, no, no.

166
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,892
What kind of evil lair
doesn't have paper towels?

167
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,072
Oh, no.

168
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,646
What's wrong?

169
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,076
Why do I sound like this?

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,521
And why do I feel
taller and thicker?

171
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,692
I've got bigger everything.

172
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,832
I think the water
shorted out the console

173
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,052
and it made you older.

174
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,792
Look.

175
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,620
That's me?

176
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:28,182
Whoa. I'm a major hottie.

177
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,235
Yeah. I mean, no.

178
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,627
I mean, ew. [Chuckles]

179
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,841
I mean, I gotta fix this.

180
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,199
[beeping]

181
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:42,724
Come on, dumb machine,
turn it back.

182
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,379
Good idea, Hartley.
If things take a bad turn,

183
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:47,164
just start hitting
random buttons.

184
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,464
[beeping]

185
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,033
Is it working?

186
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,262
Why do I feel the sudden urge
to second guess my life choices

187
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,997
and spend all my savings
on a sports car?

188
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,532
Probably because of this?

189
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,751
[groans] Now I'm old.

190
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,927
What happened to the hottie?

191
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,407
I know.

192
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,148
His eyes were so dark
and soulful,

193
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,970
I could just get lost in them.

194
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,365
I'm just gonna keep
pressing buttons.

195
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:24,897
[upbeat music playing]

196
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,727
[dog barking]

197
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,120
Sorry, I'm late.

198
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,991
Probably should've chosen
a junkyard

199
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,993
with less angry guard dogs.

200
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,343
I thought they were
kind of sweet.

201
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,128
But then again,
everyone's sweet to me

202
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,907
because, you know, superhero.

203
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,389
- It's good to see you again.
- You too.

204
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:50,096
So, now what do we do?

205
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,398
I thought we were gonna go get
ice cream but this is a choice.

206
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,711
Come on, we had our first
battle in the junkyard.

207
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:57,973
I was being sentimental.

208
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,758
We also fought
on a tropical island.

209
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,493
We could've met there.

210
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:05,764
What was that?

211
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,418
The dogs are back

212
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,109
and they can smell my fear.

213
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,817
[tense music playing]

214
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,210
Amy.

215
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,598
Guess I didn't get the invite.

216
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:28,084
[upbeat music playing]

217
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:30,919
Jake, get away from her.

218
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,617
How'd you know I was here?

219
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,966
I overheard your conversation
with Hartley.

220
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,750
You're lucky I got here
just in time.

221
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,969
In time for what?

222
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,362
To save you.

223
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,841
I'm sorry, who are you?

224
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,756
- His sister.
- Wait.

225
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,194
You're Havoc?

226
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,320
Girl, you had me fooled.

227
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,677
- Amy, I can explain.
- AMY: No need.

228
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,766
At first, I was upset
but then I thought

229
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,594
of course I can
trust my brother.

230
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,641
He'd never meet with my nemesis
behind my back on purpose.

231
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:59,426
I mean, supervillains
don't hang out with superheroes.

232
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,038
She's clearly taking advantage
of nice guy Jake for one reason,

233
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:04,779
to lure you into a trap.

234
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,433
It's not a trap.

235
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,696
And you know who'd say that?
A person setting a trap.

236
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,830
[grunts]

237
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,353
Well, if you're gonna
start something,

238
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,833
I'm gonna end it.

239
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,965
- Not this time.
- Stop fighting.

240
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,266
You're gonna attract the dogs.

241
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,932
There's one advantage
I've always had over you, Havoc.

242
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,717
I can fly and you're stuck
on the ground.

243
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,060
That's where you're wrong.

244
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,282
Whoa.

245
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,160
When did you learn
how to do that?

246
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,330
Just now.
Lucky for me it worked.

247
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,250
[grunts]

248
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:50,906
Starling.

249
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,998
Yup.
Still working on the landing.

250
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,703
Jake, get out of the way.

251
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,835
No, Amy.
This has gone way too far.

252
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,098
AMY: I mean it, Jake.
Get out of the way.

253
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,840
It's time for me to finish this.

254
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,880

255
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,013
Amy!

[upbeat music playing]

257
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:19,201
Aging 30 years in a day
has me so confused.

258
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:22,764
I don't know whether to play
Little League or coach it.

259
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,774
[gasps] There you are.
Where have you been?

260
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,037
Well, Gara's retirement
bash got canceled,

261
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,865
so we had to improvise

262
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,780
and steal a cake from some
kid's birthday party.

263
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,734
Won't be a happy birthday
for you, Johnny.

264
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,829
Who's this?

265
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,912
It's me, Colby.

266
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,661
- What?
- Oh, no.

267
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,880
I kind of spilled
on your console

268
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,839
and then everything sparked

269
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,710
and then he turned 20 and then
I started pressing more buttons

270
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,011
and then he turned into that.

271
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,934
Mom, can you please
make me a sandwich?

272
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,408
And don't forget
to cut off the crust.

273
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,374
It is Colby.

274
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,897
My son is older than me.

275
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,551
Fix this.

276
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:06,031
I'm on it.

277
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:07,592
I'll be in the lair.

278
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,246
Hello, Celia.

279
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,474
Robert, you really
don't have a problem

280
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,346
with your lady just waltzing
into tenant's homes?

281

Hey.

282
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:18,870
I may be the chief of police

283
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,960
but she's the chief
of everything else.

284

Taught him that
on our first date.

285
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,879
What are you doing here,
grandma?

286
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,709
I came to tell you that Robert
and I are going dancing.

287
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,798
Salsa dancing.

288
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,277
Things are gonna get
hot tonight.

289
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:36,757
Okay.

290
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,760
Now you two have fun,
and then bye.

291
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,016
Who's this?

292
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:44,156
You don't have someone else
living here, do you?

293
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,810
- No, he's actually...
- The plumber.

294
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,551
[chuckles] He's a plumber.

295
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:48,813
That's his job.

296
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,423
That's what he does
for a living.

297
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,985
Yup. He plumbs.

298
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,776
I know you're new at lying

299
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,033
but that was more lie
than we needed.

300
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,825
I didn't call a plumber.

301
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,479
It was an emergency.

302
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,568
A leaky faucet emergency.

303
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,215
Why didn't you call me?

304
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:10,182
Because I knew you were getting
ready for your date with Robert.

305
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,227
Oh, okay.

306
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,707
Did I mention
we're going salsa dancing?

307
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,709
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,755
Hold on a minute.

309
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,839
If you're a plumber, let me see
your plumber's license.

310
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,717
- You can't.
- Why not?

311
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,938
Because I left it
back at the shop.

312
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,809
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,057
There's a ring of scam artists
around town

314
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,466
pretending to be plumbers
to swindle money out of people

315
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,859
and he could be one of them.

316
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:38,558
No one scams me
or my granddaughter.

317
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:41,126

that's why.

Starling gave me a reason to.

No, it didn't start out
that way.

00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,691
Hey, Amy.

477
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,948
Where were you?
I've been texting you for hours.

478
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,827
Don't.

479
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,082
I know everything.

480
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,051
Oh, I've been at the junkyard
with Jake and Starling.

481
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,879
Oh, boy.

482
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,881
How could you keep this
all a secret from me?

483
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:14,361
Look, I'm sorry.

484
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,189
I was just trying
to protect everyone.

485
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:17,887
Jake is my friend too.

486
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:21,542
And when a friend asks
to keep a secret, I do it.

487
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,762
You know,

488
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:25,807
for the first time
in my life, I thought

489
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,375
I actually made a real friend.

490
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:31,197
Someone who'd be there
for me, have my back.

491
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:35,332
But you're just as bad as Jake.

492
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,291
Amy, please.

493
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,207
I didn't even wanna keep
this secret at all.

494
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,593
But you did.

495
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,559
You know, I never wanted
a best friend in the first place

496
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,337
and...

497
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,861
now I know why.

498
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,566
She knows.

499
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,531
Yeah.

500
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:03,920
Well, how do we fix this?

501
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,140
Honestly, Hartley...

502
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:09,969
I don't know if we can.

503

[dramatic music playing]

504
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,900
Well, Colby,
the good news is I am a genius

505
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:23,728
and I'll find a way
to get you back.

506
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,556
The bad news is you'll have
to wait until Friday

507
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,079
so you can buy us movie tickets

508
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,162
with your
senior citizen discount.

509
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,911
We'll need you
to buy us popcorn.

510
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,870
We'd share it with you

511
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,953
but it might get stuck
in your dentures.

512
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:39,440
Hey.

513
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,311
At least now
I'm old enough to drive.

514
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,395
Oh, now you're too old to drive.

515
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,491
That's a bummer.

516
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,923
Well, at least
I'm old enough to drive.

517
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,361
Oh, sweetie.

518
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,277
Why don't you take a nap?

519
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,069
Come on.

520
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:02,035
Don't forget
to take his teeth out.
