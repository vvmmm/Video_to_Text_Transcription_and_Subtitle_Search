Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:08,269
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,401
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,810
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,281
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,012
Lockup!
Lockup!

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,762
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,847
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,289
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,692
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,286
Bastards.

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,231
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,424
Ah, no!

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,696
You talk to him...

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,331
and you're dead.

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,033
Your moaning and your whingeing.

17
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,167
You'll be sick
when I'm gone, Eugene Buffy!

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,904
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,922
You'll be sick about me too,
because in two weeks, I gone.

20
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:49,178
I've got a visitor.
It's me dad.

21
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,581
I want to see me dad.

22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,022
Snoopy?

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,668
I'm sorry you've been left
hanging about.

24
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,389
Ohh, you've been
asking for this.

25
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,020
Aah!

26
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:03,859
Oh!

27
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,524
I can sing.
I can sing that!

28
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,534
I was mistaken.

29
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,433
Nothing happened.

30
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,734
You obviously haven't spoken
to Mr. Andrews.

31
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,274
Well, I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

32
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,741
but as from 9:00 tomorrow,

33
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,870
I am the official governor
of Barfield Prison.

Brian.

37
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,696
I wanted to see you
before your release.

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,930
I've got all me documents.

00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,324
Me brother's coming
to pick me up.

00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,307
Wanted to wish you luck, Brian.

41
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,706
Nice one. Cheers.

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,573
Now, you know your restrictions?

43
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,684
Yeah, I'm gonna go straight
to me probation officer,

44
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,841
and he's gonna help me
further me education.

45
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:55,780
Keep it up, Brian.

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,818
- Cheers.
- Good luck.

47
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,462
See you, lads.
I'm going for a bevvy.

48
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,122
I'm out.

49
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,660
Free!
I'm out!

50
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,253
Yes, man!
Whoo-hoo!

51
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,127
Release my brother!

52
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,429
Release my brother!

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,695
Yes, Brian.

54
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,737
Release that man!

55
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,930
Free, brother!

56
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,439
Free at last!

57
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,273
Free at last!
Free at last!

58
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,908
Come on, now.
Trolley's on the wing.

59
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,852
Come on, Eugene. It's not like
you to be late down for lunch.

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,286
The trolley's on the wing.

61
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,550
Nah, I'm not hungry, gov.

62
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,489
You're not sick, are you?

63
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,658
I'm just not hungry.
Can you go away?

64
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,721
All right.
Suit yourself.

65
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,701
What's up with you, Kevin?
You're not hungry either?

66
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,773
No.

67
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,110
Everybody done?
Hully?

68
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,647
- Yeah, all done.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,853
Hello, Eugene.

70
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,922
It's hamburgers today.

71
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,289
Eh, did you hear the musical's
not gonna be scrapped?

72
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,622
It's great, isn't it?

73
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,322
Piss off.

74
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,693
Ja-son!

75
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,866
Ja-son!

76
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,104
Ja-son!

77
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,874
Come on, back to your cell.

78
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,314
Eugene Buffy and Kevin Watts,
not hungry.

79
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,908
And what's up with you?

80
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,475
That little shit
keeps this up...

81
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,920
- He's at it all day long.
- Who's at what?

82
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,082
Keith Smith,
keeps on calling out my name.

83
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,956
Oh, well, if that's all
you got worrying you, sunshine.

84
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,859
We've got three new inmates
due over.

85
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,898
- Ignore it, right?
- Oh, shit, they're here now.

86
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,728
Right, get everybody
back in the cells.

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,028
Come on, gents.

88
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,797
<i>Move along back to your cells.</i>

89
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,464
<i>Stop chattering.
Come along.</i>

90
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,234
You might have
all the time in the world.

91
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,318
- Unfortunately, I don't.
<i>- Back to your cell, please.</i>

92
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,402
Keep moving.
Morning, Malcolm.

93
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,883
Now, I want to work towards

94
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,084
making one wing
entirely drug-free.

95
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,094
You must be joking.

96
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,721
The only way you'll make
a prison drug free

97
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,028
is to stop
all visitation rights.

98
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,761
That'd do it.

99
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,066
- Glad to have you back with us.
- Thank you, Len.

100
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,698
Good to be back.

101
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,342
Thanks.

102
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,403
You had a call
from a Mr. Ishmail

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,346
and one from a Mr. Simon Lennox.

104
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,316
Oh, did he say
what it was about?

105
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,751
He wanted an appointment
for tomorrow.

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,844
Simon.

107
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,184
No, Mr. Ishmail.

108
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,019
Mavis, I have told you,
if somebody calls,

109
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,337
try to find out what it's about.

110
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,853
- At least find out who they are.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,888
That's it for now.

112
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,997
Um, I think Mr. Ishmail
is a lawyer.

113
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,768
And I'll check on Simon Lennox.

114
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,571
Simon Lennox is also a lawyer,

115
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,080
as well as my partner,
boyfriend, lover.

116
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,910
You don't need <i>his</i> number, then.

117
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,850
Yes, I did, Mavis,
because he's in Australia.

118
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,911
I'll make a note of that.

119
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,334
All right, Barry?

120
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,099
Right, I'm gonna be around if
you want to ask any questions.

121
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,639
Kevin here
will show you the ropes.

122
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,504
- Did you get some lunch?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,175
Right, well, it's lockup now
for an hour,

124
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,542
and then we open up again.

125
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,603
And I'll take you through
any workshop details

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,191
and any classes
you might want to sign up for.

127
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,980
- All right, son?
- Great. Thank you, sir.

128
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,292
Not as bad as I thought
it was gonna be in here.

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,226
Bit like a YMCA.

130
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,319
What are you in for?

131
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,762
I'm on remand, waiting for
me solicitor to come and see me.

132
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,049
He reckons I might get off
'cause there was something wrong

133
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,150
with the way they arrested me.

134
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,769
Hey!
I'm not interested.

135
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,812
I don't want to hear about some
petty little shit

136
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,816
who reckons he's at Butlin's,
all right?

137
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,253
Is it all right
if I put this up?

138
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,812
Only I have no Sellotape.

139
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,916
Have you got any Sellotape
or Blu-Tack?

140
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,984
Look, everything I've got
is mine.

141
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,825
Touch one thing of mine, and
I'll break your bleeding neck.

142
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,921
All right?

143
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,991
And don't talk to me
unless I tell you that you can.

144
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,798
Now, have you got that?
Ferret features.

145
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,805
- Sorry...
- Shut up!

146
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,398
Shut up.

147
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,137
You settle in all right,
Mr. Mahill?

148
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,304
I told you I wanted to be
on me own, you bastard.

149
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,814
I told you I didn't want to be
bunking up with anyone.

150
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm sorry, Eugene,
but this is a double cell...

151
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,249
I want to be on me own!

152
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,946
All right, Eugene,
just calm down.

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,283
I'll go and get the S.O.

154
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,845
Yeah, yeah, go on, go on.
Piss off!

155
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,551
Don't talk to me like that,
Eugene.

156
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,456
- Get out!
- Calm down!

157
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,290
Oi!
What's going on here?

158
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,456
You pair of pricks don't seem
to understand plain English.

159
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,659
I told you and I told him

160
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,601
that I didn't want to be
bunking up with anyone.

161
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,605
You just watch your mouth,
Eugene.

162
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,232
There's no single cells
available, and that's that.

163
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,401
You wanker!

164
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,807
Step out the cell.

165
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,073
I'm not going anywhere.

166
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,605
Right. I'm warning you, Eugene.
I'm warning you.

167
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,651
âª I want you to show me âª

168
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:43,095
âª I want to feel what love is âª

169
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,691
âª I know you can show me âª

170
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,998
Calm down!

171
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,373
Bastards!

172
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,639
Let me go!
Put me down!

173
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,044
Calm down, Eugene.

174
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,843
- You bastards!
- Calm down.

175
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,077
- Get off!
- Calm down.

176
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,210
Get off!

177
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,949
Jason! Jason!

178
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,424
Leave him, Jason!

179
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,224
I cannot accept that
as an excuse, Mr. Snooper.

180
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,596
But that's the truth.

181
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,999
I honestly
don't remember anything.

182
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,503
I'm due out in four days.

183
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,372
Correction, Mr. Snooper,
you <i>were</i> due for release.

184
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,036
I don't remember what I did.

185
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,979
Been told.

186
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,014
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,052
I can't tell you how sorry I am,

188
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,883
but I don't remember nothing
about it.

189
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,057
This is a very serious charge.

190
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,324
You committed rape.

191
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,732
But Miss Bullock doesn't want to
press charges.

192
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,236
Outside the prison.

193
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,397
That does not mean that we will
ignore the assault.

194
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,565
To the contrary.

195
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
But I don't remember!

196
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,710
I swear on my daughter's life.

197
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,415
Miss Hewitt, I don't remember.

198
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,315
I was stoned.

199
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,411
But you weren't
under the influence

200
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,615
when you left the wing.

201
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,955
Or are you now saying
that you were?

202
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,654
No, I was straight, honest.

203
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,697
So do you now accept
full responsibility

204
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,927
for having these substances
on your person?

205
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,904
Yeah.
I guess I am.

206
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,463
Which is also an offense.

207
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,339
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,916
Would you tell me how you came
to be in possession

209
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,851
of these substances?

210
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,252
I found them.

211
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,066
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring gear in here.

212
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,252
I'm going out.
I am due for release.

213
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,726
No, you're not, Mr. Snooper.

214
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,423
Take him back to the cell.

215
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,261
But she's not pressing charges.

216
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,960
You can't keep me here!

217
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,271
Cheryl, I've got
a message for you.

218
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,276
If you get in that box,
you'll end up in one.

219
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,902
Understand?

220
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,145
I've got friends.
One word.

221
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,151
Come on, Mr. Smith.

222
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,710
We've got people waiting.

223
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,756
Sorry.

224
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,121
I had to talk to my brief,
Mr. Chiswick.

225
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,023
Important.
For my trial an' all.

226
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,028
Nosh is good in here, isn't it?

227
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,233
Great gym.

228
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,901
I'm gonna learn
how to work a computer.

229
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,599
Put me name down.

230
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,738
Got a visit
with me solicitor tomorrow.

231
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,303
Oh, yeah.

232
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,042
Tell him not to bother
getting you out.

233
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,786
I've got a visit tomorrow.

234
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,859
Those pictures of her?

235
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,068
She's pregnant.

236
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,808
Eight months.

237
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,410
Cracks me up seeing her.

238
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,347
Everything's such a mess.

239
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,346
It's a boy.

240
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:36,992
We know it's a boy 'cause, um,
Anna had a scan, and, uh...

241
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,631
I want to see him born.

242
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,771
Can I have your dinner?

243
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,246
Take a look at your client's

244
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,250
criminal record, Mr. Turnbull.

245
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,049
He had already taken an officer
hostage at his previous prison.

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,419
He has served
a number of lengthy sentences

247
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,923
for serious crimes.

248
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,482
Do not try
and make him out to be

249
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,460
some sickly,
hard-done-by creature,

250
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,520
when he is obviously
a very dangerous one.

251
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,623
Where do you bastards get off?

252
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,531
Right now we have
one of the best officers

253
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,126
I've ever come across

254
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,468
unable to come back to work
because of your client.

255
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,802
He nearly killed him!

256
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,851
Yes, Mr. Marshall, I'm very
concerned for Mr. Morgan.

257
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,673
But my client, Mr. Falla,

258
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,272
has made repeated requests
for his case to be reviewed.

259
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,544
It was due to his anxiety
and his frustration

260
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,052
that the hostage situation
arose.

261
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,284
I will agree
to two-week recuperation period.

262
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,294
I want Mr. Falla fit and well to
answer the charges against him.

263
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,886
Thank you.

264
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,159
Well, I'm glad we've been able

265
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,609
to come
to some amicable settlement.

266
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,566
No.

267
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:52,095
Mr. Marshall, could you please
see Mr. Turnbull to the gates?

268
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,103
- Nice to see you again, Davyd.
- Yeah. See you, Tony.

269
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,308
Ah, Dr. Harris, could you
shut the door a moment, please?

270
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,684
Actually he's quite
a nice bloke, you know?

271
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,485
Really?!

272
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,993
Aye, great rugby fullback,
Anthony, yeah.

273
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,256
Yeah, Cambridge Blue.
Played for England.

274
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,127
I want Falla's
previous medical records

275
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,257
gone over
with a fine-tooth comb.

276
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,461
I want that man fitter
and healthier

277
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,333
in two weeks' time
than he has ever been

278
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,270
in his entire nasty,
vicious little life.

279
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,602
Is that quite understood?

280
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,080
<i>- Playboy</i> magazines.
- Yep.

281
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,087
- Pencil sharpener.
- Yep.

282
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,349
- Game Boy.
- Yep.

283
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,687
- Okay, CDs... Bob Marley.
- Bob Marley.

284
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,918
- Bob Marley.
- Bob Marley.

285
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:46,925
Bob Marley.

286
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,518
I told my social worker,

287
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,927
and she said to speak to you,
Mr. Chiswick.

288
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,695
He goes on and on and on
and won't stop.

289
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,632
I'm gonna hit him.

290
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,945
- I'll hit him.
- All right, Roddy.

291
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,995
I said I'll speak to him,
and I will.

292
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,665
Go on.

293
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,709
Back in a second.

294
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,038
Keith Smith!

295
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,238
Me?

296
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,044
What do you want me for?

297
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,676
You leave Roddy alone.

298
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,063
We all know
what he's in here for,

299
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,919
and he doesn't need reminding
of it.

300
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,583
Me, I never said a word to him,
Mr. Chiswick.

301
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,991
Well, you keep it that way,
Mr. Smith.

302
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,328
Black bastard.

303
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,733
You little fruit and nut.

304
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,794
I'll ram up that up
your fat ass, little squealer.

305
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,269
But it could work.

306
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,208
I mean, we're the same height.

307
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,912
And...

308
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,346
Lockup!

309
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,940
Another thing...

310
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,095
When they brought me in,
the photo booth wasn't working.

311
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,485
They don't have a photo of me.

312
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,351
Yeah, but the officers know me.

313
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,915
Some of them do.

314
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,459
Lockup!

315
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,223
No, we'd never get away with it.
It's crazy.

316
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,228
Oh, well.
I offered.

317
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,663
I mean, he was certain
I'd be out.

318
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,394
Out within a week.
That's what he said.

319
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,403
Man, you're covered in tats.

320
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,598
Oh, yeah.
Got 16 of them.

321
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,504
Hey, and two on me thighs.
Do you want to see?

322
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,509
Lockup!

323
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,277
They'll have them listed,
you prat.

324
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,281
Oh, right.

325
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,409
I hadn't thought of that.

326
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,819
Lights out!

327
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,790
Nice and quiet in here,
isn't it?

328
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,723
Lights out!

329
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,893
Sleep well in here tonight.

330
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,929
Good night.

331
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,663
Shut him up!

332
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,472
Shut up!

333
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,803
You shut up as well, Eugene!

334
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,809
You're making just as much noise
as he is!

335
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,742
I'm here on punishment!

336
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,441
If you can't control
that bastard,

337
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm gonna complain!

338
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,509
Do you frigging hear me?!

339
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,487
Tarzan, will you give us a break
and shut your noise?!

340
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,218
Yeah, come on, eh?! You're gonna
be off for seeing your dad!

341
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,056
Oi!
Anyone complaining on me here?!

342
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,358
I'm complaining, you big ape!

343
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,421
Shut your noise, Tarzan!

344
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,796
Oh, you <i>will</i> be!

345
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,028
Do you hear me?!
I'm not scared!

346
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,651
Morning.

347
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,120
Sorry I haven't been able
to get to rehearsals.

348
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,588
How are they going?

349
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,784
Fine, but, uh,
Eugene Buffy's missing.

350
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,521
He's a good part of the chorus.

351
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,996
He can't sing, but he likes to
act as assistant director.

352
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:41,330
He's on punishment. He should be
back on the wing today.

353
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,837
How often have you seen
Russell Morgan?

354
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:45,904
Who?

355
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,669
The officer involved
in the hostage.

356
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,267
Oh, yes.

357
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,088
Well, I've called in on him
a couple of times,

358
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,604
and I've spoken to his wife.

359
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,241
Sorry. I got a bit caught up
in my own problems.

360
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,616
I can arrange to see him.

361
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,154
I think you should.

362
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,554
So...

363
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,089
How are things with you?

364
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,794
Fine, thank you.
Fine.

365
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,630
I keep myself busy, you know?

366
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,305
Mr. Snooper is being held
on the block.

367
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,431
Yes, I know.

368
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,542
I suppose he's available
to be in the musical now.

369
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,478
I take it that was a joke?

370
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,279
Yes.

371
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,750
It was a joke.

372
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,250
Are you sleeping all right?

373
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,814
Oh, really,
this isn't necessary.

374
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,258
- Are you?
- Yes, Helen.

375
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,693
I am aware that I hold

376
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,458
a very responsible position
at Barfield,

377
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,465
and I don't like feeling
that I have to be

378
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,694
constantly reassuring you
of my capabilities.

379
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,861
If you have a problem...

380
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,030
Annette, I do not
have a problem.

381
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,938
I need to make sure
that you don't have one either.

382
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,343
You had a horrific experience.

383
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,643
And it is behind me.

384
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,445
Okay.

385
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,319
I know you've contacted
my last...

386
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,486
The last prison I worked in.

387
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,857
You spoke to Michael Hilliard.

388
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,455
Yes, I did.

389
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,864
Annette...

390
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,265
I'm not prying.

391
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:28,707
It's just that
I am responsible for you,

392
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,267
and I want you to know that
if you need anybody to talk to,

393
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,813
then I am here for you,

394
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,439
just as I would hope that you
would be there for me

395
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,848
should I ever need anybody
to talk to.

396
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,458
What did Michael say about me?

397
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,756
He was very complimentary.

398
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,869
I hear Officer Jackson's
playing a big part.

399
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,462
Yes, he is.

400
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,973
But I haven't cast it all yet.

401
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,041
Do you sing?

402
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,011
Oh! God forbid.
Tone-deaf.

403
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,844
I just felt a deep depression
coming over me, Miss Hewitt.

404
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,080
Wanted to be on my own.

405
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,349
Sorry.

406
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,459
You can't make demands,
Mr. Buffy.

407
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,586
Do you understand that?

408
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,290
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,994
However, when a single cell
becomes available,

410
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,229
I will see to it
that you're on the list.

411
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,634
Thank you very much,
Miss Hewitt.

412
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,002
Very considerate.

413
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,370
Welcome back.

414
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,238
Thank you, Eugene.

415
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,970
Take him back to the wing.

416
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,275
You want to sort out that maniac
down the block, though?

417
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,110
Kept everyone awake
screaming and yelling.

418
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,616
It's like a zoo down there.
All right, guys! A complaint!

419
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,480
Let's go.
Workshops.

420
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,924
Jones.
Let's go.

421
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:54,926
Come on, lads.
Hurry up.

422
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,395
Workshops.
Let's go.

423
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,261
Workshops!

424
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,870
Eugene!

425
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,305
No, it's all right.
I've got a bit of earache.

426
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,276
Ah, you're a regular
hypochondriac, Roddy.

427
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,005
And Eric, Eric!
Hey, hey!

428
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,012
What?

429
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,673
You won't get that lead, mate.

430
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,808
Whoever heard
of a slaphead juvenile lead?

431
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,283
Buffy's having a go at me.

432
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,910
Mr. Jackson,
he's having a go at me!

433
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,421
Yes, will you move?
Come on.

434
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,333
I've got more hair
between the cheeks of my ass.

435
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,802
Thanks for sharing that
with me, Eugene.

436
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,759
Good morning.

437
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,092
- Roddy, come on.
- Come on, lads.

438
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,290
So slow, I'm beginning
to forget me name.

439
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,423
Come on!
Move it!

440
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,297
Ja-son!
Ja-son!

441
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,962
I know it's you, Smith.
Just cut it out.

442
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,101
You skiving off workshop, Kevin?

443
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,506
Um, I've got a migraine,
Mr. Hully.

444
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,568
- I need to get some sleep.
- All right.

445
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,387
Ma'am.

446
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,866
You have a visiting order
for this afternoon

447
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,801
for your father,
Mr. E.S. Braithwaite.

448
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,304
Yes.

449
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,499
And I've asked,
on compassionate grounds,

450
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,974
that I don't see him
in the no-contact section.

451
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:22,347
It'll be the last time, you see?
He's... He's very sick.

452
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,575
I know.

453
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,852
If you promise
that you'll behave yourself,

454
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:27,852
I'll agree to it.

455
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,947
Yes, Miss Hewitt.
Best behavior.

456
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,482
Best behavior.

457
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,357
Thank you, Officer Horrocks.

458
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,593
Johnson, ma'am.

459
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,978
<i>First group of visitors,</i>

460
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,834
<i>checked and coming through.</i>

461
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,780
I'm here because
I have serious allegations

462
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,616
against one of your inmates,
a Mr. Keith Smith.

463
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,282
Uh, Mr. Smith is currently
awaiting trial.

464
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,722
For armed robbery.

465
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,919
He's a particularly unpleasant
and violent man

466
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,724
with two previous sentences
for similar offenses.

467
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,857
One of my witnesses
who knew Mr. Smith at one time

468
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,801
has received numerous
threatening phone calls.

469
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,862
It seems to me
to be quite extraordinary

470
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,033
that a man
who has been refused bail

471
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,439
because of his previous record

472
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,069
of attempting to scare witnesses
at his last trial

473
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,637
is given free access
to a telephone

474
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,047
and able
to use prison-issue phone cards.

475
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,914
I couldn't agree with you more.

476
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,348
And I'm confident that as
you were not cautioned

477
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,758
and went to the station
on your own free will,

478
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,296
the charges against you
might well be dropped.

479
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,561
I'm very hopeful to get bail
within a few days.

480
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:50,569
- Couple of days?
- I'm sorry, Barry.

481
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,832
It's okay.

482
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,238
I like it here.

483
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,003
Tell me again what he said?

484
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,820
They're gonna be casting
the musical this afternoon.

485
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,712
Can't wait.
I've been singing all the solos.

486
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,713
Have you ever seen "Mikado,"
Mum?

487
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,306
I love it!
It's brilliant.

488
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,251
I've been singing "Titwillow,"
"Wand'ring Minstrel."

489
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,254
He started kicking last night,

490
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,847
and I just lay there

491
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,258
and I cried.

492
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,057
I cried all night.

493
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:22,526
I want to be with you.
You know that.

494
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,070
It's all I think about,
day in, day out,

495
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,733
that he's gonna be born
and I'm not gonna be there.

496
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,638
Anna, don't.

497
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,477
Listen to me.

498
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,682
Listen to me.

499
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,752
I might be.

500
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,918
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

501
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,587
I might be able to get out.

502
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,468
What do you mean, like...
Like compassionate leave?

503
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,231
Oh, that would be wonderful,
Kev.

504
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,304
- No.
- When?

505
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:04,606
It's not compassionate leave,
and it might not work.

506
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,270
I can't discuss it now.

507
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:10,510
I'll call you, tell you more.

508
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,582
Okay?

509
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,519
Okay.

510
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,857
Okay.

511
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,261
How you doing,
Mr. Braithwaite?

512
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,853
Been better, son.

513
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,889
Oh, Snoopy,
I just don't understand you.

514
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,095
God.

515
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,798
You were due out.

516
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,338
Did you get into a fight?

517
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,311
God, I mean,
how can they keep you in here

518
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,481
for that amount of time
for no good reason?

519
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,425
Oz, look at me!
I'm your wife, damn it!

520
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,566
I don't know.

521
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,372
I don't want to take about it,
all right?

522
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,067
You hear me?

523
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,702
God.

524
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,649
Keep mum
about the wheelie, lads.

525
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,864
Here he is, Mr. Braithwaite.

526
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,336
Here, have a seat.

527
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,919
Here.

528
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,219
Tea and biscuits.

529
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,021
The chocolate orange ones.

530
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,618
You like them.

531
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,595
Do you want sugar?

532
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,996
Yes.

533
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,159
Three.

534
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,163
Three.

535
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,235
Bit different from my days.

536
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,470
Very nice.

537
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,707
There you are.

538
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,113
Ta.

539
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,767
Biscuit?

540
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,603
You not having one?

541
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,850
No, no.
I don't use sugar.

542
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:58,940
Anyway, they're for you.

543
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:03,079
What you don't eat,
you can take home with you.

544
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,216
- Do you want a biscuit?
- No, thanks.

545
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,396
You all right, Mr. Braithwaite?

546
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,732
Want a doctor?

547
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,678
You want a snout?

548
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,952
No, I don't smoke.

549
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,326
You've got...

550
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,495
You've got smaller.

551
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,328
Yeah.
You've lost a lot of weight.

552
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,595
I'm 72!

553
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,271
Here you go.

554
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,895
Old lag

555
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,374
used to pass out
these boiled sweets.

556
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,446
Every morning I'd see him
passing them out to the screws.

557
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,973
I says, "Hey, what are you doing

558
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,111
sucking up to the screws?"

559
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,452
And he says to me, "I'm not.

560
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,684
I hate the buggers."

561
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,728
So I says, "You're a liar.

562
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:54,130
Every morning I see you
handing them out to the screws."

563
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,972
"Aye," he says,

564
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,840
"but every night I stick them up
me ass, then rewrap them."

565
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,812
I tell you what,

566
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,644
I'm glad I didn't have
one of them biscuits.

567
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:19,214
That was Parkhurst.

568
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,456
Codes jail, Parkhurst.

569
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,896
Nobody ever squealed from there.

570
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,833
It's a codes jail, that's why.

571
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,861
You know all about tough guys,
don't you, Dad?

572
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,067
I know one thing...

573
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,701
If I'd done 20 years' stir,

574
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,043
I wouldn't have got out
and been back 60 days later.

575
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:48,085
Sitting on the steps of Barclays
with a shotgun and a balaclava

576
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,621
is not a tough guy.

577
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,987
Dumb, maybe.

578
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,083
Been banged up so long

579
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,393
you didn't know what time
the effing bank opened.

580
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,330
Another seven years.

581
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,494
That's all you got.

582
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:10,138
I'm writing a book about prison.

583
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:14,942
Huh.
Proud of it all, are you, son?

584
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,614
What you
calling yourself Tarzan for?

585
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,883
Bloody stupid.

586
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,082
It's for wrestling.

587
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,149
It's like that gladiator show
on the telly.

588
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,091
They've all got names.

589
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:36,030
Here.
I done these for you.

590
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,535
They're poems.

591
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,333
Take them home.

592
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,500
I've not got a home.

593
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,306
I'm in a welfare place.

594
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,244
I'm going to die in it.

595
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,309
Don't die in a prison, Vic.

596
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,380
You can't beat the system.

597
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,551
In the end, it beats you.

598
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,264
It's a zoo, all right.

599
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,790
But your name's
Victor Braithwaite,

600
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,599
not Tarzan!

601
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,605
Lord of the apes.

602
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,111
And that your mother's name's
Barbara, aged 43.

603
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,016
Sister called Diana, aged 6.

604
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,817
Address, 44 Elmsworth Crescent.

605
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,414
Your Auntie Carol
lives with you,

606
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,720
your mother's younger sister.

607
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,727
Your dad left in 1985.

608
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,524
Your mother works in a laundry.

609
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,623
You went to school at, um...

610
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:41,826
How do they look?

611
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,425
Oh, they look great, Kev.

612
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,596
Ink's fading just right.

613
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,012
Uh, don't forget the dog.
What's his name?

614
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,508
Archie, right?

615
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,941
Well, where did you
go to school?

616
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,105
Elmwood Comprehensive,
just at the top of our road.

617
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,713
I worked for 18 months.
Where?

618
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,980
Oh...

619
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,577
Sandlers Printworks.

620
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,432
You got fired and went to work
at the candle factory.

621
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,858
You've had measles, mumps,
chicken pox,

622
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,122
and, uh, your wisdom teeth out.

623
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:13,256
Do you think
they'll ask me about that?

624
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,664
I'm only telling you what's
written on me admittance slip.

625
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,834
Now, you're sure
they've got no photo of you

626
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,026
when you came into Barfield?

627
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,133
Yeah, said it wasn't working.

628
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,513
What do we do now, then?

629
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,749
Wait.

630
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,510
Nothing else we can do.

631
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,521
Just have to wait.

632
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,285
Was he very close to his father?

633
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,156
When your old man dies,
it's hard, you know?

634
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,719
You see your own mortality.

635
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,766
He knows he's not gonna
be with him or see him again.

636
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:50,668
I'll go
and have a word with him.

637
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,964
Be careful.

638
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,473
I'm... I'm Chaplain Fuller.

639
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,243
If there's anything you'd like
to talk to me about.

640
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,046
Is anybody there?!

641
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,785
Answer me!

642
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,883
Is there anybody there?!

643
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:18,021
âª But if patriotic sentiment
is wanted âª

644
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,029
Arms up.

645
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,828
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

646
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,629
To the right.

647
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,670
One, two, three, down.

648
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,830
One, two, three, down.

649
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,865
Lunge, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

650
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,468
What's the matter with Eric?

651
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,140
He's been cast as one of
the little maids from school.

652
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,616
He's not a happy man.

653
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,279
Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys.

654
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,947
All line up behind me.

655
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,116
I've got the steps.
I'll show you the steps.

656
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,491
Really small steps
'cause we're playing Chinks.

657
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,494
What's up?

658
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,121
I'm not doing it.
It's not fair.

659
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,632
Just run through it again,
Miss Purvis. Slow tempo.

660
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,965
I can't do it.
I look a right idiot.

661
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,699
You'll be wearing a wig.
And I'm playing a girl as well.

662
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,673
I know that, stupid.
That's not the point.

663
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,233
I just don't want to
play that part.

664
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,243
Suit yourself.

665
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,611
March, two, three, four.
Five, six.

666
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,681
Arms!

667
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,450
Now two steps to the right.

668
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,451
To the left.

669
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,714
One, two...

670
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,653
- Oh!
- Shit, right. Sorry, sorry.

671
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,282
- Annette...
- Sorry! The right. Okay.

672
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,293
Oswald Snooper
has asked to see you.

673
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,089
Now, obviously...

674
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,539
No, I'm sorry,
I don't want to see him.

675
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,532
And I don't think
this is the time or the place

676
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,531
even to discuss it.

677
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,727
Excuse me.

678
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,498
Get to the end here,
drop your fan.

679
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,267
She's supposed to be
the psychologist.

680
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,272
Right, come on.

681
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,467
Once more from the top

682
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,852
before the end of rehearsal,
please.

683
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,435
I do like your cardigan.

684
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,412
Oh, I knitted it myself.

685
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,812
I also do crochet
and needlepoint.

686
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,510
- So do I.
- Oh!

687
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,849
I've just got a lovely pattern
for a bedspread!

688
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,083
Miss Purvis.
From the top, please.

689
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,886
I'm sorry.

690
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,051
She's on drugs.

691
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,570
And one, two, three, four...

692
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,794
Short steps!

693
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,960
Seven, eight.

694
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,697
And two, three, four...

695
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,365
We've got to have
a staff meeting, Miss Hewitt.

696
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,500
HOS is juggling officers around.

697
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,601
These rehearsals
take a lot of organization.

698
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,579
We're really stretched
on my wing without S.O. Morgan.

699
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,048
Well, I've arranged for
P.O. Brent to cover on your wing

700
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,880
until Mr. Morgan's
replacement arrives.

701
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,249
Governor.

702
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,585
And I want Keith Smith's
phone card removed.

703
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:28,058
Waste of time.
He'd get another or steal one.

704
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,837
You do one, you're gonna have to
do them all.

705
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,262
- Keep practicing.
- Yeah, yeah.

706
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,023
Chiswick for C Wing.

707
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,379
You're always making a
fuss, Eric. You're pathetic.

708
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,531
- Is that shepherd's pie?
- Yeah.

709
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,836
- Is that vegetable soup?
- Should be oxtail.

710
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,876
Here, who's that bloke
over there?

711
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,809
He's not been
on our wing before, has he?

712
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,746
Stop nattering.
Come on, Roddy, get a move on.

713
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,282
I'm not creating a fuss.

714
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,046
I just don't want to put a
bloody frock on, and that's it.

715
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,281
Bloody conspiracy.

716
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,617
You look bad enough now,

717
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,681
but everyone'll think
you're a poofter, right?

718
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,056
Shut up.

719
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,028
Is it roly-poly today?
I love that, me.

720
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,222
Custard.

721
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,232
If you don't want your pudding,
I'll have it.

722
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,995
You butlering for Kevin again,
are you?

723
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,278
What's going on between you two?

724
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,396
You ain't a shirtlifter,
are you, Barry?

725
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,031
No, I'm not.
Kevin's got a migraine.

726
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,440
Shove off.

727
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,240
Keith Smith.
Keep your eye on him.

728
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,906
Cell number 22.
Might get in a paddy.

729
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,621
We're taking his phone card
off him, okay?

730
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,116
All right.

731
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,015
Jason.

732
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,554
Ja-son!

733
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,816
Ja-son!

734
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,292
Mr. Bryant, would you tell
prisoner number 741...

735
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,625
Jones, Barry...
To pack up his gear?

736
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,255
He's been released.
2:00.

737
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,596
Right, I'll look for the list
and find out who's who.

738
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,533
- All right.
- Okay.

739
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,966
Ta.

740
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,269
Kev.

741
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,342
What?

742
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,673
Kev!

743
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,237
I've just been told.
I'm out at 2:00.

744
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,613
- When?
- Today.

745
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,652
I told you, didn't I?
I told you.

746
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,278
Today?

747
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,912
But I'm not ready.

748
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,494
I-I won't be able to.
It's too soon.

749
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,827
I'll go in the box!
Put me in the cage!

750
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,230
Put me in the cage!

751
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:21,330
Aaaaah!

752
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,646
Come on!

753
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,774
- Come on!
- Tarzan.

754
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,320
Tarzan.

755
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,223
Right, let's have your trays,
lads.

756
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,369
Come on, Kevin, liven up.

757
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,395
Barry, you get
your kit packed up.

758
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,031
I'll be back for you
before lockup.

759
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,447
See?
I told you, didn't I?

760
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,651
I told you.
He's new on the wing.

761
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:17,355
He doesn't know who anyone is.
And he's taking me to reception.

762
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,563
Right.

763
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,497
Split shields.

764
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,744
Will you talk to me, Tarzan?

765
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,573
Mm.

766
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,779
- Mm.
- Okay.

767
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,859
I understand you must be very
upset about your father, Tarzan.

768
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,055
No, no, no,
you do not understand,

769
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,791
'cause <i>he</i> never did.

770
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,532
My father.

771
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,068
Father's the sweetie man.

772
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,798
Sweetie man.
Do you know what he did?

773
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,035
He wrapped chocolate biscuits up
in my poems.

774
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,939
And he'll never look at them.

775
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,443
He'll never look at them!
He's not interested!

776
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,381
Don't think he ever was.

777
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,080
Eh?
He's dying! He's dying, right?

778
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,214
But what does he come in
and tell me?

779
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,814
What a hard man he is.

780
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,595
All the time he spent in prison.

781
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,130
All six months of it.

782
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,233
But what about me?!

783
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,893
What about me?!

784
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,306
'Cause I tell you, I'm...

785
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,969
I'm tired.
I'm... I'm really tired!

786
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,519
I am really, really tired!

787
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,712
I'm tired!

788
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,984
I'm sick and tired of you!
Asshole!

789
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,654
- Prisoner 741, Jones?
- Yeah.

790
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,426
Got all your kit?

791
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,898
Step out, son.

792
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:05,402
Go with the others.

793
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,065
âª I'm walking,
yes, I'm walking âª

794
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,631
âª And I'll keep on walking âª

795
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:15,442
âª And talking my way
out of here âª

796
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,506
âª So I'm walking,
yes, I'm walking âª

797
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,143
âª And I'll keep on walking âª

798
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,621
âª And talking my way
out of here âª

799
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,769
Look, I've never made

800
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,019
a threatening phone call
in my life.

801
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,924
I swear on my mother's life.

802
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,361
I have never made
a threatening phone call.

803
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,832
I'm gonna take your phone card.

804
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,833
That's illegal.

805
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,166
<i>Mr. Jackson to the TV room.</i>

806
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,830
I'm on remand!
Remand!

807
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,340
We know you've been making
threatening phone calls.

808
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,104
No, I ain't.
That's a lie.

809
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,112
Right!

810
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,443
That's enough!

811
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,418
Put it down.

812
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,991
Put it down now.

813
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,722
Back to your cells.
Come on, move it.

814
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,928
Officer Brent
with prisoner 741, Barry Jones.

815
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,470
Outer gate.

816
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:34,784
Officer Brent.

817
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,756
Officer Gordon.

818
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,171
Good afternoon, Mr. Brent.

819
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,763
Hope you're behaving yourself,
Stanley.

820
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,837
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Brent.

821
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:15,128
I can't give in
to any inmate's demands.

822
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,269
Next thing,

823
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:22,330
we'd have cons asking for
extra sugar on their pudding.

824
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,835
Eh?

825
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:32,509
Extra exercise,
extra time on association.

826
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,279
And we can have that, can we?

827
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:37,720
You're a reasonable man.

828
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,157
You have got to see things
from our side.

829
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,194
Hmm?

830
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,871
Okay.

831
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:59,240
Put your kit on the table, son,
and start stripping off.

832
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,243
All right, Vern.

833
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,405
Um, 741, Jones.

834
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,813
Okay.

835
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,441
Right, Barry.

836
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,112
Go and take a shower.
I'll get your gear.

837
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,298
Know anything
about Russell Morgan?

838
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,462
No.

839
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,301
Few of us got a kitty together,

840
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,950
sent him some fruit
when he was in the hospital.

841
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,307
- Yeah, I know that.
- Checked himself out.

842
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,038
I think he's had
a nervous breakdown.

843
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,082
That's the rumor I heard.

844
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,913
Right.
Huh, no photo.

845
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,953
- Mr. Jones?
- Yep.

846
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:45,148
Just step out a second.
Just want to check your tattoos.

847
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,419
Forearms and thighs.
Let's have a look at you.

848
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:50,052
My, my.
Got enough anchors, have you?

849
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,560
You young people getting
yourselves all inked up.

850
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,601
Macho image.

851
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,600
Now then, Jumbo.

852
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,604
Hello, Vernon.

853
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,038
Here, Jumbo, you seen
the state of that prat there?

854
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,973
Covered in them he is.

855
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,443
I don't know.
Got to be stupid, I think.

856
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:08,639
What?

857
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,306
Well, to get a tattoo.

858
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:14,512
Oh.
Like that one, you mean?

859
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,918
Can you hang on down here?

860
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,432
I'm expecting somebody in
from Walton.

861
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:19,389
Yeah, no problem.

862
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,481
You know, I can't believe

863
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,136
they've still got that lunatic
down the block.

864
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,093
What, Tarzan?

865
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,595
He's a psychiatric case.

866
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,823
I don't know why they bother.

867
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:29,129
If he was a dog,
they'd put him down.

868
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,327
Here.

869
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,937
Come on, son.
We haven't got all day.

870
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,611
Jacket, shirt, and vest.

871
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,346
And what did you have
in your wallet, son?

872
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:52,083
Um, I had a Â£5 note
and a bus pass.

873
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,284
I also had 75 pence in change.

874
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,358
I took a tenner out.

875
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,292
Yeah, all right, son.

876
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,557
Okay, let's get you sorted.

877
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,701
He never even looked
at my poems, you know?

878
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,938
They were my way
of talking to him.

879
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,445
We never, ever could talk.

880
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,526
Now he's dying, and...

881
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,324
And it's the pain.

882
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,909
Would you like to be
on your own now?

883
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,701
Mm.

884
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,003
Yeah.

885
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,270
Okay, what we'll do

886
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,608
is we'll leave it
for a couple of days,

887
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,056
and then
we'll talk like this again.

888
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,484
Just you and me.
Every day, if you want.

889
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:58,012
But you have got to agree
to be quiet,

890
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,582
not upset everybody else.

891
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,218
Okay?

892
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,024
Okay.

893
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,470
Thank you for talking to me.

894
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,833
Thank you.

895
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,435
Thank you very much.

896
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,326
Oh.

897
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,057
No. Come on.

898
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,733
What I'm thinking of doing

899
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,272
is maybe change the names,

900
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,939
so that it fits in
with the prison staff.

901
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,373
And, uh, what's that other one?

902
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,991
- Poo-poo?
- No, poo-bah.

903
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:58,948
Poo-bah.

904
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,780
Poo-bah is the loyal executioner

905
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:01,784
of everything else.

906
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:02,876
Come on, son.

907
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,331
They're waiting for you
at the gate.

908
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,846
Just called in about you.

909
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,755
I walked in
on rehearsals yesterday.

910
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,989
It's like "The Twilight Zone"
in there.

911
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,237
Oi!

912
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,869
You've got to sign out,
you know, son.

913
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,862
Vern, I'm gonna
get back on the wing.

914
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,481
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, Jumbo.

915
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,116
Right, son, want you to sign
there and there.

916
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,320
Gassing again, Curtis?

917
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,726
You'd better
get back on the wing.

918
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,263
You know
who's coming in from Walton?

919
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,330
This bloody idiot.

920
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,333
Oh, what?
I don't believe this.

921
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Ah.

922
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,472
You still here?
Taking your time, aren't you?

923
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,204
Just on his way
to the gate, Gov.

924
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,404
I'll walk him through.

925
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,856
That's all right, Governor.
I'll take him down.

926
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,007
Come on, son.
Up you go.

927
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,448
Who's it whose coming in again?

928
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,042
Brian Samora.

929
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,815
Oh, not that Scouse pest.

930
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,380
Brian bloody Samora.
I've just checked him out.

931
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,550
I know.

932
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,098
Aah! Oh!

933
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,470
Take it easy!

934
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,367
These cuffs are too tight.

935
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,055
Look, I'm gonna make
an official complaint.

936
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,481
Samora? Samora?
Behave yourself, all right?

937
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,916
- I mean it.
- Brian.

938
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,481
I'm sorry, Miss Hewitt.
It was Sharon's fault.

939
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,526
She ditched me,
and I got bevvied.

940
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,255
I can't remember a thing.

941
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,354
Still, we're both back now, eh?

942
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,529
Move along.

943
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,812
âª So, I'm walking,
yes, I'm walking âª

944
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,511
âª And I'll keep on walking âª

945
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:49,781
Yes.

946
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,049
Yes.

947
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,387
Yes!

948
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,427
Yes!

948
00:49:57,305 --> 00:50:57,623
