FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,169
{\an8}EUN-HEE

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,718
{\an8}Did my sister call you by any chance?

5
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:07,233
CHAN-PAL

6
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,026
-Are you awake?
-Yes.

7
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,242
I was too busy to check my phone.
Is Eun-joo out of reach?

8
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,828
No, she was home.

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,796
Ri-ra and Woo-seok came to take
their baby's first birthday photos.

10
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,837
I see.

11
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,183
Go to sleep.

12
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,965
Chan-hyuk.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,925
Yes?

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,850
Iâ¦

15
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,887
hate myself.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,816
What can you do? You can't start over.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,239
Just keep living your life.
I'm cheering for you.

18
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,069
Go to sleep.

19
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,076
Ri-ra insisted
that you have to be a writer.

20
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,501
I quit writing.

21
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,012
Remember the fake love letter you wrote
to me when I was in the military?

22
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,971
No.

23
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,138
I absolutely don't.

24
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,347
Go to sleep.

25
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,104
Okay.

26
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,382
MY DEAREST PARK CHAN-HYUK

27
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,717
My dearest Chan-hyuk.

28
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,636
Before you take a photo,
your lips are smiling

29
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,227
but your nervous chin line stays frozen.

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,862
I want to embrace
your chin softly with my hands.

31
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,243
She lied way too seriously.

32
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,472
I suddenly remembered it too clearly.

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,425
Gosh.

34
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,430
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,808
This is driving me nuts.

36
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,696
You looked so bright
as you took photos everywhere.

37
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,291
And I, at the time tried my best
to capture your image

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,124
in my heart.

39
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,907
I'm leaving first.

40
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,162
Okay, good job.

41
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,080
You should go home too.

42
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,821
Hi.

43
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,326
The alley here is confusing.

44
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,951
Wasn't it hard to find?

45
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,658
I found it easily thanks to you.

46
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,998
-Please sit. I'll get the coffee.
-Okay.

47
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,641
-Here.
-Thank you.

48
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,683
I couldn't come empty-handed,
so I brought some photo books.

49
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,099
Thank you.

50
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,515
Eun-hee never gave me such presents

51
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,516
though she works
at the publishing company.

52
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,438
Thank you.

53
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,485
You're welcome.

54
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,527
Like I said on the phone,

55
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,074
I'm here regarding the contract.

56
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,027
Yes, by the wayâ¦

57
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,697
What contract are you
trying to sign with us?

58
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,577
Ms. Kim Eun-hee postponed
the approval of the photo team.

59
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,375
Is it because

60
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,506
is the photo team our company?

61
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,469
Yes.

62
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,841
We want to write up a contract
with you and your company.

63
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,393
But Ms. Kim Eun-hee never said that to me.

64
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,731
Actuallyâ¦

65
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,692
We have a different photo team
that works with us.

66
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,818
I see.

67
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,530
I understand what you mean.

68
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,244
Ms. Kim Eun-hee doesn't
mix business with private life, butâ¦

69
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,155
I guess she wanted to support her friendâ¦

70
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,164
You should keep working with
the original team.

71
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,535
But you could've just told me
over the phone.

72
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,673
The author wants your photos, CEO Park.

73
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,881
I also heard you shot
a promotional video too.

74
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,335
It's weird that

75
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,723
Ms. Kim Eun-hee still hasn't
brought the contract.

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,257
She was being too strict.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,474
The publishing schedule is tight, soâ¦

78
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,099
Can I give you the contract?

79
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,817
Come in.

80
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,424
Come on in.

81
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,263
-Who else is coming?
-I don't know.

82
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,790
My ballâ¦

83
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,887
Hey, Yong-gyoo.

84
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,740
We're all family.

85
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,659
I thought we should
at least know each other's faces.

86
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,956
Mom.

87
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,176
What is this?

88
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,179
Did you ask me
to call the kids to do this?

89
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,228
It's not what you think.

90
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,240
I have something to tell all of you.

91
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,283
Let's go inside.

92
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,706
Yong-gyoo.

93
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,415
-Can you play alone?
-Yes.

94
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,506
-Stay quiet and draw, okay?
-Okay.

95
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,646
Sit here.

96
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,752
I think I've had

97
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,756
two separate families.

98
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,348
Dadâ¦

99
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,938
Mr. Kim. Don't just do that, andâ¦

100
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,363
You stay quiet.

101
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,821
You should listen to me first too.

102
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,623
After my memories came back,

103
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,160
I thought about it a lot.

104
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,544
I was only going to tell

105
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,883
your Mom and stop there.

106
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,514
But I thought all of you should know
about me, your father.

107
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,603
I committed such a big crime

108
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,314
and have been hiding it

109
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,768
until I reached this age,

110
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,323
making an excuse that it's for my family.

111
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,567
Get up.

112
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,156
We should talk alone later.

113
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,503
How can you do this with our kids?
Don't you feel any shame?

114
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,709
You're soâ¦

115
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,005
You should all get up too.

116
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,219
That's not what it is.

117
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,929
Please listen to me until the end!

118
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,389
If it's what you think it is,
then it would beâ¦

119
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,808
It would be better.

120
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,937
Remember the summer of 1994?

121
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,621
I bought the newest electric fan
after thinking and thinking,

122
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,039
and I was in a hurry to go
to my daughters and caused an accident.

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,580
I had so many thoughts
in that short moment.

124
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,126
"The company didn't sign me
up for insurance."

125
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,750
"I don't have any money."
"How can I compensate?"

126
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,798
Young-sik!

127
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,681
That's the first thing that came
to my mind when I hit a child.

128
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,760
It was only a child and his grandma,

129
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,428
so I took him to a hospital
without reporting it.

130
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,563
His grandma thanked me
for taking him to the hospital

131
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,817
and asked me if it was okay since
the medical bill will be high.

132
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,905
I thought it'd be over if he was
discharged from the hospital, butâ¦

133
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,132
Well.

134
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,376
Mr. Kim did everything he could.

135
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,757
He sent me to school, gave me money,

136
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,014
and played soccer with me.

137
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,426
He looked after my grandma.

138
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,426
I trulyâ¦

139
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,139
received everything.

140
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,983
All right, let's do this.

141
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,859
Young lady, the jujubes are delicious.

142
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,875
I should've gone to jail.
If I didn't even care for you,

143
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,258
that means I'm a beast.

144
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,304
Why would you go to jail?

145
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,388
Do you know that everyone says
that you're a pushover behind your back?

146
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,555
Please take care of Young-sik.

147
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,145
Don't worry.

148
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,855
-Let's work together.
-Okay.

149
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,276
He found me a job at the plant,

150
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,026
and he even saw me get married
and have my kid.

151
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,832
Even families don't do that.

152
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,049
Didn't you

153
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,456
live in Ulsan at that time?

154
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,089
Mom, did you know?

155
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,046
She didn't.

156
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,847
She saw him for a moment
when we went to Ulsan last time.

157
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,102
I lost my memories,
so I couldn't tell her.

158
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,856
I've been living in Ulsan,
and I came to Incheon.

159
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,480
To find my wife.

160
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,319
Mr. Kim told me to get a place
for the three of us,

161
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,946
but I have a place with my kid.

162
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,003
I don't know why he's saying that
when he has such a nice house.

163
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,539
From now on,

164
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,751
it seems like the three of us
have to live together.

165
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,506
I don't know what the law says, butâ¦

166
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,973
I think I must be responsible
for this for my entire life.

167
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,756
Why?

168
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,978
You said it was 1994?

169
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,778
It happened before I was born.

170
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,688
Why are you still responsible?

171
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,371
What's with you? Let's talk later.

172
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,242
Iâ¦

173
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,497
I didn't get to spend much time
with you, Dad.

174
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,825
I've never played ball with you!

175
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,865
Hey.

176
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,259
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,767
Mr. Kim, you didn't have toâ¦

178
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,809
-You need to stop now.
-Young-sik.

179
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,771
Go down and wait in front of the car.
I'll be down soon.

180
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,071
Okay.

181
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,117
Yong-gyoo, let's go home.

182
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,496
Let's go home.

183
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,761
What's your name?

184
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,929
Kim Yong-gyoo.

185
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,433
I'm five years old.

186
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,885
You're so good at playing
by yourself. What a big boy.

187
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,274
Let's go, Yong-gyoo.

188
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,789
Bye.

189
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,893
Can I do this by tomorrow?

190
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,436
I'll meet Ms. Kim Eun-hee tomorrow.

191
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,360
Then I'll leave it here
so you can read the contract form.

192
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
Okay.

193
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,369
That photo is nice.

194
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,037
The location was great.
The weather was good, too.

195
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,258
Eun-hee mentioned you
when she was planning a photo book.

196
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,300
She said you think of Van Gogh's paintings

197
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,513
whenever you take landscape photos.

198
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:22,095
At the time,
I didn't even know what I was saying.

199
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,731
It's embarrassing.

200
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,481
She told you all sorts of
unnecessary things.

201
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,324
When I was at the US headquarters,

202
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,609
I'd been exchanging emails
with Eun-hee for a long time.

203
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,284
At first, it began with work,
but we began to chat more later on.

204
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:43,122
Among everyone I know, I'm sure she writes
the most interesting emails and letters.

205
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,754
She does write well.

206
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,959
Since you're her friend,

207
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,674
you should tell her
to write her own things,

208
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,005
instead of making someone else's book.

209
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,009
Wellâ¦

210
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,514
That's hard to say even between friends.

211
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,136
I heard you two are old friends,
so I thought it would be okay.

212
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,807
I heard she won an award before.

213
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,105
She bragged about that too?

214
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,280
I guess she does want to write.

215
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,953
She said you were the only friend
who went to the award ceremony with her.

216
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,661
Was I?

217
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,366
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,166
The only common factor
between us is Eun-hee,

219
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,168
so I guess I talked too much.

220
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,527
That little child

221
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,159
was made fun of for his injured leg.

222
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,698
He couldn't even kick
a soccer ball with his friends.

223
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,452
He was down so I played ball with him

224
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,711
one or two times,
and you're that upset about it?

225
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,093
You're not one to behave like that.

226
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,641
Dad, can't you get some rest now?

227
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,814
You've worked hard enough.

228
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,560
There's a thing called
statute of limitations.

229
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,653
Are you going to be responsible for life?

230
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,188
You're only going to get older.

231
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,533
You're not young. You're old.

232
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,450
You really aged this time.

233
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,327
Ji-wooâ¦

234
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,878
You're heartbroken for me, that's why.

235
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,925
But,

236
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,305
this is the beginning for me.

237
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,814
Want to go hiking with me?

238
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,725
I'm probably faster than you.

239
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,703
Seriouslyâ¦

240
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,616
I'm leaving first.

241
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,703
You're leaving without
saying goodbye to Dad?

242
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,075
He made his decision.

243
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,581
I heard all about it, so I should go now.

244
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,044
I'll leave without saying bye.

245
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,835
Eun-joo is leaving.

246
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,744
Don't you twoâ¦

247
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,775
have anything to say to me?

248
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,237
You don't want to talk

249
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,947
as it was from a long time ago?

250
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,956
No.

251
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,999
Do you think your father's life
is nothing but pathetic?

252
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,967
Dad, you're back.

253
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,139
You even yell in front of
your dear Ms. Sook.

254
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,181
I'll wrap things up

255
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,393
and go see you later.

256
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,821
My smart eldest daughter,
donât you have anything to say to me?

257
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,864
Is it because you're disappointed in me?

258
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,748
Do as you wish, Dad.

259
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,120
Right?

260
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,536
I should fulfill my duty for life, right?

261
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,919
Your duty was to report it at that time.

262
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,132
Andâ¦

263
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,466
you should've told Mom too.

264
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,555
Since you're married,

265
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,770
you should've asked her
to solve it together.

266
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,561
You did it to provide for us?

267
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,105
No, you just thought that

268
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,229
a kid and a grandma were
easy to deal with.

269
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,646
You wanted to bury it
in the cheapest way possible.

270
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,953
Eun-joo is stern. Why did you ask her
to say something?

271
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Take it easy.

272
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,914
You got attached to him
and told him to call you Dad.

273
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,627
I'm sure you didn't expect it
to pile up as debt for life.

274
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,554
Dadâ¦

275
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,894
Why do you take responsibility
for things you can't handle?

276
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,888
Do you think it's easy

277
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,391
to be responsible for someone?

278
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,404
Tell him to take responsibility.

279
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,072
He said he would do it.
It's none of your business.

280
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,663
You're right about everything.

281
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,197
Yes.

282
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,084
Yes, I'm sorry.

283
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,459
I'm sorry.

284
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,341
Eun-jooâ¦

285
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,451
Yong-gyoo, how many floors are there here?

286
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,493
-Five.
-Yong-gyoo, you're good.

287
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,050
Bye, Yong-gyoo.

288
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,425
Eun-joo.

289
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,809
Why are you following me?

290
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,388
It's your job to comfort them.

291
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,808
They're all grown-ups.
I don't need to comfort them.

292
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,267
-I'll drive you.
-No thanks.

293
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,567
Tae-hyung told me to give you a ride.

294
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,071
You live in that expensive apartment,
and you have anemia and malnutrition?

295
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,238
Live a happy life.

296
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,195
It'd be awkward for you to see the kids.

297
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,454
So I'll live in this house.

298
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,661
But insteadâ¦

299
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,752
take this with you.

300
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,785
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

301
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,302
You said you're looking for a place.

302
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,459
You can't take responsibility
with just words.

303
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,882
Money is scarier than words.

304
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,806
I'll pay it back to Eun-joo
little by little, so you take it.

305
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,694
Please just take it.

306
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,316
Why did you have to bring the kids here
and say such a thing?

307
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,824
You should've consulted me first.

308
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,736
I feel relieved. That's good enough.

309
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,826
I don't know why I didn't have the courage

310
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,791
to say this.

311
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,455
You made me misunderstand all my life
and you feel relieved?

312
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,586
You're going to make
all those years up in one day?

313
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,092
Who told you to make it up?

314
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,351
Just keep on

315
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,967
hating me.

316
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,749
I left something.

317
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,251
Hi.

318
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,883
-Goodbye.
-Okay, goodbye.

319
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,098
Who is it?

320
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,114
Do we have new work?

321
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,399
If you found what you left,
then go home quietly.

322
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,194
Come on, you know it.

323
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,737
I left nothing.

324
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,866
Your phone was ringing
after your blind dates,

325
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,829
so I thought one of them was coming.

326
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,407
Why are you having
such unnecessary thoughts?

327
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,456
You cleaned the office, dressed up,
and brewed coffee.

328
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,416
It calls for the wrong idea.

329
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,207
Butâ¦

330
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,300
He's from the publishing company

331
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,644
where Ms. Eun-hee works?

332
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,759
A contract is precious.
Put it down carefully.

333
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,648
I find myself disgusting as well.

334
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,653
I give up.

335
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,403
I know that I'm never the one for you.

336
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,361
It's not because of my past, is it?

337
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,951
Hey, do you see me as such
a loser after you've given up?

338
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,543
That makes me so sad.

339
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,748
I've been seeing you
since you were a baby.

340
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,369
You're just like a little sister to me.

341
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,747
If you're worried, I listen.

342
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,213
When you're in a bad mood, I am too.

343
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,304
All right.

344
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,304
I'll be your little sister.

345
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,628
Go home.

346
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,466
You idiot. You stupid loser.

347
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,224
This is how real siblings talk.

348
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,388
Jeez.

349
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,919
Butâ¦

350
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,709
I can somewhat understand Dad.

351
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,048
At that time, insurance was
more difficult to process,

352
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,473
and he couldn't ask anyone for help.

353
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,965
He must've felt lost and scared.

354
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,889
Don't you think about Mom?

355
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,641
He changed and didn't come homeâ¦

356
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,769
Never mind.

357
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,109
Let's just try to understand
this separately.

358
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,902
Things will get worse

359
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,105
if we try to convince each other

360
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,276
I have no energy.

361
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,414
I think that's the right thing
to do as well.

362
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,708
Butâ¦

363
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,461
When will you tell Dad?

364
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,507
Shall I go with you?

365
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,130
Do you think itâs easy to tell?

366
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,178
I'm not done wrapping things up, either.

367
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,102
I'll take care of it.

368
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,140
I said that to Mom as well.

369
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,308
Earlier on, that punk Ji-wooâ¦

370
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,895
Wow, he was totally rebellious.

371
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,151
-Weren't you shocked?
-He's a grown-up too.

372
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,277
We all treat him like the youngest
so he just lives his life as the youngest.

373
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,371
Let him be, so he can think
and judge things himself.

374
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,868
At least we have memories of the time
when Mom and Dad got alongâ¦

375
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,834
But Ji-woo doesn't even have that.

376
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,289
He said he never played ball
with Dad. Leave him be.

377
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,050
I'm leaving.

378
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,006
Wait.

379
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,694
Here.

380
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,539
No wayâ¦

381
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,198
Did you forget?

382
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,829
I'm not like you.

383
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,083
Drive safely.

384
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,382
You need to eat well, at least.

385
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,174
Tae-hyung must be out.

386
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,126
I'm not going to see him and leave.

387
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,406
You didn't take the medicine.

388
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,458
I said that you can't ignore
your conditions.

389
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,167
Take care of yourself. You need to focus.

390
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,887
I forgot about the medicine.

391
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,769
I can take care of myself,
so stop being fretful.

392
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
Sometimes I thinkâ¦

393
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,736
if I didn't miscarry at that time,

394
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,576
our child would've been
five years old this year.

395
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,061
I need to stop trying hard
to look like I'm okay.

396
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,478
I can never forgive you.

397
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,815
Whyâ¦

398
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,935
Why are you here?

399
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,947
Your vice CEO came
to our office yesterday.

400
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:15,949
Didn't he tell you?

401
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,986
He didn't.

402
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,292
So he's the type to act cool.

403
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,581
Is it because of the meditation book?

404
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,787
Yes.

405
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,796
Do I have to suffer
because of your office romance?

406
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,469
Why can't you sign
a contract for your friend?

407
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,428
Do you feel uncomfortable?

408
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,930
Let's not do it, then.

409
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,353
Let's go inside.

410
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,454
Ms. Kim Eun-hee.

411
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,117
Please be honest.

412
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,528
Should I stamp the contract or not?

413
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,487
Which are you more comfortable with?

414
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,288
The author likes the photos
and videos taken by the Golden Goose team.

415
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,132
I'd appreciate it if you stamped it.

416
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,376
But sadly, the down payment won't be much,

417
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,383
and you won't make that much of a profit.

418
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,376
I see.

419
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,967
So you couldnât tell me
or ask me this whole time

420
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,643
because it wonât be much money?

421
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,812
Because of money?

422
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,181
Stop it.

423
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,309
Stop it.

424
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,362
Stop picking a fight.

425
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,652
Hi, you're early.

426
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,645
Yes, I did.

427
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,324
Ms. Kim, you're here early, too.

428
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,450
Yes.

429
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,047
-Would you like some coffee?
-Oh--

430
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,339
No.

431
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,665
It'll be over soon.

432
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,636
I'll finish the contract signing
and go to the printing house.

433
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,721
Okay.

434
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,560
So that's all you need to know.

435
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,564
Good morning.

436
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,104
Good morning.

437
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,477
Would you like some coffee?

438
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,943
I'll do it.

439
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,108
Jeez, I never would've imagined.

440
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,824
My goshâ¦

441
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,086
Are you stamping
the Declaration of Independence?

442
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,014
Why do you look so serious?

443
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,675
Because a contract is a holy thing.

444
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,440
EUN-JOO

445
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,397
Yes, Eun-joo.

446
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,066
Chan-hyuk, would you like
to meet up if you have time?

447
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,122
Yes, I'm free whenever.

448
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,990
How about this evening?

449
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,617
Yes, sounds good.

450
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,826
Okay.

451
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,415
Okay.

452
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,759
She wants to see me in the evening.

453
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,800
I know you'll do a good job, butâ¦

454
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,101
She's in the worst condition.

455
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,273
Please look after her.

456
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,610
And for Ji-wooâ¦

457
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,114
Goodness.

458
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,069
You're becoming family.

459
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,447
Jeez.

460
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,785
I'll call you after I meet Eun-joo.

461
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,498
Okay.

462
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,147
That's what you think, Mom.

463
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,646
Mind your own business!

464
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,779
I'm hanging up.

465
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,877
Eat breakfast and take medicine.

466
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,845
Eun-hee gave me this chocolate.

467
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,444
This isâ¦

468
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,029
Eun-hee's sign of withdrawal she gave me.

469
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,904
A sign saying we shouldn't fight anymore.

470
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,405
I'm sure you donât know, but I like this.

471
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,079
Eun-hee is worried about you.

472
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,000
She doesn't want to fight you anymore.

473
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,171
Cutting ties and avoiding each otherâ¦

474
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,170
Once is enough. She doesn't want it again.

475
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,462
So she prepared this,
as she couldn't say it in words.

476
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,587
Soâ¦

477
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,802
She could've said it.

478
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,216
Why give me this all of a sudden?

479
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,271
It's like you giving me medicine
after the meal, all of a sudden.

480
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,440
Like usâ¦

481
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,768
Eun-hee and I changed a bit too.

482
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,278
Eun-hee always complained
that Dad only cared about me,

483
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,321
but Dad didn't discriminate against us.

484
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,283
He found kind Eun-hee comfortable, butâ¦

485
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,737
I'm sure he found me uncomfortable.

486
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,709
Because I'm not his real daughter.

487
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,748
What does that mean?

488
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,298
How can you not understand
such a simple sentence?

489
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,894
We need to stop too.

490
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,063
Let's get divorced.

491
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,681
Why didnât you tell me your emails

492
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,767
with the vice CEO?

493
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,479
I thought there was no use
in telling you that.

494
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,453
That lazy look on your face.

495
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,778
This hardly ever comes out
during a relationship.

496
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,777
Mr. Carless.

497
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,039
Want a ride to the station?

498
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,209
No, thanks. Stop slacking off
and go to the printing house.

499
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,129
I have a place
I want to check out since I'm here.

500
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,884
Where? This is my territory.

501
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,686
Just walk naturally.

502
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,489
The model looks tacky,
so I can't take photos anymore.

503
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,906
Isn't the view great here?

504
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,413
This is the park I love.

505
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,719
You should go to the printing house.

506
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,595
The vice CEO coming to my office

507
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,062
without telling you,

508
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,021
doesn't that mean he's concerned about us?

509
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,363
You call him the vice CEO
for signing a contract?

510
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,068
You have the mind of a businessperson.

511
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,193
I don't think he's Mr. Playboy,

512
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,658
and he seemed to know
your personality well.

513
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,121
It seems like he thinks about you a lot.

514
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,869
Wow, but he couldn't keep a poker face.

515
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,958
How come you two didn't get caught?

516
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,878
Look at you all ladylike
because I'm complimenting your lover.

517
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,045
Are you happy?

518
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,717
I'm notâ¦

519
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,141
That wasn't a pleasant sight.

520
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,812
I had something to tell you,
but now I don't. Bye.

521
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,981
No.

522
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,150
If you don't tell me,

523
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,478
I'll die from curiosity.

524
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,823
What is it? Tell me before you go.

525
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,447
-Eun-hee.
-Yes?

526
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,329
Iâ¦

527
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,331
I treasure Ji-woo
like he's my own brother,

528
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,208
and I like Eun-joo

529
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,502
and am polite to her

530
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,422
because ofâ¦

531
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,137
you.

532
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:08,232
Eun-joo and Ji-woo are my friend's sister
and my friend's brother,

533
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,983
and in front of them

534
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,442
you, my friend, are always there.

535
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,784
To meâ¦

536
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,750
my friend is the most important.

537
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,877
Is there a more perfect
confession of friendship than this?

538
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,250
It makes my heart flutter
and makes me sad.

539
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,419
You big liar.

540
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,814
Wow.

541
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,521
You're so keen.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

542
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,350
Hey, you're always on Eun-joo's side,

543
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,395
you know Ji-woo's secrets more than I do,

544
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,689
treat me like number three,

545
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,153
and what? Friend?

546
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,737
Hey, why would I believe that?

547
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,239
You dumbâ¦

548
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,083
What? What did you just say?
Did you just curse at me?

549
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,158
-I didn't curse.
-I heard it.

550
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,454
I didn't curse.
Shall I buy you a hearing aid?

551
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,748
Wow, Kim Eun-hee just cursed at me.

552
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,002
No.

553
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,843
-Forget it.
-I'm going to be obsessive.

554
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,798
Wow, Kim Eun-hee, you cursed.

555
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,878
Hey, I didn't curse.

556
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,173
-You're soâ¦
-How can I curse at my friendâ¦

557
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,346
Hey.

558
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,873
From getting to work until now,

559
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,372
he's super serious.

560
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,670
Vice CEO.

561
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,126
Do you help
with other team's work like this too?

562
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:06,137
Like you would go to someone else's office
to give them a contract?

563
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,268
No.

564
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,519
Then from now onâ¦

565
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,442
I refuse any help that is uncomfortable.

566
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,936
Okay, I understand.

567
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,451
I ordered it when I ordered mine.

568
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,820
Well, I don't think this is an occasion
to choose what to drink.

569
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,038
Okay, thank you.

570
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,499
I'm going back to the US.

571
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,083
I'm sure you heard it from Geon-joo.

572
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,955
I wanted to see you before I leave.

573
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,681
Geon-joo and I went on a vacation

574
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,473
for more than a week, right?

575
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,351
I was surprised
that you never called or texted him.

576
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,480
I had his phone the entire time.

577
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,571
Why didn't you call him?

578
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,489
I thought he had a reason
for not being able to call me.

579
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,701
Geon-joo did everything
to stop me three years ago.

580
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,828
I should've ended it then.

581
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,495
I got soft and couldn't end it.
I regret it. I was angry.

582
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,922
So I wanted to harass him
as much as he harassed me.

583
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,054
That took a week.

584
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,429
I read the emails
you two exchanged with each other.

585
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,598
I didn't know I was exchanging
emails with Geon-joo.

586
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,638
Anyway,

587
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,388
Geon-joo stopped me,
but he cheated on me, again.

588
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,846
He had small affairs from time to time.

589
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,846
Oh.

590
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,484
Small affairs.

591
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,530
That's fresh vocabulary.

592
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,946
Do you know that you're a bit funny?

593
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,080
When we meet in the US, let's get along.

594
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,127
He came here to close
and wrap up the Korean branch,

595
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,842
so he's going back to the U.S.

596
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,552
You didn't know about the email,

597
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,426
and that he came here
to close your workplace.

598
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,223
You just had your office romance.

599
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,477
The email was a mistake.

600
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,228
The latter is probably confidential.

601
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,057
It wasn't even that romantic.

602
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,031
We slept together on the last day.

603
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,987
I think it was the warmest
and cuddliest moment

604
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,326
in our relationship.

605
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,656
I felt that all those years
weren't a total waste of time,

606
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,747
and it comforted me.

607
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,802
He couldn't even ask me
to give it back to him.

608
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,183
Give this to Geon-joo.

609
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,141
I don't want to tell him
about our encounter.

610
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,767
You give it to him before you go.

611
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,943
Tell him.

612
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,149
Iâ¦

613
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,778
don't want to see him again.

614
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,196
I alsoâ¦

615
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,283
don't want to get involved.

616
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,876
I have to eat lunch,
so I can't give you all day.

617
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,056
What is it?

618
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,346
We decided to get divorced.

619
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,690
We will solve it logically without causing

620
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,321
any ruckus.

621
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,743
I'll trust you for now.

622
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,656
Butâ¦

623
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,084
Divorce is more realistic than marriage.

624
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,754
You never know
what will happen in the future.

625
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,336
Do you think Tae-hyung is refusing

626
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,884
when he can choose differently

627
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,468
like when he went to
medical school for you

628
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,272
and was forced into marrying me?

629
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,812
That's not a choice.

630
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:10,187
No one can be against Tae-hyung
or persuade him.

631
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,185
Looks like we won't
see each other anymore.

632
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,861
People give tons of advice or curses

633
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,620
when they're not going to
see the other again.

634
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,577
Do they put their bad feelings
in advice or curses?

635
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,585
You go ahead first.

636
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,384
I don't feel good,
so I need to skip lunch today.

637
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,548
Okay.

638
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,925
Do you have anything else to say?

639
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,555
You should eat lunch.

640
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,523
I'm leaving.

641
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,667
Sang-sik, did you get younger?
You're working so hard.

642
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,007
Yes, I got younger.

643
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,304
I am full of energy.

644
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,887
But your face is dirty
and covered in fatigue.

645
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,524
Let's keep an eye out, okay?

646
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,980
I've been told that
I'm money-crazy all my life,

647
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,441
so why keep an eye out?

648
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,442
You remember that?

649
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,323
You go and tell them.

650
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,440
Tell what?

651
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,696
Whenever people criticize you,
I close my mouth and ears.

652
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,819
Tell them I was money-crazy

653
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,826
because I had to provide
for two families all my life.

654
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,826
Your husband is romantic.

655
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,495
He gets jealous,
and he misunderstands too.

656
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,380
Try experiencing it. It's ridiculous.

657
00:52:56,464 --> 00:53:00,474
And you shouldn't say that
since you have the best husband.

658
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,142
I don't really like my husband.

659
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,141
Yes.

660
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,975
No one's 100% perfect.

661
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,690
Though he's so nice to me

662
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,153
it doesn't go away.

663
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,822
When he was a professor,

664
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,741
he never let our kids live freely.

665
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,240
He made them study all night, hit them,

666
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,784
and wouldn't even
let them waste one minute.

667
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,198
Even if we have a grandchild.

668
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,247
Those memories are still so vivid.

669
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,625
You told me your husband
knew nothing but the kids.

670
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,422
I was so envious when I heard that.

671
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,593
He really did.

672
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,310
Don't eat more than three.

673
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,140
Fruits have poison too.

674
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,707
Hi, Eun-joo.

675
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,971
I saw the wedding photos again.

676
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,943
Now, tell me what you saw
and heard that day.

677
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,191
Actually, it was nothing.

678
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:43,406
Your friends who brought the bouquet

679
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,568
were waiting for me after the wedding,

680
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,914
begging me to send the photos.

681
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,504
Because they were sure
you wouldn't send them.

682
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,044
They gave me an address in London.

683
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,093
So did you send them?

684
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,960
Yes.

685
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,627
I still keep in touch
with them through social media.

686
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,305
You're as nosy as Eun-hee is.

687
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,781
I was their friend for almost 20 years.

688
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,285
They said I'm closer than family, butâ¦

689
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,119
I never told them about my family.

690
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,794
Did I keep too much distance from them?

691
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,633
I think it's kind of my fault.

692
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:55,104
I feel like you caught
my inferiority and scars

693
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,265
that even my family doesn't know about.

694
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,863
Didn't you tell me to look at my wedding
photos for me to find out about that?

695
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,947
Actually, they contacted me again.

696
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,413
Those two are always curious about you,

697
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,124
so I thought you should contact them.

698
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,827
So I got a bit nosy.

699
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,633
Does my situation look like

700
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,380
I need some friends I haven't
kept in touch with for years?

701
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,810
Yes.

702
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,272
Sometimes friends can do

703
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,899
what your family can't do.

704
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,113
It's delicious.

705
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,493
Eun-hee liked you before.

706
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,116
She keeps her distance
when she likes someone.

707
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,751
She's the middle child.
So she learned that she must be keen,

708
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,499
please people and make them laugh

709
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,468
to keep the family going way too early.

710
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,468
She's used to lowering herself,

711
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,640
so when she sees someone decent,

712
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,639
she thinks he is out of her league
and draws a boundary.

713
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,309
Oh.

714
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,944
That's the part of Eun-hee's personality
only a family would know.

715
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,074
She just looks super optimistic
on the outside.

716
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:14,568
Anyway, she talked a lot about you
after she got into school,

717
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,741
and then suddenly stopped.

718
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,455
She has to mature and overcome it.

719
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,207
I wonder how her current relationship is.

720
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,843
I was not supposed to be displeased
with Eun-hee anymore.

721
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,848
It's okay, you can do that
with me as much as you want.

722
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,074
Wow.

723
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,619
The taste is different.

724
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,835
Goodbye.

725
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,212
This tastes different too.

726
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,217
Chan-pal. Park Chan-pal.

727
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,306
Your voice sounds seriously ominous.

728
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,522
-What are you doing?
-Want to know?

729
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,653
Then give me 50 cents.

730
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,771
I'm going home after meeting Eun-joo.

731
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,398
Bye.

732
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,086
I worked late all week.

733
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,679
When I think about it now,

734
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,050
I've been waiting for you.

735
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,752
I was going to leave it here and go,
but I was flustered to see you here.

736
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,878
I don't know how I got to play this role.

737
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,508
Ha-ra said she feels uncomfortable
seeing you again.

738
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,007
Thank you.

739
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,555
Do you have any other questions to ask?

740
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,350
No, I donât.

741
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,278
How dare youâ¦

742
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,031
Why are you here?

743
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,038
Are you tracking me? Are there no secrets?

744
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,500
I tracked you down through your brother.

745
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,670
That bratâ¦

746
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,828
He's been asking me where I am.

747
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,337
Well done.

748
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,209
Chan-pal. Welcome, Chan-pal.

749
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,455
Good to see you.

750
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,547
Chan-pal.

751
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:04,103
She's the middle child.
So she learned that she must be keen,

752
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,812
please people and make them laugh

753
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,309
to keep the family going.

754
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,311
She's used to lowering herself,

755
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,563
so when she sees someone decent,

756
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,645
she thinks he is out of her league
and draws a boundary.

757
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:20,072
Chan-pal.

758
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,453
Stop it now, or I'll leave.

759
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,485
Hey, get your own one.

760
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,458
This is a ritual to end my love triangle.

761
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,165
How childish.

762
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,762
So, are you done with that
incoherent love triangle?

763
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,757
Eun-joo doesn't know, does she?

764
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,261
That you sent me her photo

765
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,016
instead of yours in the army.

766
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,393
Hey.

767
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,150
Mr. Kim, we're off now.

768
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,191
No one's here, so you two
have a lovey-dovey moment.

769
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,236
Look in the kitchen
and eat anything you want.

770
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,031
Wait for me.

771
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,238
They laugh at everything.

772
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,070
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

773
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,282
Donât frown.

774
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,525
And donât yell.

775
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,407
Iâ¦

776
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,537
I didnât do anything.

777
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,833
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

778
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,963
I told you not to frown.

779
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,585
If you don't take this,

780
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,596
I'm going to think
you have different thoughts.

781
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:14,846
What thoughts?

782
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,194
I'll assume that you want me
to sell the house

783
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,310
and give half that money to you.

784
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,612
All right.

785
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,361
I'll take this bankbook,
so don't worry about that.

786
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,616
-I'll send you living expensesâ¦
-Living expenses?

787
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:34,043
Stop being arrogant
and think that you provided for me.

788
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,460
I'm the one who provided for you.
I don't need living expenses.

789
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,166
You think I tried
to graduate from marriage

790
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,552
without a plan?

791
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,472
Don't make an excuse to contact me.

792
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,718
Did you tell Eun-joo?

793
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,005
Hey, that was a long time ago.

794
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,307
You big coward.

795
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,181
I didnât tell her.

796
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,438
If you're so scared,

797
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,559
Why send me her photo instead of yours?

798
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,730
Since everyone at your base

799
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,065
was looking forward to
your girlfriend's photo,

800
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,651
I was burdened

801
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,025
and Eun-joo is pretty.

802
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,280
That photo of her was
exceptionally pretty.

803
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,744
You also

804
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,957
have lots of decent photos
of you taken by me.

805
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,829
I'm a good photographer.

806
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,971
The first photo of yours I took

807
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,839
was at the literature award
ceremony. Remember?

808
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,468
I remember.

809
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,183
We wereâ¦

810
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,187
20 years old at the time.

811
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,812
Goodness.

812
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,210
Perfect timing for the requested song.

813
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,924
After the award ceremony,

814
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,713
we got drunk and walked down
the stone wall of Deoksugung Palace.

815
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,126
Right. It was autumn.

816
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:14,006
Yellow ginkgo leaves looked like
incandescent lamps.

817
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,307
How long did we walk there

818
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,021
talking about silly things?

819
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,351
I'm sure we walked
about 100,000 steps that day.

820
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,517
Youth is amazing.

821
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,185
If I rank
the most perfect days in my life,

822
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,031
that day would be number one or two.

823
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,952
Wow, what an honor.

824
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:39,834
I never thought of you as a man,
and you never thought of me as a woman.

825
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,462
We were purely friends.

826
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,619
We giggled,

827
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,673
we got serious,

828
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,714
and we talked about
our dreams and future too.

829
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,589
Actually, on that dayâ¦

830
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,853
I picked up a ginkgo leaf
and took it home.

831
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,314
So I can remember it.

832
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,058
So, did you remember it for a long time?

833
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,280
Wellâ¦

834
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,284
I'm confessing this to you
for the first time.

835
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,583
I was about to go to school the next day,

836
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,287
and suddenly, I thought of you as a man.

837
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,052
"He'll be there when I go to school."

838
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,219
"No one knows we walked down
the stone wall of Deoksugung Palace

839
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,181
until midnight all by ourselves."

840
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,257
"We have a secret to ourselves."

841
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,596
"What should I do when I see you?"

842
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,307
I was making myself up,
thinking about that.

843
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,857
With my heart fluttering,
I went into the classroom, butâ¦

844
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,489
A secret to ourselves?

845
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,738
You were advertising the photos

846
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,906
from the ceremony and the stone wall
to Jong-pal and other kids.

847
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:06,616
Wow, I was so embarrassed,
my face turned red,

848
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,037
and I felt like I got caughtâ¦

849
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,090
On that day, youâ¦

850
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,337
You were disqualified as a man in my life.

851
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,903
Hey, what is this feeling?

852
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,320
I feel like I've been dumped
even without dating you.

853
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,657
You are

854
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,249
the stone wall of Deoksugung Palace to me.

855
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,540
It's like the memory of autumn
when I was 20.

856
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,667
Yes.

857
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,721
Shall I call you Deoksugung Boy now? Let's

858
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:08,935
go.

859
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:14,654
How could you keep
such a big accident a secret from me?

860
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,109
We're graduating from marriage,

861
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,735
so I thoughtâ¦

862
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,872
it doesn't matter.

863
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,872
But how could you not tell me
about it all your life?

864
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,913
I might die from anger!

865
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,174
Do youâ¦

866
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,590
not have any secrets?

867
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,097
I have no secrets!

868
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,678
On Eun-joo's wedding dayâ¦

869
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,191
Eun-joo's father came.

870
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:57,111
Didnât you keep in touch
with him all your life?

871
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,055
I met your mother today.

872
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,475
What for?

873
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,270
I needed to wrap things up.

874
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,607
Your mother missed the chance

875
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,820
to apologize to me today.

876
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,703
She won't. Don't waste your energy.

877
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,781
Divorce is between the two of us.

878
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,116
No, it won't be between the two of us.

879
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,915
Wait and see what I'll do from now on.

880
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,795
You said it's a memory,

881
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,183
but why am I about to begin now?

882
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:38,307
Dad, you know nothing about Ms. Sook.

883
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:41,815
I'm a family, but I hardly have
any memories of you.

884
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,529
-Eun-joo.
-You said you'd tell me.

885
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,029
I don't think I can forgive myself!

886
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,701
It'd be wrong if Dad
is the only one who doesn't know.

887
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,161
Why do you think CEO is a playboy?

888
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,871
So he told that young lady everything.

889
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,661
Why won't you even look at me?

890
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,785
I'm sorry.

891
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,171
Did you live your life
feeling like you're indebted?

892
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:01,088
I felt it was so unfair
to the point I wanted to die.

893
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:09,338
