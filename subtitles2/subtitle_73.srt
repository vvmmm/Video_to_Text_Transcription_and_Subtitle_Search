FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,827
{\an8}What?

4
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,674
If you replied to my text,
I wouldn't be here.

5
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,671
{\an8}There was a get-together.

6
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,093
{\an8}How lowly do you think of me?

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,549
{\an8}What are you talking about?

8
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,795
{\an8}Never mind.

9
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,522
{\an8}I'll finish it soon and leave as promised.

10
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,179
{\an8}I had to say this face to face.

11
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,652
As of today,

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,645
I'm done with you.

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,321
You're out.

14
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,445
As of today,

15
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,737
I'm done with you too.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,700
You're out.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,630
You didn't have to come
all the way here for that.

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,924
You could've called me.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,550
All right.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,853
Hi.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,600
Hi.

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,728
I'm not going for a second round,
so I'm on my way home.

23
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,355
I'll get going.

24
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,488
It's a meditation book team dinner,
so it'd be nice to introduce him.

25
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,647
Okay, goodbye.

26
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,368
Let's have a drink next time.

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,754
Go to the second round.

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,545
I said everything so I'm leaving.

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,690
Eun-hee, do you even know what you want?

30
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,234
Do you have a goal?

31
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,112
Don't you have any desires for yourself?

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,817
How lowly do you think of me?

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,430
Eun-joo.

34
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,007
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,193
Why are you sorry all of a sudden?

36
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,440
I couldn't keep my promiseâ¦

37
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,532
to you.

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,649
What promise?

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,196
On the day I took the photo
in the living room,

40
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,659
I made a promise to you
in your mother's womb.

41
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,542
"I will raise you to be the best."

42
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,789
"I will let you do anything you want."

43
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,871
"I will be the best father in the world."

44
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,628
I couldn't keep any of those.

45
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,804
None of it.

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,349
In my opinion, you raised her wonderfully.

47
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,306
Did I?

48
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,445
How lovely do you think Eun-joo is?

49
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,542
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

50
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,043
He's not the kind of person
to answer questions like that.

51
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,046
Yes, I know how my son-in-law is.

52
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,974
But I asked so I can brag.

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,299
Eun-jooâ¦

54
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,523
has been lovely
from the moment she was born.

55
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,932
It's not because she's my daughter.

56
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,517
The nurses all said so.

57
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,482
The said newborn babies don't have
defined facial features,

58
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,943
so they all look similar,
but she was different.

59
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,364
She had large eyes.

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,533
She smiled so well too.

61
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,914
When she was in universityâ¦

62
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,075
she shined so brightly.

63
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,048
When sheâ¦

64
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,755
was at her loveliestâ¦

65
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,243
I'm home.

66
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,250
Hi, Eun-joo.

67
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,289
When she was young and beautiful

68
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,337
she was busy making money
because of her pathetic father.

69
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,553
I was uneducated,

70
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,675
and I couldn't do anything else
when I was injured,

71
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,524
so I felt so sorry.

72
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,929
I have toâ¦

73
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,521
pay it back.

74
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,581
Take it as the love from
your pathetic father.

75
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,293
I couldn't tell you at the time,

76
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,207
but when I got this bankbookâ¦

77
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,384
I was flustered.

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,888
Did you live your life
feeling like you're indebted?

79
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,099
To pay back the money
that cannot even be calculated?

80
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,311
This money would have
helped Mom to live better

81
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,766
and struggle less every month.

82
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,074
Don't you ever think about Mom?

83
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,316
If it was Eun-heeâ¦

84
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,615
do you think you'd try this hard?

85
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,497
"If it was Eun-hee?"

86
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,878
She's trying to tell you
she can't take it.

87
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,474
I'll take it.

88
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,799
I'll take it.

89
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,341
I'll take it.

90
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,352
Because you feel uncomfortable.

91
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,227
I'll take it.

92
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,219
Don't go.

93
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,493
I want to know why you're doing this.

94
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,949
I need to know why I'm out.

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,580
At that time, at least
I had a clear reason.

96
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,710
A clear reason?

97
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,544
Do you still think I was happily
eating, drinking, and hanging out

98
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,248
with Jong-pal and that woman?

99
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,588
You weren't even cleared up

100
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,842
but just apologized
because you ran into me?

101
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,835
I cleared that.

102
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,716
I thought it was cleared.

103
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,103
I thought that woman took it her own way
and got the wrong idea.

104
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,602
Let's not talk about that time.

105
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,143
I'm talking about right now.

106
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,479
Explain why I'm out.

107
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,454
"Familiarity breeds contempt."

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,490
I hate this quote.

109
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,122
Even to someone closeâ¦

110
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,119
It implies I have to be even more polite
to someone close.

111
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,872
Then are there no honest relationships
in this world?

112
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,535
Isn't that too sad?

113
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:03,964
Butâ¦

114
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,590
"Familiarity breeds contempt."

115
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,381
This crappy quote was true.

116
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,720
You've been too rude to me.

117
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,891
That's why you're out.

118
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,352
What about you?

119
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,225
Have you always been polite to me?

120
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,520
A lot.

121
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,819
I think I have been polite enough to you.

122
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,856
You told Seo-young.

123
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,203
She knows about dating class
and Mr. Playboy too.

124
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,450
Just how much did you tell her?

125
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,372
Is it okay to do that behind my back?

126
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,870
Just what do you see me as?

127
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,504
You never change.
It's the same as last time.

128
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,876
"You are so low, but I'll embrace you
with my big, warm heart."

129
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,963
Is that it?

130
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,167
That's a lot of love for humanity.

131
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,147
It was just

132
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,359
between you and me.

133
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,358
She was saying
the exact same words I used.

134
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,623
Then how was Iâ¦

135
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,041
supposed to interpret that?

136
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,785
You already made up your mind,
so why am I so angry at you?

137
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,957
I'm the weird one for getting angry.

138
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,467
To you,

139
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,968
I'm the idiot who showed
photos from the stone wall to others,

140
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,221
not knowing that was a secret.

141
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,262
That's what I am to you.

142
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,894
Let's stop here.

143
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,436
She's better now.

144
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,653
She'll come out when she calms down.

145
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,859
Tae-hyung.

146
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,908
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,620
Our first house after we got married

148
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,661
was smaller than half of this living room.

149
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,250
A small kitchen and a room
were all we had.

150
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,802
My wife

151
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,132
is shy, so she told me
to go to the kitchen

152
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,545
whenever she was changing clothes.

153
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,018
I don't know why I'm saying this.

154
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,811
Is it because this house is too big?

155
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,614
Are you two

156
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,069
living happily together?

157
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,254
Yes.

158
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,530
Eun-joo, where are you?

159
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,775
Eun-hee.

160
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,698
Eun-joo is resting.

161
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,617
Oh.

162
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,960
Is she sick again?

163
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,999
No, that's not what it isâ¦

164
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,335
Is something wrong?

165
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,803
I'm going to have a change
in family relations.

166
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,303
As we know now, it'll change.

167
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,104
Tae-hyung.

168
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,215
Is Eun-jooâ¦

169
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,562
avoiding my calls?

170
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,606
No, that's not what it is.
Want to talk to her?

171
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,650
No.

172
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,859
It's okay.

173
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,746
The only person I want to see

174
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,291
at this moment.

175
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,416
My sister.

176
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,677
Why are you here?

177
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,694
Yes.

178
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,485
I'm here to give you the bankbook.

179
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,488
I brought it back.

180
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,830
I made a mistake.

181
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,042
I didn't know how thoughtful Eun-joo was,

182
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,544
and I was selfish. So I made her cry.

183
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,007
Eun-jooâ¦

184
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,011
She cried?

185
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,766
She resented me saying that if I gave that
money to you every month,

186
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,309
you would've been more comfortable
about living expenses.

187
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,071
I thought you would've
felt the same as I did.

188
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,452
I wanted to pay back the money

189
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,743
my daughter tried so hard for.

190
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,452
You go in and explain it to her.

191
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,037
Iâ¦

192
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,499
I can't go in.

193
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,255
Didn't Eun-jooâ¦

194
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,807
tell you?

195
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,981
Tell me what?

196
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,773
Eun-jooâ¦

197
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,403
She knows.

198
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,648
She knows that you're not

199
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,236
her biological father.

200
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,155
Eun-hee

201
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,701
and Ji-wooâ¦

202
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,075
know about it too.

203
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,012
Did you tell them?

204
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,716
Why?

205
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,642
So you can graduate kids from me too?

206
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,020
Is it always my fault
when something happens?

207
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,274
You agreed with me to keep it
a secret forever,

208
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,399
but you couldn't even keep it.

209
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,260
Dad, whyâ¦

210
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,258
Why do you take responsibility
for things you can't handle?

211
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,103
Do you think it's easy
to be responsible for someone else?

212
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,508
If it was Eun-heeâ¦

213
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,267
do you think you'd try
so hard to pay it back?

214
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,732
I'll take it.

215
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
Because you feel uncomfortable!

216
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,608
I'll take it.

217
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,831
I'm a loser.

218
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,091
I'm a loser.

219
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,879
I'm a loser!

220
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,755
Stop it!

221
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,215
Stop it.

222
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,281
Why are you still here?

223
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,826
Do you have more to search for?

224
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,331
How did it go?

225
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,495
What?

226
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,924
Didn't you go to see Eun-hee?

227
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,835
If a misunderstanding occurred
between friends, you should've cleared it.

228
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,135
Did she act fine and then
get upset behind your back?

229
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,354
I'm sure she didn't want
to make the same mistake again.

230
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,425
That frustrates me so much.

231
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,187
Why did you secretly look at my phone?

232
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,074
I need an answer.

233
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,657
When that incident happened,

234
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,155
I saw my mom's phone by coincidence,

235
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,708
and she was comforting that punk's mom.

236
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,920
She said it's because I'm sensitive.

237
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,300
I totally fell apart at the time.

238
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,051
You exchange messagesâ¦

239
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,601
with my mom as well.

240
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,345
Soâ¦

241
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,811
I wanted to check it.

242
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,896
What did you want

243
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,909
your parents to do for you at the time?

244
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,446
I didn't want much.

245
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,084
I just wanted them to admit
that it happened to me.

246
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,205
What do you mean? They all know.

247
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,963
No.

248
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,087
They turned a blind eye to it.

249
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,255
They're nice to me like nothing happened.

250
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,176
They laugh,

251
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
buy me expensive giftsâ¦

252
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,978
and act like everything
is the same as before.

253
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,322
I hate that so much.

254
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,252
They might've thought
acting like nothing happened

255
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,959
would be safer than making things worse.

256
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,379
A method of protecting the familyâ¦

257
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,799
can be cowardly sometimes.

258
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,531
Why don't you go into the room?

259
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,661
He took the bankbook back.

260
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,089
You stopped me earlier, right?

261
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,666
We all know. He should know too.

262
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,088
I stopped you because it seemed
overwhelming for you to say.

263
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,095
I haven't talked to my father for decades.

264
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,022
A biological father
isn't important at this age.

265
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,905
Why are you bringing up my age for this?

266
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,451
Divorce isn't important at this age.

267
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,329
A birth secret isn't important
at this age.

268
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,665
Does that mean nothing
should be important at this age?

269
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,171
What's wrong with my age?

270
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,722
Right.

271
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,551
Eun-hee called.

272
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,260
She didnât sound well.

273
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,426
And she asked
if you were avoiding her calls.

274
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,227
She and I don't mix at all.

275
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,108
Why ask such
an unnecessary question to you?

276
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,370
EUN-HEE

277
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,172
Where's Tae-hyung?

278
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,288
Did he go inside?

279
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,997
Should I say hi to him?

280
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,046
No. He never comes out once
that door is closed.

281
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,471
I did some searching on my way here,

282
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,510
and the price of this house
makes no sense.

283
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,934
Why did you search
for the price of this house?

284
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,769
Unlike my logic, my fingers
were searching.

285
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,604
You and I are not in the same class.

286
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,364
I'm going to be rude to this house today.

287
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,154
-Hi.
-Hi.

288
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,645
I'm sleeping over today.

289
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,783
You're taking medication now,
so donât drink.

290
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,911
I'm going inside.

291
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,004
Yes.

292
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,841
You're cursing with your eyes.

293
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,694
Some jerk told me
it's over between me and him.

294
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,059
He said I'm out.

295
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,693
I said that, but when I heard that againâ¦

296
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,818
it broke my heart.

297
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,992
It's good that you learned
how hurtful those words are.

298
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,084
If you were heartbroken
after hearing that,

299
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,039
it means you like him.

300
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,166
Were you heartbroken

301
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,968
when I said that?

302
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,181
No.

303
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,301
Not at all.

304
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,064
As you know, we don't like each other.

305
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,614
This isn't the end.

306
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,491
This other jerkâ¦

307
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,738
said I want nothing,

308
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,372
I have no goals,

309
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,909
and I have no desires.

310
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,210
I think it's ridiculous.

311
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,249
That's how you want people to see you.

312
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,837
If he doesn't want people
to see you like that,

313
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,842
it means he likes you.

314
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,676
Why are you talking like
you know everything?

315
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,990
Eun-jooâ¦

316
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,607
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,577
It may be serious enough for you
to come all the way here,

318
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,207
but it sounds unimportant to me.

319
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,542
It's unimportant. Yes.

320
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,883
To be honestâ¦

321
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,722
I came to see you
every time something happened.

322
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,389
And every time I did that,

323
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,433
you never comforted me.

324
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,892
I know that so well,

325
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,018
so why do I

326
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,397
always think of you?

327
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,111
The words of comfort

328
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
are sweet for a short moment,

329
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,160
but your hurtful words,

330
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,832
disgusting words,

331
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,290
and critical wordsâ¦

332
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,327
make me react to them a few days later,

333
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,245
and give me the strength to get back up.

334
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,375
You take care of your things
on your own now.

335
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,795
I'm not going to give you
any more advice.

336
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,336
Playing a villain is so exhausting.

337
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,555
How can a big sister
not advise a little sisterâ¦

338
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,111
I get that you're not a villain.

339
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,688
I'll be good to you.

340
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,073
Even if you got itâ¦

341
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,605
You can't fix it.

342
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,532
Wellâ¦

343
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,823
That may be true.

344
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,374
You're right, I canât fix it.

345
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,204
Butâ¦

346
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,384
stillâ¦

347
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,166
Having a change in family relations

348
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,586
or being estrangedâ¦

349
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,088
Don't say anything like that.

350
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,679
It's disgusting.

351
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,716
Todayâ¦

352
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,385
I came simply because I wanted to see you.

353
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,440
Really,

354
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,935
suddenly,

355
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,114
I wanted to see you so much.

356
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,414
I couldn't tell Dad.

357
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,406
It's fine if you can't tell him.

358
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,422
By the wayâ¦

359
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,630
About that bankbook

360
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,757
that went here and thereâ¦

361
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,762
How much is in it?

362
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,139
Why are you curious about that money?

363
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,943
You and I are not in the same class.

364
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,944
My ears are open to the mention of money.

365
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,200
Can Dadâ¦

366
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,317
Get a place to stay?

367
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,989
He still hasn't found a place to stay?

368
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,961
Then where is he staying now?

369
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,417
Goodness.

370
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,502
I know, right?

371
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,295
I donât know.

372
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,638
I hated that house so much.

373
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,855
The room was small,

374
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,896
the floor was bumpy,

375
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,994
I could smell the sewer,

376
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,992
and there were too many
dogs in the neighborhood.

377
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,498
The doggies in that neighborhood

378
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,459
all played with me.

379
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,750
The rain leaked into the house in summer,

380
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,174
and it was cold in winter.

381
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,339
I miss the bulgogi Mom cooked at the time.

382
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,134
The bulgogi with spinach and cabbage,

383
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,677
so she could save money for the meat.

384
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,471
That recipe is so modern-style.

385
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,732
Dad loved it.

386
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,442
He said he only likes Mom's food,

387
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,483
and he made her make lunch boxes for him.

388
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,105
Why do memories show our personalities?

389
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,671
Eun-joo. Be honest with me.

390
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,955
Have you ever dated anyone?

391
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,170
Passionately?

392
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,424
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

393
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,183
You never did, of course.

394
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,144
You know nothing about my relationships.

395
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,312
So you did?

396
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,888
Go to sleep.

397
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,359
You did, right?

398
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,189
Tell me. I'm listening.

399
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,232
-Ji-woo.
-Yes?

400
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,150
Go shoot an insert. With Seo-young.

401
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,110
-I can do it by myself.
-What do you need?

402
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,788
I'll do it.

403
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,256
You looked so happy
to get out of the office.

404
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,224
Something wrong?

405
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,644
You don't need to know.

406
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,682
I checked your social media page, andâ¦

407
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,768
And? What?

408
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,613
You only uploaded photos
of Chan-hyuk looking handsome,

409
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,189
but why did you upload photos of me
looking like this?

410
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,106
The CEO is handsome.

411
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,163
If you saw my social media page,

412
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,412
I'm sure you know now
from reading the comments.

413
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,540
My nickname is something, isn't it?

414
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,043
A crazy ex who acts like
a rape victim because she got

415
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,745
dumped by her boyfriend.

416
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,921
"You look well."

417
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,756
"Unboxing products will be sold out."

418
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,931
"You got prettier. Cheer up."

419
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,720
You don't read those comments?

420
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,271
"I'm hurt."
"I'm going to go out of control."

421
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,060
Don't do that to those who like you.

422
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,805
I'm not like Chan-hyuk.

423
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,607
Forgiving you because of your scarsâ¦

424
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,230
That doesn't work for me.

425
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,817
I'm going to treat you the same.

426
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,118
Those who like me?

427
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,661
Are you included in them?

428
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,383
I thought all guys your age
are all stupid losers,

429
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,800
but you're slightly okay.

430
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,669
It's all thanks to your sisters.

431
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,926
Why is it thanks to my sisters
that I'm okay?

432
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,717
I'm okay because I'm okay.

433
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,184
You stupid loser.

434
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,401
He's coming.

435
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,693
Shall I drive?

436
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,685
Itâs okay. Butâ¦

437
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,607
There are materials in the back seat,

438
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,606
so it'll be uncomfortable for you to sit.

439
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,528
Shall I go to the back seat?

440
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,446
I'll go to the back seat.

441
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,445
It's right for me to go to the back seat.

442
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,747
-Sit here, please.
-Okay, thank you.

443
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,263
You can just accompany us to a few places,

444
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,630
and we can go to small places on our own.

445
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,138
That's for me to decide.

446
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,522
A call from Youngest Brat.

447
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,490
Hey, Eun-hee. Are you busy?

448
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,778
I'm busy. Finish it in 30 seconds.

449
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,327
30 seconds?

450
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,576
What is it? Hurry up and say it.

451
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,292
You seeâ¦

452
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,963
Someone who works with meâ¦

453
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,173
It's me, Seo-young.

454
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,752
She wants to talk to you.

455
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,668
Hi.

456
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,337
I saw the texts
you and CEO Chan-hyuk exchanged.

457
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,546
I said those things mindlessly.

458
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,346
The CEO didn't tell me about it.
He never did.

459
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,113
Eun-hee. I don't understand
what she said, but she said so.

460
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,652
Hey, why did Chan-hyuk
let her see his phoneâ¦

461
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,738
Okay, I got it. Bye.

462
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,325
What on earth is going on?

463
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,462
What text message
did you see between them?

464
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,786
I have to know in order to help you.

465
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,417
Here is the promotional material.

466
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,009
Please write a good article.

467
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,139
-We're counting on you.
-Okay.

468
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,351
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

469
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,813
To you,

470
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,444
I am an idiot who showed the stone
wall of Deoksugung Palace

471
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,772
to my friends, not knowing
that was a secret.

472
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,070
That's what I am to you.

473
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,492
Let's stop here.

474
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,806
When I let you borrow
my handkerchief for the first time,

475
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,482
you said you have to wash
the handkerchief before returning it,

476
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,312
so I hand washed it.

477
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,701
You came all the way here
to give this back.

478
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,951
Goodness.

479
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,665
Are you okay?

480
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,505
It's just a scratch.

481
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,925
It's not a big deal.

482
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,427
I wasn't asking about that.

483
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,098
You couldn't even walk well
that day like you were going to fall ill.

484
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,443
I thought about it.

485
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,485
I heardâ¦

486
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,236
nothing from you.

487
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,834
It looks like our eldest daughter
isnât going to tell me.

488
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,786
So don't tell her that you told me.

489
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,378
Don't tell anyone.

490
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,133
No secret remains a secret forever.

491
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,759
Why did you come back to your old self?

492
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:10,975
You should've kept quiet and lived your
life in the past like you don't remember.

493
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,270
Just like that strange
coffee shop back then,

494
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,818
you should've just enjoyed
your life like before.

495
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,991
I would've done that if I were you.

496
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,615
Let's do that.

497
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,790
It wasn't fun when I was there alone.

498
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,710
Let's all go together.

499
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,441
I loved my children so much.

500
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,114
There isn't any one-sided
love like this in the world.

501
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,403
Soâ¦

502
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,896
there are no regrets either.

503
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,655
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

504
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,236
You said you wanted to die
because that one-sided love is unfair.

505
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,867
I was an absolute idiot.

506
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,285
What's one-sided love about?

507
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,794
It's about madly loving the other
even if they don't know.

508
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,919
I don't think it's unfair anymore.

509
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,014
You must be happy.

510
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,880
I have no debt or regrets
regarding the kids.

511
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,222
I'm only indebtedâ¦

512
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,770
to you.

513
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,403
Soâ¦

514
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,076
Let's go.

515
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,886
Were you offended yesterday?

516
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,638
No.

517
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,898
Donât mind it.

518
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,805
I don't mind it either.

519
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,480
I said it so you would mind it.

520
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,870
What should I mind, exactly?

521
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,408
You said you don't want
a childish relationship.

522
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,453
Don't judge me based on weird rumors.

523
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,116
Think about what would change.

524
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,292
Think about what we can do together.
I wanted you to think about it.

525
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,683
Do you think I never thought about that?

526
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,390
Surprisingly enough,
I thought hard about it.

527
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,925
I thought about your
background and capability.

528
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,767
That's why you began

529
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,023
with an advantage.

530
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,652
I know I seem soft and easy to others.

531
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,826
I know how harmful, harsh,
and hurtful words can scar people,

532
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,659
so I can never say them.

533
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,253
Butâ¦

534
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,171
Someone who tells me that
I look like I have no goals or desires

535
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,455
right at my face, making an excuse

536
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,757
for it being advice and loveâ¦

537
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,928
cannot get points from me.

538
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,799
I didn't say you're soft and easy.

539
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,516
I felt like
I was completely out of your sight.

540
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,138
So I wanted to tell you to see me.

541
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,742
Donât try too hard to avoid

542
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,277
the same mistake in the past.

543
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,123
If it isn't because you totally hate me

544
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,503
or like someone else,

545
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I'm going to try more.

546
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,593
Because I know you're a wonderful person.

547
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,245
All right, let's do it this way.

548
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,464
Okay.

549
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,883
Eun-hee.

550
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,928
What was that call about?

551
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,351
Why did she look at someone else's phone?

552
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,971
Did Chan-hyuk let her do it?

553
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,638
It's not like they're dating.

554
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,136
Why let her take his phone?

555
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,308
I don't know.

556
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,274
Is everyone there?

557
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,479
Go outside and talk.

558
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,237
I don't have anything else
to tell you. That's all.

559
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,400
I don't know.

560
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,158
Hey, that's a crime.

561
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,870
Even families shouldn't
look at each other's phones.

562
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,411
Didn't he say anything to you?

563
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,294
It's not like she looked at your phone.
Why are you so angry?

564
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,964
Come here.

565
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,889
What the heck? Did you two do something?

566
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:42,313
I confessed to Ms. Eun-hee
about secretly looking at your phone.

567
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,274
Goodness.

568
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,834
How do you like it?

569
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,464
I saw young people with this
on the street,

570
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,212
so I wanted to try it too.

571
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,692
We were so happy
when we lived in the hillside village.

572
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,819
I guess we were the happiest
when we were the poorest.

573
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,951
Do you know when I started to

574
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:49,384
get angry with you with fire in my heart?

575
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,665
How should I know when the exact time was?

576
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,393
I just remember

577
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,557
you throwing things and yelling

578
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,232
out of the blue, at all times.

579
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,481
I know.

580
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,864
That book.

581
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,948
It's because of that book.

582
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,159
You were so focused on reading it,

583
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,406
I bought it and read it secretly too.

584
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,122
What book?

585
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,482
"In a universe of ambiguityâ¦"

586
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,073
"In a universe of ambiguity,

587
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,401
this certainty comes only once,

588
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,236
and never comes again."

589
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,704
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY

590
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,038
I read the part you underlined,

591
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,791
and though I'm uneducated,
I could understand what that meant.

592
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,538
I thoughtâ¦

593
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,755
you missed Eun-joo's father
your entire life.

594
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,264
That's when I became a loser.

595
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,054
Both of our lives

596
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,599
were all about misunderstandings.

597
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,677
CAN YOU TALK ON THE PHONE NOW?

598
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,555
CAN YOU TALK ON THE PHONE NOW?

599
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,153
CAN YOU TALK ON THE PHONE NOW?

600
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,914
I'M SORRY

601
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,680
Whenever there was work,

602
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,060
I worked from dawn to lunch
at a supermarket storage room.

603
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,018
I took a break

604
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,398
and then worked as a barista.

605
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,019
My life was so hard,

606
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,533
so I couldn't even think
of running away from the world.

607
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,868
So when I saw Dr. Yoon
running away to Goheung,

608
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,871
I got so angry,

609
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,207
so I behaved badly.

610
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,248
His life, which seems
easy and comfortable to youâ¦

611
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,129
It's not easy to throw those away, either.

612
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,891
I didn't think about that.

613
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,310
Still, I'm sure you hated him

614
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,599
because he seemed like
a big coward to you.

615
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,233
I have so many cowards around me.

616
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,317
I didn't suddenly start hating him.

617
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,778
I'm going to New Zealand.

618
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,447
I know it's reckless,
but I decided to be with him

619
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,407
and live happily, once more.

620
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,254
Please tell him this.

621
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,174
Me?

622
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,085
I don't think I'll ever tell him.

623
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,144
If you're not going to protect
him like a baby forever,

624
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,472
tell him.

625
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,980
He'll realize his emotions.

626
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,188
It's my last gift.

627
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,562
EUN-HEE'S

628
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,780
NO NEED FOR LOVE

629
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,203
I KNEW I'D END UP LOVING YOU

630
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,121
What's with all of these titles?

631
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,168
TALKATIVE WOMAN, UNTALKATIVE WOMEN
KIM EUN-HEE

632
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,339
I have desires too.

633
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,564
Was someone here?

634
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,949
Barista Ahn isâ¦

635
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,670
leaving for New Zealand tomorrow.

636
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,626
I said my last goodbye to him.

637
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,774
Hi.

638
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,189
Why won't you answer Attorney Lee's calls?

639
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,816
Ma'am.

640
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,573
Talk with me. He's a bit drunk.

641
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,405
Let me ask you one thing.

642
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,241
Did you come up
with the alimony that was billed?

643
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,410
Yes.

644
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,867
I calculated it.

645
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,076
Calculatedâ¦

646
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,917
Money shows the worst part
of a human being.

647
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,005
We're strangers now,
so I don't want to quarrel with you.

648
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,801
It's right to talk with family.

649
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,654
Open the door.

650
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,689
Avoiding it isn't the way.

651
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,073
If you avoid it,
things will get more complicated.

652
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,820
Open the door.

653
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,634
What is it?

654
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,920
He usually doesn't drink
until he gets drunk,

655
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,721
and he doesn't do that, eitherâ¦

656
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,144
I said, what is it?

657
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,233
He got dumped.

658
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,732
I didn't know, butâ¦

659
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,766
I guess he liked him a lot.

660
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,066
Youâ¦

661
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,663
Youâ¦

662
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,739
How could you say that to meâ¦

663
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,248
with that face, like it's nothingâ¦

664
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,211
Are you doing that on purpose?

665
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,670
Because it's true.

666
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,957
Ma'am.

667
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,959
Youâ¦

668
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,804
you love him.

669
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,007
You keep ignoring it

670
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,563
and act like you don't know.
Do you feel nothing?

671
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,313
Is it that difficult to see him
as who he is? Iâ¦

672
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,530
I can accept him now.

673
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,080
It should be easier for you than for me.

674
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:57,106
CAN YOU TALK ON THE PHONE?

675
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,285
Can you talk on the phone?

676
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,925
I came to ask you something.

677
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,063
I did my laundry with a washing machine,

678
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,980
but the unpleasant smell won't go away.

679
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,693
Aren't you getting in?

680
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,665
At that time we ordered
one double portion and shared it.

681
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,001
You told me to eat more

682
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,757
and I told you to eat more,

683
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,680
and the noodles got soggy.

684
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,009
I came to ask you something.

685
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,919
I made stir-fried anchovies,

686
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,338
but they're so hard and I can't chew them.

687
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,412
Hey!

688
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,535
Come and get me!

689
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,249
Take it easy.

690
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,918
Why are you so good?

691
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,404
Bye.

692
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,150
Ms. Sook.

693
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,909
How about we goâ¦

694
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,906
on a real date next time?

695
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,044
Yes?

696
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:40,121
It's your day off,
so take care of your own meals.

697
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,036
I'm coming home after eating dinner.

698
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,125
From Mom.

699
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,999
Wait a secondâ¦

700
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,126
What is this?

701
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,678
Ms. Lee the penny pincher bought clothes?

702
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,209
This is obviously a stuffed toy
from a crane machine.

703
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,477
Do you like radish?

704
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,898
Three types of radish kimchi
are delivered.

705
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,898
They are at your door now.

706
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,259
Stop acting.
How would you bring all those here?

707
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,180
Don't try to let it pass.
I'm not letting off steam this time.

708
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,567
I know. I'd do the same too.

709
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,605
I didnât want this to happen again,

710
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,864
so I thought of holding it back.

711
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,660
I couldn't hold it back,

712
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,776
but I kept holding it back.

713
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,743
See?

714
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,908
You've been thinking
I have the worst kind of personality.

715
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,038
No.

716
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,125
This time, I had
another emotion mixed into it.

717
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,551
And it was Seo-young
who delivered the words,

718
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,762
so I believed it wholly and got angrier.

719
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,387
Seo-young shines brightly.

720
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,640
She's pretty, flamboyant, and honest.

721
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,473
And more than anything, she likes you.

722
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,598
She's not lacking anything.

723
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,436
"I get it."

724
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,571
"They're close enough
to share everything."

725
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,068
"I hope they can be together."

726
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,440
My emotions went that far.

727
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,914
For being out of control aloneâ¦

728
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,457
you held back pretty well.

729
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,253
I know, right?

730
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,134
Gosh.

731
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:37,012
Hey. I even made such
an embarrassing confession.

732
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,431
Let me go inside, at least.

733
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,856
Kkakdugi for Kimbap. Kimbap for Ramen.

734
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,478
Altari kimchi for ramen.
Kimbap for Altari kimchi.

735
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:57,066
If you consume carbohydrates
in an infinite cycle,

736
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,533
your brain experiences sweetness.

737
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,540
The apology event lacks
sincerity and it's cliched.

738
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,625
Wrong.

739
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,129
If you accepted the apology,
then it's game over.

740
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,602
You must be really sorry.
You can't even look me in the eye.

741
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,687
Let's go outside after.
I have things to say.

742
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,268
You also need to get out
of this place at times.

743
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,422
Why are you making sad eyes
like you're never coming back here?

744
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,928
You're so keen.

745
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:17,528
I told Ms. Kim Eun-hee
that we slept together on our last day.

746
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,648
But it's too quiet.

747
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,276
It's too quiet,

748
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,162
so I wondered if you don't know about it.

749
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,740
Is she an awesome woman who doesn't care
and doesn't ask about it?

750
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,099
Since the day I met you
at the meditation center and until now,

751
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,520
all of my behavior

752
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,810
had a reason.

753
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,105
I was so happy to see you again.

754
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,276
Let's eat soup and rice.

755
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,068
I'm in.

756
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,040
Let's go eat soup and rice.

757
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,328
"So our friendship can instantly overcome"

758
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,462
"the time we haven't kept in touch."

759
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,456
I don't want to add something

760
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,962
to this simple emotion.

761
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,047
"I will not lose this assuring
and stable friendliness again."

762
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,297
I even promised myself.

763
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,771
What are you doing?

764
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,767
How did you get here?

765
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,649
When I went to see you
and told you everything,

766
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,568
it was to set the boundaries as friends,

767
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,029
not as man and woman.

768
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,573
It was a promise to myself
that I'll never make any changes

769
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,947
to this relationship.

770
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,210
It was that meaningful?

771
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,500
So you told me
about your mistake with Mr. Playboy

772
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,257
to prevent us from having a relationship
between man and woman?

773
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,340
Did I get it right?

774
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,800
Yes.

775
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,313
Personal safe. Emptying the trash can.
A class about playboys.

776
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,690
It wasn't about that.

777
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,693
In that case, what you mean is

778
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,442
that I can never date you

779
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,534
because you made a mistake
with another man

780
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,450
and because I'm too small-minded.

781
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,605
Right?

782
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:30,737
What?

783
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,035
That's not what it is.

784
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,577
I'm the one who canât.

785
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,710
I can never be
in a romantic relationship with you

786
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,802
since I told you everything in detail.

787
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,506
It's not that youâre small-minded.

788
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,138
It's just that I canât.

789
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,106
I get it.

790
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,396
I get it so clearly.

791
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,185
What's with that look?

792
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,834
When I said I'll peep at you,

793
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,789
keep your smile in my heart

794
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,579
and look at it before going to sleep.

795
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,962
Was that too uncomfortable?

796
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,668
You said you did everything when you were
20 years old like it was nothing,

797
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,206
so why draw boundaries?

798
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,267
Aren't you glad you got out of the office?

799
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,772
What nice weather.

800
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,502
Hi.

801
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,668
Did he quit working here?

802
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:08,508
Yes.

803
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,339
He went to New Zealand.

804
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,426
I'm super jealous.

805
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,008
What's with Mom?

806
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,517
Momâ¦

807
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,100
kicked Dad out completely.

808
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,595
She moved to the main bedroom.
Dad's room is gone.

809
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,186
And Momâ¦

810
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,687
is having a fling.

811
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,624
He must be giving her flowers
every time they meet.

812
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,540
Don't tell me she played
a crane machine game.

813
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,011
And I think it'sâ¦

814
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,552
Mr. Yoo.

815
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,144
-So what?
-So what?

816
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,428
Why are you tattling on it to us?
How childish.

817
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,057
Can't Mom have a boyfriend?

818
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,404
Do you not keep secrets?

819
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,226
Why? Why are you looking at me?

820
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,030
You have something.

821
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,322
I knew it. You have a secret too.

822
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,450
I have a secret.

823
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,792
I'm sure Eun-hee does too.

824
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,995
It's not like families
have to know everything.

825
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,921
Let's keep the boundaries.

826
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,629
No, I can't keep the boundaries.
What is it? What's your secret?

827
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,217
Eun-joo told us to keep the boundaries.

828
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,301
Your leg is shaking.

829
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,715
It's a habit.

830
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,430
Tae-hyung.

831
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,346
Tae-hyung.

832
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,692
How are you doing?

833
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,902
-Good.
-Good.

834
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,936
Did you have lunch?

835
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,530
Yes.

836
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:56,819
What would you like to drink?

837
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,236
Yes, the same one, please.

838
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,792
Eun-joo and Tae-hyung

839
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,588
look like they're
at their best these days.

840
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,223
Really?

841
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,676
I was an idiot to listen and believe you
that Mom is having a fling.

842
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,221
Why? It's true.

843
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,095
Whether it's true or false,

844
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,562
let's just cheer for the lives of
Mom and Dad so they can be free.

845
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,939
I didn't say anything.

846
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,653
I just

847
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,436
made an excuse, so I can see Eun-joo.

848
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,200
-Right, about Seo-youngâ¦
-Please.

849
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,242
It was just a mistake.

850
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,736
Just let it pass.

851
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,865
Why are you defending her?

852
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,047
Eun-hee.

853
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,092
What?

854
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:02,262
Have you ever wondered why Chan-hyuk
doesn't have a driver's license?

855
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,150
Ms. Jin-sook.

856
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,617
The green light is on.

857
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,616
You may cross the street.

858
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,665
Ms. Jin-sook.

859
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,287
It's not too late, is it?

860
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,506
You're smiling.

861
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,126
Mr. Sang-sik!

862
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:24,917
Can Iâ¦

863
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,090
love you again?

864
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:02,462
Mom, what was the first thing you planned
to do after graduating from marriage?

865
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,127
Don't you think you're too indifferent
to your friend's family story?

866
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:15,635
Give me a chance
to be your personal safe for once.

867
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,314
-Dad.
-Hey, get in!

868
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,694
I behaved like a kid that day.

869
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,185
I forgot to say something important.

870
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,858
Don't tell the kids.

871
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:34,913
