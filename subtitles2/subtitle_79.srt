00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:29,236
At two-and-a-half minutes before midnight

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,961
on the 12th of March 1928,

6
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:35,518
the lights in Los Angeles flickered.

7
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:40,695
William Mulholland was asleep
at his home near Windsor Square.

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,766
He didn't notice.

9
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,632
Mulholland runs an agency

10
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,979
that is in charge of providing water

11
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,913
for Los Angeles.

12
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,778
He's a civil servant.

13
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:56,918
Nonetheless, he's extraordinarily powerful,

14
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:59,093
and he knows it.

15
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,028
Mulholland is the man who brought

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,134
water to the city of Los Angeles.

17
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,825
With the aqueduct,

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,483
with the dams,

19
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:14,004
he forges Los Angeles into a major city.

20
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:19,907
Meanwhile, in a
canyon 40 miles northwest of the city,

21
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,598
Ace Hopewell pulled his motorcycle

22
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:25,568
to the side of the road.

23
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,640
He passed the St. Francis Dam
about a mile back,

24
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:31,194
Mulholland's most recent creation:

25
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,094
a wall of concrete 20 stories high

26
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,613
holding back 12 billion gallons of water.

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,308
As he lit a cigarette,

28
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,311
Hopewell heard a sound in the distance.

29
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:53,837
The St. Francis Dam
was collapsing.

30
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:56,357
It's 54 miles to the ocean.

31
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,360
As many as 10,000 people

32
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,949
are downstream from this.

33
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:04,331
They could actually feel the vibration

34
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:06,712
and they could hear it coming.

35
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:09,439
It felt like an earthquake.

36
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,096
They saw their neighbors running out.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,236
And then they realized.

38
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,791
But by that time,
the water was just upon them.

39
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,655
Most of the people who were killed

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,350
probably never knew what
was happening to them.

41
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:28,389
That wall of water carried bodies

42
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,977
out to the Pacific Ocean.

43
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,213
It was one of the
worst civil engineering disasters

44
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,121
in American history,

45
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,365
rooted in a national drive

46
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:42,576
to harness nature and remake the West.

47
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,887
The question is not whether

48
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,722
water should have been brought
to Los Angeles,

49
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:49,928
but rather how it was done.

50
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,966
Because the consequences
are so devastating.

51
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,003
When infrastructure fails,

52
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:00,180
engineers use the disaster
to learn from and rebuild.

53
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,079
But the failure of the
St. Francis Dam is as much

54
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:05,875
a social-political story as it is

55
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,533
an engineering story.

56
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,707
And when there's a social disaster,

57
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:15,747
we need to think about, where
did we go wrong as a society?

58
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:38,942
When I was a young boy,

59
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:43,533
my parents would always warn me
not to go to the river.

60
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:48,055
They would tell the story of La Llorona,

61
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,644
the woman that would be crying
along the riverbed,

62
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,921
searching for her children.

63
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,412
There's definitely a haunting
of the river even to this day.

64
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:06,591
And I never understood until I
was much older

65
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,111
why there were ghosts along the
Santa Clara River.

66
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,545
The St. Francis Dam disaster

67
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,342
began in a flush of hope.

68
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:37,346
On a perfect November morning in 1913,

69
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,143
40,000 Angelenos gathered at a
new landmark called the Cascades

70
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:48,011
to inaugurate one of the wonders
of the modern world.

71
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:51,152
The Los Angeles Aqueduct
was a perfect emblem

72
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,672
for the city of tomorrow:

73
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,744
more than 200 miles of pipes and canals

74
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,645
carrying enough water for
two-and-a-half million people,

75
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,164
ten times the current population,

76
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,067
from the Sierra Nevada Mountains
to the outskirts of the city.

77
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:15,349
The aqueduct
does hail a new beginning for Los Angeles.

78
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:19,905
It very much follows on the idea
of Manifest Destiny,

79
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,493
but now it's not just about land.

80
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,115
It's about controlling the resources

81
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,429
to make the American West
the kind of civilization

82
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:29,432
they want it to be, the kind of
place that they want it to be.

83
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,713
The "Los Angeles Times" proclaimed,

84
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,475
"A mighty river has been brought out

85
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,272
from the mountain wilderness, an
inexhaustible supply of water."

86
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,378
And there was more.

87
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:47,761
They realized that they could use this flow

88
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,385
to turn generators and generate
90% of the electricity

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,561
that was needed by Los Angeles.

90
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:58,323
With ample water and clean power,

91
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,981
L.A. would lead the way
to a better future,

92
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,811
far from the crowded cities of the East.

93
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,367
"No black pillars of smoke

94
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,473
shall blind the sun,"
the "L.A. Times" promised,

95
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:13,718
"no army of grimy workers

96
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,687
"shall feed the red-mouthed furnaces,

97
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:21,001
"for the river, bound with hoops of steel,

98
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:25,454
shall generate the power
for numberless industries."

99
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:29,458
"We will be a modern city.

100
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:30,966
"We're not going to be like
those older places

101
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,564
"that have these older social problems.

102
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,601
We can remake ourselves
in this new way."

103
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:38,881
Having, quote-unquote,
"ended the frontier era,"

104
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:44,473
the West is now going to be

105
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,855
won or lost through its cities.

106
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:54,828
The rise of faith in the city,
it's very optimistic.

107
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,211
The mastermind behind the aqueduct

108
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,903
was the head of the Los Angeles Bureau

109
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,112
of Water Works and Supply,

110
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:07,427
an Irish immigrant who never
finished grade school.

111
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,603
"Well, I went to school in
Ireland when I was a boy,"

112
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:14,572
William Mulholland told a reporter,

113
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:17,264
"learned the three Rs
and the Ten Commandments...

114
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:20,716
"or most of them... made a
pilgrimage to the Blarney Stone,

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,272
received my father's blessing,
and here I am."

116
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,722
He starts out

117
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:27,861
as a ditch digger.

118
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,932
I mean, you can't start out any lower,

119
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,381
you know, than that.

120
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,108
But that's what made him such
a good field general.

121
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,284
He understands the working man

122
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,113
and how to marshal their efforts.

123
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,875
That was what he lived for.

124
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,808
Angelenos really loved him

125
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:47,846
because he was a working-class
immigrant who had made good.

126
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,746
He was the hearty Irishman,

127
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,438
the man of the people.

128
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,338
But the settlers in the Owens River Valley,

129
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,306
the source of L.A.'s water,

130
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,516
saw William Mulholland very differently.

131
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:07,556
As far as they were concerned,
he was taking their river,

132
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,973
leaving farms and towns
to wither on the vine.

133
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,321
They had been kept in the dark
about the aqueduct

134
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:18,705
as the city quietly bought
up their land and water rights.

135
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:23,399
The Owens Valley
was a rural, high-desert community

136
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:27,852
that had begun settled by
Euro Americans in the 1860s.

137
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:32,442
Their fortunes were tied
to the Owens River.

138
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:35,549
The water wasn't stolen,

139
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:39,795
but it was not acquired all
in the up-and-up.

140
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,649
They certainly didn't tell
them that their plan really

141
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,626
was to run the water down to Los Angeles.

142
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:46,560
The anger in the Owens Valley

143
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:49,114
would haunt Mulholland to his grave,

144
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,049
but for most Angelenos,
any qualms about the project

145
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:56,639
were eclipsed by its
breathtaking scale and ambition.

146
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,577
It is a gargantuan construction project:

147
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:08,755
placing metal aqueduct structures

148
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,998
in and around valleys,

149
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,897
arroyos, sheer mountains,

150
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,382
long, flat, dry expanses

151
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,040
of the California landscape.

152
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,180
It's astonishing.

153
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,100
To think that you could bring that water

154
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:47,310
over 200 miles, that's just
extraordinary at the time.

155
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:49,209
It would be a huge project today.

156
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:55,664
On that November day in 1913,

157
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:56,965
when Angelenos gathered at the Cascades

158
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,323
to celebrate the opening of the aqueduct,

159
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:04,155
they were captivated by
the city's glittering future.

160
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,367
Shortly after 1:00 p.m.,

161
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,335
Owens River water
was released down the Cascades

162
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,165
for the first time.

163
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,140
The people just rushed toward the water.

164
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:27,385
They had brought tin cups to dip

165
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,214
into the water as it was coming down,

166
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,354
to drink the first water
from this man-made river.

167
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:36,532
As the crowd
rushed to marvel at their new river,

168
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,569
Mulholland perfectly captured the moment.

169
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:42,469
"There it is," he shouted from the stage.

170
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:45,575
"Take it."

171
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,795
The aqueduct was a game changer.

172
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,763
It made Los Angeles

173
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,593
the fastest-growing city in the
United States.

174
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,046
The aqueduct teaches Los Angeles that

175
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,704
it can do bold and amazing things.

176
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,533
Suburbs are springing up all over,

177
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,294
and migrants are pouring into Los Angeles.

178
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,747
It was a moment of great excitement.

179
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,785
That's not to say this works for everybody

180
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,718
by any stretch of the imagination.

181
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:28,964
There's racial segregation
in law and in practice.

182
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:31,656
There's violence meted out to non-whites.

183
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,727
So, it's not a alchemy

184
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:38,042
of fulfillment and happiness
that spreads to everybody.

185
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:41,631
But the mythic qualities of it
are palpable.

186
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:49,053
The dream was: come here,
perhaps start anew.

187
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,162
But as Los Angeles boomed,

188
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,200
Southern California was drying up.

189
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:01,479
By the time the population
blew past the one million mark

190
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,172
in the early 1920s,
the aqueduct flow had been cut

191
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,555
almost in half by years of drought.

192
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,733
Just think about it:
they were looking out 50 years,

193
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,114
and they were out of water in ten.

194
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,808
Surprise, surprise.

195
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,040
That's what California is full of.

196
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,327
It's full of surprises.

197
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:26,193
What Mulholland created
was an illusion of abundance.

198
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:30,059
And so, the people of the city
of Los Angeles

199
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,267
keep using more water

200
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:35,996
instead of responding
to drought conditions.

201
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:39,379
There are lawns everywhere.

202
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:44,142
Spectacular flower gardens.

203
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:47,456
The amount of water poured onto those lawns

204
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,044
is pretty astounding.

205
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,427
In order
to quench L.A.'s thirst,

206
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,705
the Bureau of Water went on
another buying spree

207
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,810
in the Owens Valley,

208
00:12:56,845 --> 00:13:00,296
laying claim to most of the remaining water

209
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,852
and further undermining
the region's economy.

210
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,613
There's a tremendous amount of anger

211
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:08,373
growing in the Owens Valley.

212
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:12,688
There's a sense that the community

213
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,449
is really being destroyed.

214
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,837
To see this distant city

215
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:27,772
turning into a glamorous metropolis...

216
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:32,397
...and using their water,

217
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,572
must have been incredibly frustrating.

218
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,575
Arrogance absolutely plays a big role.

219
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:42,649
There is a lot of resentment
that is driven by the decisions

220
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:47,136
and the attitudes of people
like Mulholland.

221
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,624
The farmers in the Owens River Valley

222
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,870
weren't perceived as equal citizens.

223
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,734
They are imperial subjects.

224
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:03,428
The anger only
deepened when it became clear

225
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:06,086
that much of the Owens River water

226
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,640
wasn't going to Los Angeles at all.

227
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,160
Even as the rest of Southern California

228
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,300
was drying up, the city was providing

229
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,233
vast amounts of water to farms

230
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:17,649
and orchards in the San Fernando Valley,

231
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:21,619
which belonged in large part to a syndicate

232
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,691
of the most powerful men in the city.

233
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:27,728
Did the city really
need to provide landowners

234
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,317
in the San Fernando Valley
with that much water?

235
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:35,150
Well, it turns out that the
owner of the "Los Angeles Times"

236
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:39,809
and some other associates
have bought a lot of land there.

237
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:45,263
Those wealthy landowners made a killing.

238
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,474
It's very easy
to picture Mulholland as corrupt,

239
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:53,513
but he wasn't doing this because
he was getting paid off to do it

240
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:56,654
or he was making money off of it.

241
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,314
I think, for him,
it's really about his own vision

242
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:04,006
and his power and his ability

243
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,284
to remake nature.

244
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,909
I think that's what's driving him.

245
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,325
The threat of shortages

246
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:17,261
accelerated the next phase
in Mulholland's master plan.

247
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,471
In a dry year,

248
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,957
if there isn't a lot of snow
in the Sierra Nevada,

249
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:28,134
the aqueduct won't deliver
as much water to Los Angeles.

250
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:29,756
So they need storage,

251
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,208
big reservoir, so you could fill
it up in the wet years,

252
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:37,453
and in the dry years, it'll tide you over.

253
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:40,180
In the summer of 1922,

254
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:42,976
Mulholland decided to build seven new dams

255
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,013
near the southern end of the aqueduct,

256
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:48,568
including a pair of majestic
concrete structures

257
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,674
worthy of a great metropolis:

258
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,333
the Hollywood Dam, in the hills
overlooking Los Angeles,

259
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:58,647
and biggest of all,
the St. Francis Dam,

260
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:03,272
in a canyon 40 miles northwest of the city.

261
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,643
The St. Francis
Dam and the Hollywood Dam

262
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:08,381
are similar structures;
they were both built

263
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,866
with the same design,

264
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,665
a tribute to engineering triumph
and the control of nature,

265
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,563
and it's impossible not to think

266
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:20,980
that he saw it as a tribute
to him, as well.

267
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,914
Plans were drawn up in Mulholland's offices

268
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:27,503
in the fall of 1922.

269
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,368
20 years before, the city had required

270
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:34,131
that a group of experts review
his plans for the aqueduct.

271
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,893
But that was then.

272
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:39,032
This is that sense

273
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:41,379
that he had earned the right

274
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:46,108
to sort of do what he wanted to do.

275
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:48,283
This is the
second-largest storage reservoir

276
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,630
in Southern California.

277
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:54,392
It should have had peer review;

278
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,843
at least some people outside
his organization reviewing it

279
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,293
and looking at it.

280
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:04,540
But nobody's questioning him
by the time you get to 1922.

281
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,128
Nobody.

282
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:16,276
In April of 1924,

283
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,313
the first construction workers arrived

284
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:21,143
in the San Francisquito Canyon.

285
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,905
It had been 12 years
since Mulholland's crews

286
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,494
ran the southern end of
the aqueduct through here,

287
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:28,840
and three years

288
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,625
since they finished building
a generating station

289
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,327
called Powerhouse 2

290
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:37,332
about a mile downstream from the new dam.

291
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:41,370
The Powerhouse 2 workers and their families

292
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,614
lived in wooden bungalows
clustered around the plant

293
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,409
at the bottom of the canyon.

294
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,446
Now their quiet little community

295
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,209
was overrun with men and machinery.

296
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:55,039
But just as the project was gearing up,

297
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,869
it suddenly took on a new urgency.

298
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,943
On the 21st of May 1924,

299
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,394
a massive explosion destroyed a section

300
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,742
of the aqueduct in Owens Valley.

301
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,987
The damage was repaired within a few days,

302
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:15,818
but as far as the activists
in the valley were concerned,

303
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,442
the fight was just getting started.

304
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:23,481
The aqueduct
was a disaster for Owens Valley.

305
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:28,383
The people who lived there
lost almost all of their water.

306
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:34,147
It became such a desolate place.

307
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,907
It was a complete undoing

308
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,358
of their livelihoods and their households

309
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:41,568
and their families.

310
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:46,953
To the city
and to Mulholland, this is terrorism.

311
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,542
You are destroying the water supply

312
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,786
for this major urban center.

313
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,375
Six months after the first attack,

314
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,136
over a hundred men seized

315
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,103
the aqueduct control gates in Owens Valley,

316
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,761
opened up the valves,

317
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:05,144
and released the water
onto the parched soil.

318
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,563
They wouldn't restore
the aqueduct flow, they said,

319
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:13,359
until the city agreed to pay reparations

320
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:16,914
and limit any further expansion
of the project.

321
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,098
By noon the next day, hundreds
of men, women, and children

322
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,514
had joined the siege,

323
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:34,207
which had come to look more
like a huge barbecue.

324
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:40,006
Families came with picnics,

325
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,975
businesses up and down the
valley closed for the occasion,

326
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,668
and a group of musicians arrived,

327
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,497
courtesy of movie star Tom Mix,

328
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:51,397
who was shooting a Western nearby.

329
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:54,676
The siege lasted four days,

330
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,645
long enough to make news around the world.

331
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:02,718
To Mulholland's annoyance,

332
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,963
much of the coverage presented
the settlers' actions

333
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,345
as a noble struggle against the corruption

334
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,347
and power of Los Angeles.

335
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:21,841
It became known
in the press as "the Little Civil War."

336
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,708
And it was intense, and it was violent.

337
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:30,298
There are multiple layers of irony here.

338
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,059
When the settlers of the Owens Valley

339
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:37,408
came in the 1850s and '60s,

340
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:40,100
they displaced the Northern Paiute people,

341
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:44,898
the Native people
who lived in the Owens Valley.

342
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,420
Before contact,

343
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:51,388
the Paiutes' homeland had stretched across

344
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:55,150
30 million acres of the Western interior.

345
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:58,602
Although most preferred a
nomadic lifestyle,

346
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:01,432
one group settled in Owens Valley,

347
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:05,022
where the snowmelt coming off
the Sierra Nevada Mountains

348
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,507
provided a reliable source of water.

349
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:10,890
The Paiutes there,
they were building irrigation canals

350
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,720
going back to 1000 A.D.,

351
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,308
so they could take the runoff

352
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:17,172
from the back side of the Sierra Nevada

353
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:20,175
and they could grow different
types of indigenous crops.

354
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,626
Of course, during the conquest,

355
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,836
there's an influx of white
Americans to the West Coast.

356
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,425
For the Owens Valley Paiute, in particular,

357
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:32,118
there's tension over kidnapping
of Paiute children

358
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,085
and other types of really atrocious things,

359
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,605
and there's a series of wars.

360
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,194
In the long run, it's,
it's the Paiute who are removed

361
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:41,921
from their ancestral lands
as the settlers come there

362
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,888
and basically take over the
irrigation system

363
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:48,065
that the Paiutes had built
a thousand years before.

364
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,999
So what the settlers did to Native people,

365
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:54,313
the City of Los Angeles
is in a sense doing to them:

366
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,729
taking the water away.

367
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:00,940
The Los Angeles Water Bureau picked up

368
00:22:00,974 --> 00:22:03,425
where the Paiute Wars left off,

369
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,808
insisting that any Paiutes
who remained in the valley

370
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:09,638
should be removed through a land swap

371
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:12,469
for humanitarian reasons.

372
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:17,991
"Some are living in dugouts
or crudely constructed shacks

373
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:20,891
that are a disgrace to American ideals,"

374
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:24,826
an internal report observed,
before coming to the point.

375
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,452
"Nearly all of them use
immense quantities of water."

376
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,661
Is it a morality tale?

377
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:35,250
It's always a morality tale.

378
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,735
But of course, it depends on whose morals

379
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,014
and whose perspective.

380
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,776
Dispossession is really woven into

381
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,295
the fabric of the American West.

382
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,228
It's the philosophy that

383
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,921
forms the entire foundation of
the settlement of the region.

384
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:12,425
By the fall of 1924,

385
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,601
the canyon was a hive of activity.

386
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,709
Trucks ferried sand and gravel

387
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:24,713
to a small concrete plant at
the downstream face of the dam.

388
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:34,965
A crane lifted the liquid concrete.

389
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:40,142
Workers directed it into position.

390
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:47,943
Over the next 16 months, that
same operation would be repeated

391
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,740
tens of thousands of times.

392
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:54,743
A gravity dam's a very simple concept.

393
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:57,056
It's a retaining wall that you're building

394
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,957
to have something of much
greater weight and stability

395
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,235
than the forces you're putting against it.

396
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,756
And this is water, this is concrete.

397
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,725
So a dam that has a triangular shape

398
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,763
should be able to hold back a
lake that's of infinite length.

399
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,077
As work proceeded on the dam,

400
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,148
Mulholland decided to make it taller

401
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:22,909
than originally planned.

402
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:25,118
Mulholland had made a promise

403
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,155
that he wanted enough storage

404
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:32,609
to contain one year's water
supply for Los Angeles.

405
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:37,372
Because the population was
increasing so much every year,

406
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:40,651
the demand was greater and greater.

407
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,170
And so Mulholland

408
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:45,449
increased the height of the dam ten feet

409
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,383
the first year that they were
in construction,

410
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,212
and then the second year, he did it again,

411
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,940
without increasing the base width.

412
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,528
What's important here is, okay,

413
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,933
you can raise the height of the dam.

414
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:59,221
But if you do this,

415
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:01,879
there's going to be more
pressure on the concrete,

416
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,699
and you better make sure that
it's thick enough

417
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,332
to withstand that.

418
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,992
In fact, Mulholland was distracted

419
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,995
by an even more ambitious enterprise.

420
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,377
The Boulder Dam project,

421
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,138
which becomes the Hoover Dam,

422
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:23,487
is an undertaking that
even dwarfs the aqueduct:

423
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:28,527
to take water from the
Colorado River, move it

424
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,117
to various places along
Southern California.

425
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:38,364
Mulholland is a consultant to that project.

426
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,022
It feeds into his vision of what

427
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:44,473
he thinks Southern California can become.

428
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:48,201
Even as the biggest dam he'd ever built

429
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:51,273
was rising in the San Francisquito Canyon,

430
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,242
Mulholland was on the road
for weeks at a time,

431
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,004
mapping out routes for
a Colorado River aqueduct

432
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,250
and lobbying in Sacramento and Washington.

433
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,635
All the while,
behind the St. Francis Dam,

434
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:11,224
the water was rising,
the pressure building.

435
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:17,161
When it's completed in the spring of 1926,

436
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:20,233
there's almost no public notice of it.

437
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,132
There are a number of dynamite attacks

438
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,169
that take place along the aqueduct.

439
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:28,794
I think they don't want
to draw attention to it.

440
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:32,694
The official
reticence did nothing to pacify

441
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:35,317
the settlers in the Owens Valley.

442
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:39,287
On May 27, 1927, an explosion

443
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,360
ripped out one of the largest
siphons in the aqueduct.

444
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,327
A few nights later,

445
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:48,434
another 60-foot section was destroyed.

446
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,126
By the end of June, there had been

447
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:53,232
three more attacks on the aqueduct,

448
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:55,683
and the city was alive
with rumors of a plot

449
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:58,340
to bomb the St. Francis Dam.

450
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,896
The authorities had yet
to make a single arrest.

451
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,658
No one in the valley was talking.

452
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:09,524
Hundreds of armed guards were sent in.

453
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,321
To locals, they were an occupying army.

454
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,778
Despite the worries about sabotage,

455
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,366
communities that lay
in the potential flood path

456
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:27,059
were never consulted about the dam.

457
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:30,994
The Santa Clara River Valley
stretched 50 miles

458
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:34,618
from the San Francisquito
Canyon to the Pacific Ocean,

459
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,725
a patchwork of citrus farms and oil wells

460
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,867
that was a magnet for
newcomers seeking work.

461
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,766
There were some groups
that had been there for generations,

462
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:48,045
back from the Spanish era

463
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,841
and the Mexican period of the 19th century.

464
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:54,086
But many were starting to arrive, really,

465
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,467
in the early 1900s,

466
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,366
and especially during
the Mexican Revolution,

467
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,024
like my grandfather.

468
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:04,441
Half the people
in Santa Paula were of Mexican descent,

469
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:09,411
most of them recent arrivals
working in the citrus industry.

470
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:12,035
My great-aunt and her husband

471
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,485
were hardworking people.

472
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,832
Poor.

473
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,592
So they had to follow the crops.

474
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:22,355
Soledad, being the oldest child,

475
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,808
stayed behind in camp
taking care of her siblings.

476
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:33,263
When they would come home,
they lived in Santa Paula.

477
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,748
And it was very close to the river bottom.

478
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:38,509
Not a lot of people knew

479
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,511
of the St. Francis Dam.

480
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,825
Even the ranchers who owned
a lot of the orchards,

481
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,931
they didn't even know
the dam was being built

482
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:48,623
until the cement was being poured.

483
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:51,764
You can imagine that the
Mexican community had no idea.

484
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,803
That's what's so weird.

485
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:58,322
I mean, it's this major structure.

486
00:28:58,357 --> 00:29:01,256
And it's just fascinating
that there's so many people

487
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,190
who don't really have any
sense that it's there.

488
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:12,371
Mulholland gets a call,

489
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:14,614
I think it was a Monday,

490
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:19,240
from Tony Harnischfeger,
who's his dam keeper.

491
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:23,451
Harnischfeger was
highly attuned to the dam's condition.

492
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,902
He and his family lived in the shadow

493
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:28,042
of the enormous structure.

494
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:31,804
Over the last year,
Harnischfeger had watched

495
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,153
as a series of cracks appeared in the dam.

496
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,397
Those cracks went
all the way through the dam.

497
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:39,916
There were at least four of them.

498
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,022
And Mulholland plugged all of the cracks

499
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,784
with oakum on the downstream face.

500
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,234
That was the absolute
worst thing you could do,

501
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:51,203
because now you're taking that
hydraulic pressure

502
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,171
and you're putting it on
the interior of the dam.

503
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:57,450
Harnischfeger was on edge.

504
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:00,074
The reservoir had been filled to capacity

505
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:02,801
for the first time five days before.

506
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:06,977
Water was leaking under
the dam's west side.

507
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:09,117
Mulholland goes out there

508
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,292
right away to take a look at it.

509
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:13,777
And what he told
Harnischfeger was, you know,

510
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,917
"There's no active erosion

511
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:18,782
"occurring of the dam foundation.

512
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,372
This is a lot about nothing."

513
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,477
Mulholland was back at the office

514
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,755
in time for a late lunch.

515
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,068
But with every passing minute,

516
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:31,864
the internal stresses on
the dam were multiplying.

517
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:34,556
At around 11:20 p.m.,

518
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,629
the structure finally began to give way.

519
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:42,495
A huge crack opened up
on its upstream side.

520
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,877
This is where that extra height

521
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:47,638
really makes a difference.

522
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:49,468
It's kind of like, you know,

523
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:52,471
straws on a camel's back.

524
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,957
This dam did not have the capacity

525
00:30:55,992 --> 00:31:00,997
to stop the loads
that were being put on it.

526
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:06,174
The dam was actually tilting
one half of a degree.

527
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:09,729
Already the St.
Francis Dam was fractured by cracks,

528
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:13,147
and its central section
was tilting forward.

529
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,804
Then another defect

530
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,118
in Mulholland's design came into play.

531
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,983
What about water that seeps under the base

532
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:25,918
of the dam and then begins
to push up at the bottom,

533
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:30,233
what was termed uplift?

534
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,821
The dam had sort of pushed
up off of its foundation.

535
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:35,963
Like most modern dams,

536
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:39,725
the St. Francis included
relief wells to prevent uplift,

537
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,487
but only in its center section.

538
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:47,906
The wings of the dam were
beginning to slip away.

539
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,393
Around 11:30 p.m.,
a massive chunk of the dam,

540
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:58,226
severed by cracks and weakened
by uplift, blew out.

541
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:00,746
Intensely pressurized water began

542
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,782
jetting through the resulting gap.

543
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:07,201
The entire east wing was
on the verge of collapse.

544
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,413
Over time, water
from the reservoir had begun

545
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,553
to saturate the east abutment,

546
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:17,383
which was made up
of this geological formation

547
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:19,765
called schist,

548
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,975
and it's layers of slate
literally stacked on each other.

549
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:28,049
If it begins to be on an angle,
as the hillside was,

550
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:33,192
and water gets in between
these slate-like layers,

551
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,712
it slides like a deck of cards.

552
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,097
At two-and-a-half minutes before midnight,

553
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:44,203
the entire hillside under the east wing

554
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,102
collapsed into the dam.

555
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,110
The dam was sliding on its base.

556
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:58,183
And the west side crumbled down.

557
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,840
And it collapses.

558
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:07,951
Tony Harnischfeger probably saw it happen.

559
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,265
Ace Hopewell, smoking a cigarette

560
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:15,096
a mile up the road,
heard it in the distance.

561
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:18,686
The landslide severed the wires

562
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,758
carrying power to Los Angeles.

563
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:25,279
The lights in the city flickered.

564
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:30,698
This huge flow,

565
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:33,356
close to a million cubic feet per second,

566
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,531
just rushes down the canyon.

567
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:40,018
For Harnischfeger and his family,

568
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,779
"Oh, my God!"

569
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:46,058
There's no way you're going
to withstand that.

570
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,582
The sound of the collapsing dam

571
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,205
took a little less
than seven seconds to reach

572
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,070
the cluster of cabins around
Powerhouse Number 2,

573
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,969
where it woke Lillian Curtis.

574
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,764
She looked out to see

575
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,700
"a misty haze hanging
over everything."

576
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:10,393
Suddenly, Curtis grabbed her
husband and screamed,

577
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:13,327
"The dam has broke!"

578
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:18,401
It's a colossal
force coming down the canyon,

579
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:22,819
not like anything your senses
would ever have understood.

580
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:26,167
Curtis scrambled up the side of the canyon

581
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:28,928
with her three-year-old son,
while her husband

582
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,828
went back to fetch the girls.

583
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,837
That people had enough time

584
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,391
to try to save their families

585
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,945
and then to fail is,

586
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,845
is a horrifying idea.

587
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,471
40 minutes after the collapse,

588
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:57,509
the deluge burst out of
the canyon and turned into

589
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,683
the valley of the Santa Clara River,

590
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:02,238
where 140 Edison Company workers

591
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,688
were sleeping at an encampment.

592
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,038
"The confusion," one man remembered,

593
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:12,938
"was indescribable."

594
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:17,598
Fewer than half of them
would see the sun rise.

595
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,361
Most of the people who were killed

596
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:24,777
probably never knew what
was happening to them.

597
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:26,434
They just knew they were drowning.

598
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:30,162
In Santa Paula, ten-year-old

599
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,545
Soledad Luna heard shouting outside.

600
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:39,137
Two motorcycle policemen were going around

601
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,760
yelling, "Agua, agua!"

602
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:44,694
My great-grandfather thought it was crazy.

603
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,179
"It hasn't been raining...
what water is he talking about?"

604
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:51,563
So my family didn't really
pay much attention

605
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:55,360
until other neighbors started running.

606
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:58,017
Precious minutes ticked by

607
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:00,986
as Soledad's father
and her Uncle Sisto packed

608
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,540
the family's possessions before finally

609
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:06,060
gathering her young cousins.

610
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:08,821
Sisto got his children,

611
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:12,515
put the four oldest
in the flatbed of the truck,

612
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:15,863
and his wife was sitting
in the cab of the truck

613
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:20,247
holding their infant when the water hit.

614
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:24,216
As the truck toppled over,
they could see the little

615
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,839
children's arms flailing in the water,

616
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,463
trying to grasp, and crying out.

617
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:33,087
With nowhere to go,

618
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,676
Soledad's mother grabbed her four children

619
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,541
and huddled them on the bed.

620
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:42,614
The first impact tore
their flimsy house apart.

621
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,998
Miraculously, Soledad, her mother,

622
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,518
and her three siblings were carried away

623
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:55,385
on the crest of the flood,
their bed a life raft.

624
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,664
But Soledad's luck seemed
to run out when her hair

625
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:03,151
became entangled in the branches of a tree.

626
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,464
Soledad watched her mother and siblings

627
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:08,467
float away into the darkness.

628
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:10,642
Soledad screamed,

629
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:13,507
and her mother tried
to grab her and couldn't.

630
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,543
She couldn't see.

631
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,442
It was, it was dark.

632
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:20,307
But she could hear animals drowning,

633
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:24,172
people screaming.

634
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:28,211
And that was so terrifying to her.

635
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,456
As the flood carried
Soledad's mother downstream,

636
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,423
it spread across the landscape until

637
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,392
the leading edge was almost two miles wide.

638
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:42,052
Even so, it still had power enough

639
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:46,160
to demolish railroad and highway bridges.

640
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,266
Along the way, it had
picked up all the debris

641
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,303
of the economy of the
Santa Clara River Valley.

642
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,757
Orchard trees, cattle.

643
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,691
And as you get to the ocean,

644
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:02,556
oil from oil drilling.

645
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,077
So it's this mix of sludge

646
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:10,080
and rocks and parts of steel bridges

647
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:14,740
and bodies and animals
in a kind of an oil slick.

648
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:20,850
At 5:25 in the morning,

649
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,059
at the mouth of the Santa Clara River,

650
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,925
the floodwaters finally
washed into the sea.

651
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,361
The next day was gloomy,

652
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:52,019
overcast.

653
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:56,264
There was no color at all that morning.

654
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,991
My grandfather walked around.

655
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:02,719
He remembered houses
just broken into pieces.

656
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:08,346
Trees uprooted and thrown everywhere.

657
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:15,180
Cadavers lined up like piles of wood.

658
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:19,322
Mothers crying, in tears, sobbing.

659
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:26,571
There were bodies strewn everywhere.

660
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:29,125
Boy Scouts would go out with little flags,

661
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,403
and when they found a body,

662
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:34,337
they would put the flag in the ground,

663
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,858
and then a recovery crew
would come and pick up

664
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,343
and carry the body away on stretchers,

665
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,001
put them on the back of trucks,
and take them into town.

666
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:49,145
Rescuers found Lillian Curtis,

667
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,768
her son, and a neighbor on a hillside

668
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:55,013
overlooking the ruins of Powerhouse 2.

669
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:58,430
Everyone else in the town was dead.

670
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:05,230
They found my Great-Aunt Irene

671
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:09,234
where the mouth of the river
empties into the Pacific Ocean.

672
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:12,996
She was cold and wet,

673
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:17,380
scared, not able to speak the language.

674
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:31,394
Soledad was found many,

675
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,466
many, many hours
later hanging from the tree.

676
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:42,129
It traumatized her so much that
to the very day that she passed,

677
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:45,891
she could still remember
the man's name that found her.

678
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,722
It was a Mr. Baxter.

679
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:56,005
Mulholland
doesn't get there until hours later.

680
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,491
He stands in shock and awe

681
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:02,045
and horror,

682
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,393
looking at where the
St. Francis Dam once was.

683
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:12,055
And all that's left is this
center section of the dam.

684
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,921
Everything else from the dam is gone.

685
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:26,173
Within days,

686
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:29,487
tourists began showing up
at the disaster zone.

687
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,975
Scaling the towering monolith
that became known as

688
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:38,288
the Tombstone.

689
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:41,706
Collecting bits of debris for souvenirs.

690
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,678
The sightseers fed a growing
bitterness among the survivors.

691
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:55,029
The haves and have-nots
are very finely delineated

692
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:58,412
during times of distress,
during times of disaster.

693
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:01,104
It makes the inequalities
in a society very acute.

694
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:08,008
Searchers found
bodies of ranchers, housewives,

695
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:13,116
teachers, farmhands, children.

696
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:17,535
But some of the bodies were lost forever.

697
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,640
We never know how many,

698
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:23,230
exactly, died that night.

699
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:28,131
It was a community that
had many transients.

700
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:33,620
There were migrant workers
or migrant families.

701
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:36,554
And so many of them, maybe,
who lived along the river,

702
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:39,349
who got swept away,

703
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:43,561
they will never be known.

704
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:45,804
And the fact that we can never name them

705
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,910
or find out who they are

706
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:50,913
still haunts us even to this day.

707
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:03,477
For supporters of Hoover Dam,

708
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:06,929
the disaster couldn't
have come at a worse time.

709
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:10,070
Just as the Senate was about to decide

710
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:13,107
the fate of the project,
Mulholland's catastrophe

711
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:16,594
threatened to bring
down the whole enterprise.

712
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:20,598
The Hoover Dam was the largest line-item

713
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:24,394
expenditure in the history
of the United States.

714
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:27,984
They had the votes to
finally get this thing.

715
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:29,631
The problem was that
Mulholland was the biggest

716
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:34,715
visible cheerleader
for that whole proposal.

717
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,408
How can you be sure about
the safety of any other dam?

718
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:44,311
They've got to find a way
to deal with this very quickly.

719
00:43:46,175 --> 00:43:49,799
On March 15, two days after the disaster,

720
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,353
California Governor C.C. Young

721
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:56,219
appointed a commission to
investigate the dam's failure.

722
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:59,947
Within a week, the commission
announced that the dam

723
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:02,191
had collapsed because of a deficiency

724
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,642
in the soil under the west wing.

725
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:07,230
It was a reassuring conclusion:

726
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:09,888
the failure was an aberration,

727
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:12,995
unlikely to be repeated.

728
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:14,790
It's a rabbit trail.

729
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:17,206
It's not what caused the dam to fail.

730
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,350
But nobody wants to
investigate it too much.

731
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:26,180
Meanwhile, the city moved quickly

732
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:29,080
to settle with the survivors.

733
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:32,255
The city agreed
upon a kind of a fixed price.

734
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,845
$5,000 for a human life is not enough.

735
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,227
But that's what was negotiated.

736
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:41,368
The city paid, very quickly.

737
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:44,233
They wanted to get it out of the way.

738
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:50,549
But for Mulholland,
the reckoning was just beginning.

739
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:54,139
Some of the victims had
died in Los Angeles County,

740
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:56,452
so the county coroner
had to determine whether

741
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,937
a crime had been committed.

742
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,525
It's not a criminal trial.

743
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,907
It was a trial to determine
who was responsible

744
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:05,530
and to determine if they were
going to indict anybody.

745
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,912
It's quite possible that William Mulholland

746
00:45:07,946 --> 00:45:10,397
would've been indicted for murder.

747
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:16,092
Eight days after the disaster,

748
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:17,991
William Mulholland took the stand

749
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:21,788
at the Los Angeles County Courthouse.

750
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:26,102
To date, 277 bodies had been found.

751
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:29,588
Hundreds were still missing.

752
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:33,385
Mulholland was at times prickly and evasive

753
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,664
under interrogation, but he did, finally,

754
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,253
get to the heart of the matter.

755
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:42,325
"If there is any error in human judgment,"

756
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,156
Mulholland admitted, "I was the human.

757
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,331
I won't try to fasten
it on anybody else."

758
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,509
The fact that Mulholland takes

759
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:57,306
responsibility for the
St. Francis Dam disaster

760
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,449
allows people not to have to
ask really difficult questions.

761
00:46:02,483 --> 00:46:04,762
If blame could be put on this individual,

762
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,729
you just remove the individual.

763
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:12,459
In November 1928, a few weeks before

764
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:15,255
the crucial Senate vote on Hoover Dam,

765
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:19,259
William Mulholland retired
from the Water Bureau.

766
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,330
It was time for him to move along.

767
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:23,677
And so long as he did, then he was,

768
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:25,437
well, he was given a pension.

769
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:28,716
They hold a banquet for him.

770
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:33,031
No mention is ever made
of the St. Francis Dam.

771
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:40,211
In the spring of
1929, the City of Los Angeles

772
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:42,972
erased one of the last
vestiges of the disaster

773
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:46,907
by obliterating the dam's remains.

774
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:55,916
But it wasn't so easy
to get rid of the very

775
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,470
conspicuous reminder
of the St. Francis Dam,

776
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:03,441
and of William Mulholland,
in the heart of Los Angeles.

777
00:47:03,475 --> 00:47:05,926
Nobody trusted the Hollywood Dam

778
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:09,861
after St. Francis Dam went out.

779
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:13,969
They ended up drawing it down two-thirds.

780
00:47:14,003 --> 00:47:17,110
It only holds one-third its
design capacity,

781
00:47:17,144 --> 00:47:20,251
and it had a huge embankment fill

782
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:23,116
added to the front of it.

783
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,083
The monument to

784
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:28,293
the triumph of man over nature
and to William Mulholland

785
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,157
gets buried in dirt.

786
00:47:30,192 --> 00:47:34,334
People in Hollywood no
longer have to be reminded

787
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:38,269
that there is a huge dam
looming over their heads.

788
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:41,375
Mulholland had a stroke

789
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,413
and his health began to deteriorate.

790
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,519
At family gathering, he would just

791
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:50,522
sit in the corner
and just stare into space.

792
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,183
William Mulholland died in Los Angeles

793
00:47:56,218 --> 00:47:59,324
on July 22, 1935,

794
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,328
two months before the
dedication of Hoover Dam.

795
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:10,439
Heroes serve the
purpose of simplifying stories.

796
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:13,407
Villains also do something similar.

797
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:19,413
And in this story,
Mulholland is the villain.

798
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:20,922
There's lots of other folks, including

799
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:22,682
the populace of Los Angeles,
who voted for the project,

800
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,039
who overwhelmingly supported it.

801
00:48:26,248 --> 00:48:29,320
This is a communal effort.

802
00:48:39,192 --> 00:48:41,953
The St. Francis
Dam had largely disappeared

803
00:48:41,988 --> 00:48:44,507
from popular memory,

804
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:47,648
but it left a deep impression
among the engineers

805
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:51,790
who were designing the next
generation of public works.

806
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,103
The Hoover Dam

807
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:56,243
was to be the cornerstone of a new West,

808
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:58,245
and its creators were

809
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,215
determined to banish
the ghost of St. Francis.

810
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:05,735
I think a lot of good
things come out of failures.

811
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,393
We pull back,

812
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:11,465
we do things more carefully.

813
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,642
St. Francis Dam had a
huge impact on Hoover Dam.

814
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:18,610
Where the St.
Francis Dam had been largely

815
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:21,303
one man's creation, sketched out and then

816
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:25,065
altered on the fly,
Hoover Dam was scrutinized

817
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,999
by teams of experts at every stage

818
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,519
of its design and construction.

819
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:33,556
It captured the imagination

820
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:36,283
as few public works ever have.

821
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,357
Immense dams became
defining monuments of the age.

822
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:56,027
The legacy of
the St. Francis Dam disaster

823
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:59,479
was a very short-term moral,

824
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:02,551
which is, "Build your
dams more carefully."

825
00:50:02,585 --> 00:50:06,072
I wish that they had taken

826
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:09,006
a bigger moral from the story,

827
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,528
which is, "Never trust anyone

828
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:17,497
who tells you that
you can have it all."

829
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:20,086
When they said, "Yeah,

830
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,711
"even though it doesn't rain,
the sun is always shining,

831
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:28,370
"we can feed the growing
city of L.A.

832
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:31,683
and water our crops,"

833
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:34,203
all of them thought that
they could have it all.

834
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:39,070
The idea that moving
water from one geography

835
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:41,210
to another can be done
to such great effect,

836
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:44,696
to say that's a disaster
might be counterintuitive.

837
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:47,423
But in some ways,

838
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,530
that allowed other regions
to do the same thing.

839
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:55,604
It got us in the situation we're in today.

840
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:59,021
We can look at Mulholland Dam,
or St. Francis Dam,

841
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,817
or Hoover Dam, and we can think of those

842
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,474
as engineering marvels.

843
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:05,993
But also, all of these things

844
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:08,306
have led us to an unsustainable future.

845
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:11,896
People are so optimistic
that technology will solve

846
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,795
these environmental problems

847
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,487
that sometimes we lose sight

848
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:20,525
of other ways to solve problems.

849
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,494
We're going to have to
learn to manage our resources,

850
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:25,806
most particularly water.

851
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:29,016
Where are we going to get it from?

852
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,260
What are we going to do with it?

853
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:34,194
This story, and as little known as it is,

854
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:36,921
is a warning.

855
00:51:36,955 --> 00:51:40,338
And it couldn't be more relevant to today.

855
00:51:41,305 --> 00:52:41,836
