FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:35,407
THE YOO'S FRUIT SHOP

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,262
Iâ¦

5
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,550
I remember.

6
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,678
You'll know how flustered

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,218
I am by your actions

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,440
once you get your memories back.

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,476
I'm sure she wanted

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,694
to slap my shameless face.

11
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,607
It's amazingâ¦

12
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,907
that she held back all her life.

13
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,164
I felt like my life was already over

14
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,375
when I was 22.

15
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,585
I prayed to God

16
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,048
to give me a reason to live.

17
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,465
And right then,

18
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,853
she appeared in front of me like fate.

19
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:00,999
I promise I'll work harder
and move to a better place.

20
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,382
Guys, Dad's home.

21
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,300
Dad, did you drive safely today?

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,629
I sure did.

23
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,093
-Welcome home.
-Where's your mother?

24
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,224
-Bedroom.
-Bedroom.

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,510
The bedroom?

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,270
You're home.

27
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,654
Ms. Sook, did you cry?

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,782
No.

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,740
Did the kids give you a hard time?

30
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,315
Actuallyâ¦

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,370
I was reading andâ¦

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,830
You cried while reading? Like a kid?

33
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,207
You made fun of me
when I cried during a movie.

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,087
The kids are home.

35
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,842
I wanted her to be happy as I was

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,059
and love me as much as I loved her.

37
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,729
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,597
Eun-hee.

39
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,697
What did I do wrong

40
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,819
to make her leave?

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,488
I promised that if she came back,

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,631
I would only live
as the father of our children.

43
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,084
He said this was
the day he proposed to you

44
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,449
{\an8}and held your hand for the first time,

45
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,831
{\an8}and this photo was taken
to remember it forever.

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
{\an8}Mom.

47
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,676
{\an8}Dad said it wrong,

48
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,849
{\an8}right?

49
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,851
{\an8}You said you already

50
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,234
{\an8}had Eun-joo at the time.

51
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,479
She cannot be premature.

52
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,482
Eun-joo was born later than her due date.

53
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,446
Did youâ¦

54
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,195
say it wrong?

55
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,848
I have no idea

56
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,149
what you're talking about.

57
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,815
Your father's memories

58
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,818
are not all there yet.

59
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,532
Want to take some jangjorim?

60
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,997
You like to have my stir-fried anchovies
and jangjorim with beer.

61
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,944
Mom.

62
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,279
I've always been curiousâ¦

63
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,244
Why did you

64
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,485
leave the house with only Eun-joo?

65
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,208
Why didn't you take me with you?

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,210
At that timeâ¦

67
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,089
I was younger than your current age.

68
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,973
I didn't know

69
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,136
what I had to doâ¦

70
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,061
Mom.

71
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,179
That's not what I'm asking you.

72
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,305
Since then,

73
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,404
I thought you'd leave again,

74
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,901
so I started walking
on eggshells around you,

75
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,817
so you would take me with you next time.

76
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,581
I want to know if there was another reason

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,620
other than you hating me.

78
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,995
I feel bad

79
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,047
for being mean to Eun-joo all my life.

80
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,184
Yes.

81
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,270
After I returned,

82
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,648
I realized that I broke your heart.

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,315
You used to laugh a lot

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,620
and remain confident even
when you were in trouble,

85
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,753
but you started walking on eggshells

86
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,210
and looked around

87
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,469
to see where I amâ¦

88
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,011
It's my fault.

89
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,821
I remembered what Dad said

90
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,529
at Eun-joo's wedding.

91
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,223
What's wrong with you?

92
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,008
Why do you keep making that angry face?

93
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,678
I'm not angry.

94
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,349
Is it because I'm not graceful
as his family?

95
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,647
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,574
I'm sorry I don't fit as Eun-joo's father.

97
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,111
Iâ¦

98
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,080
I now understand

99
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,332
what Dad was talking about.

100
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,630
Noâ¦

101
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,046
Noâ¦

102
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,511
Noâ¦

103
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,137
Your father and I were going to

104
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,427
keep it to ourselves, andâ¦

105
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,442
Noâ¦

106
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,473
Yes.

107
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,847
All secrets are revealed eventually.

108
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,771
Who knew that your father
would become 22 years old againâ¦

109
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,023
and bring that up.

110
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,202
Take that photo to him.

111
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,954
I'm sick of your father being immature.

112
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,704
It's not his fault.

113
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,905
I figured it out.

114
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,961
Should I just act like
I don't know about it?

115
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,540
Eun-joo is still my sister.
That doesnât change.

116
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,746
Nothing has to change.

117
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,877
No matter how things go,
your father is your sister's real father.

118
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,507
We have to admit that.

119
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,563
If he wasn't, I wouldn't have been
with him until now.

120
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,725
Eun-joo has to know the truth.

121
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,613
Don't let her hear it
from someone else, Mom.

122
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,659
You mustâ¦

123
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,907
tell her.

124
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,746
Youâ¦

125
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,589
I'm home.

126
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,302
What is it this time?

127
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,795
Are you two fighting?

128
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,505
We need to get along, please.

129
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,318
Gosh, such a mess!

130
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,450
Youâ¦

131
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,745
Did you hear the conversation just now?

132
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,672
No.

133
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,578
What conversation?

134
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,968
Youâ¦

135
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,934
-Don't you have anything to say to me?
-I don't.

136
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,387
Sit.

137
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,156
Since you confessed your feelings for me,

138
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,247
I must answer it.

139
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,430
I got estranged from my parents
when I got into medical school,

140
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,930
and I don't have any friends
to share my secrets with.

141
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,932
You were my only family and friend.

142
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,055
I mean this.

143
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,937
I am going to start working
at the clinic tomorrow.

144
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,276
Take as much time as you need.

145
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,609
Start over.

146
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,532
Meet a man too.

147
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,094
I wanted to talk about it lightly today.

148
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,170
You need a child, a husband, and love.

149
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,553
That's what a true family is.

150
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,218
But that won't be possible with me.

151
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,313
You don't need to be
so meticulous and plan my future.

152
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,806
I can take care of my matters.

153
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,571
I tried to be your friend,
but it's not working.

154
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,374
I can't forgive you easily, either.

155
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,865
Butâ¦

156
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,374
If I just forget about it,

157
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,127
it doesn't seem that serious.

158
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,745
Because I know everything now.

159
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,259
There's no need to be anxious
about not knowing the reason.

160
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,931
Wait until I figure out what I want.

161
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,813
You've been making decisions

162
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,350
all by yourself until now.

163
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,729
Don't rush me.

164
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,556
That's the fair way to do it.

165
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,769
Yes.

166
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,066
Do as you wish.

167
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,219
The CEO is going to
reschedule the meeting.

168
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,891
Vice CEO went on vacation.

169
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,431
He came a long time ago,
and he goes on vacation now?

170
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:39,437
Are they going to get married
and start a family?

171
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,339
Chan-hyuk. Eun-hee found out about it.

172
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,507
About what?

173
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,635
About Eun-joo.

174
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,059
I don't know how,

175
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,640
but I heard her talking about
Eun-joo with Mom.

176
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,938
What did she say to you?

177
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,479
She doesn't know that I know.

178
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,243
Are you sure Eun-hee
doesn't know that you know?

179
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,368
I'm sure she doesn't.

180
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,617
I'm 100% sure she'll ask me.

181
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,503
What should I say?

182
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,669
Let's just be honest
and tell her that we know.

183
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,957
By the wayâ¦

184
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,712
I told her not to call you.
Do you think she will?

185
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,627
Why?

186
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,759
It seemed wrong for her
to come to the office

187
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,215
when you were ignoring her calls.

188
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,555
She's dating someone
so I said to keep a distance.

189
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,311
Does Eun-hee have to keep a distance
from me if she's dating someone?

190
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,444
And why should Eun-hee hear
such a thing from her younger brother?

191
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,282
Is it because you work at my company
and you might feel uncomfortable?

192
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
You're not thinking straight.

193
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,453
That's purely between me and Eun-hee.

194
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,820
It's not your business.

195
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,788
Are you being punished?
Hurry up and follow me.

196
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,293
Leave him be.

197
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,924
He's been staying up all night
almost every day recently.

198
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,629
I know.

199
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,802
Why does he get so many messages?

200
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,387
He's Mr. Popular in the matchmaking world.

201
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,437
What does that mean?

202
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,402
Calling back to a message
means you're old.

203
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,855
Hello, this is Golden Goose Media.

204
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,906
Can I check the Director's schedule
for today, please?

205
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,196
Would it be possible to
pull the appointment forward?

206
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,245
A meeting with a publishing company?

207
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,250
I see.

208
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,168
Okay.

209
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,015
HIRING A BARISTA

210
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,450
I think the owner
stepped out for a moment.

211
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,196
Do you want the usual?

212
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,330
I'll take it to go.

213
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,956
Okay.

214
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,324
I'm quitting my job here soon.

215
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,908
Are you taking it to go because of me?

216
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,922
I'll get out of your sight soon,
so don't worry.

217
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,601
{\an8}1 P.M., P&F BOOKS
4 P.M., GOLDEN GOOSE MEDIA

218

JULY 15, 2:06 P.M.

219
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,874
MEDITATION CENTER

220
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,713
-Hi, Chan-pal.
-Hi.

221
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,290
-A meeting with the Director?
-Yes.

222
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,420
You're scheduled for 4 p.m.

223
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,962
Yes, that's right.

224
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,876
I'm too early.

225
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,005
What should I do by myself?

226
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,393
Can you kill time with me?

227
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,679
Yes.

228
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,560
Let's go.

229
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,990
Did you run here?

230
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,398
No, I was just out thereâ¦

231
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,663
Actuallyâ¦

232
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,121
I tried to call you a few times last week.

233
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,871
In the middle of the night.

234
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,293
Then why didn't you call me?

235
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,593
Because I said we shouldn't
be in contact for a while?

236
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,801
It's not like I have to listen to you.

237
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,341
Then why didn't you call?

238
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,183
Well, just becauseâ¦

239
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,217
Is Ji-woo working hard?

240
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,390
Yes.

241
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,233
Ji-woo said you're family to him.

242
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,532
Me too.

243
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,899
Ji-woo used to lie often
when he was young.

244
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,243
I couldn't take it anymore,
so I hypnotized him.

245
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,334
I told him that lying is very bad,

246
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,949
but it's okay if he shakes
his leg while lying.

247
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,657
That he won't be punished.

248
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,707
Shake your leg every time you lie.

249
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,382
Shake your legâ¦

250
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,761
You're more like a gangster than a sister.

251
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,168
Chan-hyuk.

252
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,724
You told me

253
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,354
Ji-woo was troubled
about something, right?

254
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,428
Ji-woo told you, didn't he?

255
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,385
You know what it is, right?

256
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,105
What a big coward.

257
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,115
What's with that face, when you know it?

258
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,122
Yes.

259
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,871
Ji-woo knowsâ¦

260
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,365
and I know, because Ji-woo
asked me for counseling.

261
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,924
I'm not a private safe. I'm a family safe.

262
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,301
How did he find it out?
He's not even that keen.

263
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,302
He heard it
when your father was at the hospital.

264
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,345
Still, you're always quicker
than me for everything.

265
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,600
You really must be a brother to him.

266
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,596
That was when you just made up
with Eun-joo.

267
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,648
Ji-woo will never tell.

268
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,763
-Mom.
-Eun-joo, let's go.

269
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,095
Let's go, hurry.

270
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,189
Are you looking for anywhere specific?

271
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,768
That cafe from earlier had a great vibe.

272
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,774
Some places changed,
and some places are still the same.

273
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,937
I don't know.

274
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,735
You said you have something to say.

275
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,568
Where are you going? We can justâ¦

276
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,872
I am going to tell you about the past.

277
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,118
I was wondering
where I should tell to you,

278
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,661
and then, I recalled the neighborhood
I lived in when I was young.

279
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,167
This is the first time
you're telling me this.

280
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,132
It must be around here.

281
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,472
In our yard,

282
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,064
we had a few persimmon trees.

283
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,147
In autumn, the persimmon trees bent,

284
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,363
and came down to the alley.

285
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,735
Your grandmother watched it
with a broomstick in her hand.

286
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,990
Whenever a hungry child

287
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,909
tried to steal a persimmon

288
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,619
she hit the child with the broomstick.

289
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,714
My mom was soâ¦

290
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,422
harsh and greedy.

291
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,762
I hated that.

292
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,928
Whenever you said

293
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,305
I'm cold

294
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,016
and harsh

295
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,556
I recalled my mom.

296
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,484
I only said it once or twiceâ¦

297
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,863
I said it when I was furious. Why do youâ¦

298
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,657
I get told I'm cold and harsh
way more often.

299
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,918
Mom.

300
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:39,095
I've never seen you like this.
I'm worried.

301
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,270
What is it?

302
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,347
What is it you want to say?

303
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,305
It's okay.

304
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,103
Tell me everything.

305
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,904
Let's go.

306
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,815
I've always been

307
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,906
on Mom's side all the time,

308
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,157
but right now, I hate her a bit.

309
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,342
"Were Dad and I just a joke to Mom?"

310
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,756
I get ridiculous thoughts like that.

311
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,800
So?

312
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,182
Will you always be
on your father's side now?

313
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,513
I'm not going to take sides anymore.

314
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,596
I'm just going to be on my side.

315
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,144
What use is a family at this age?

316
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,898
Iâ¦

317
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,738
I heard about the Director's
appointment with you,

318
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,123
so I came here early on purpose.

319
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,788
So I could run into you

320
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,290
like a coincidence.

321
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,011
What's with those eyes?

322
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,675
What?

323
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,642
I think I overreacted last time.

324
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,226
We're friends and when I said we shouldn't
contact each other for a whileâ¦

325
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,571
It seems too childish.

326
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,859
I heard the news from Ji-woo.
I got worried about you and Eun-joo,

327
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,649
so I rushed over here.

328
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,369
You look kind of

329
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,914
disappointed.

330
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,589
Kind of? Do you think it's "kind of?"
I'm totally disappointed.

331
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,841
My heart totally fluttered when you said

332
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,465
you came early to see me.

333
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,891
I thought of dating you from today.

334
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,233
Happy now? Is that what
you wanted to hear?

335
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,815
Oh.

336
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,517
I have something to tell you

337
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,345
about your father.

338
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,900
I don't know how things are now,

339
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,065
but at the time,

340
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,281
when an unmarried female
college student got pregnant,

341
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,155
it brought shame to the family.

342
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,997
The whole family was in chaos,

343
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,836
and the older brothers were even angrier.

344
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,176
They told me to abort you

345
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,310
and go into a Buddhist temple

346
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,563
and hide there forever.

347
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,490
It was my life,

348
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,526
and it was my baby.

349
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,213
Iâ¦

350
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,093
I chose you.

351
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,784
At the time,

352
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,201
an unmarried female student
who got pregnant

353
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
had nowhere to go.

354
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,422
The 22-year-old female student
who wanted to protect her baby,

355
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,089
though she was ignored
by her family and the father of the baby,

356
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:08,473
she became a family
with a 22-year-old man in love

357
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,061
who'd been watching her for a long time.

358
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,657
Eun-joo.

359
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,907
Say something.

360
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,782
What can I say?

361
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,365
I never imagined I'd hear such a story.

362
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,123
I tried to cover it up forever.

363
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,838
If your father didn't have an accident,
I would've done thatâ¦

364
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,674
I'm not a kid or a teenager
going through puberty.

365
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,676
I guess it's a good thing to hear it now.

366
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,887
Age doesn't matter with things like this.

367
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,142
Do I have to

368
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,190
ask about my biological father and so on?

369
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,324
No, you donât need to.

370
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,913
I never even thought about him, either.

371
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,870
Why?

372
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,407
That's a bit sad.

373
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,958
Did you love him at least?

374
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,762
Was I born

375
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,549
ruining your life?

376
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,974
No, that's not true.

377
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,519
Iâ¦

378
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
I loved you.

379
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,400
I never regretted giving birth to you.

380
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,884
Thank you

381
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,184
for not giving up on me, Mom.

382
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,802
Iâ¦

383
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,721
I told Mom to tell her directly.

384
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,510
So I haven't called my mom

385
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,515
and my sister for a week.

386
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,851
Me,

387
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,685
my family,

388
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,480
and that family

389
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,862
are all being too cruel

390
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,993
to Kim Eun-joo, don't you think?

391
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,826
Iâ¦

392
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,168
learned something from you.

393
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,633
Though I always see my family
and know them so well,

394
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,512
I still have to put effort.

395
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,426
You try your best for your family.

396
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,561
That's what I liked about you.

397
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,767
You try your best for others too.

398
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:35,936
And Jong-pal and my twenties grew
and developed thanks to your nosiness.

399
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,235
I mean it.

400
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,238
You're a decent person.

401
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,575
You don't need to
blame yourself for everything.

402
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,548
-Get going.
-Okay, bye.

403
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,489
So you had to give upâ¦

404
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,924
on a lot of things
in your life because of me.

405
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,092
I never gave up on anything.

406
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,932
Do you know how happyâ¦

407
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,764
I was in that small room because of you?

408
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,061
Your father

409
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,887
loved you so much.

410
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,805
He even drove all night home

411
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,817
just to see you for a moment.

412
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,611
That was all real.

413
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,199
Was I actually lovely?

414
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,456
I'm not really sure.

415
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,291
You were.

416
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,633
If it wasn't for that,

417
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,548
I wouldn't have been
with your father until now.

418
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,054
He's not my father.

419
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,056
"Your biological father." "Your father."

420
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,233
I'm just a bit confused.

421
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,241
You must be tired.

422
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,491
You should go home and rest.

423
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,236
Give me some time to think.

424
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,907
I'll get going first.

425
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,568
My dearest Geon-hee.

426
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,985
You look lovely.

427
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,373
Where's Uncle?

428
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,076
Now, here.

429
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,581
-It's okay.
-No.

430
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,583
The baby is tired.

431
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,835
Geon-hee, you grabbed so many items.

432
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,919
Isnât this a scam?

433
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,003
Why grab everything?

434
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,168
I thought babies were
supposed to grab just one.

435
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,387
In the future, storytelling will be
more important in the world.

436
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,929
If he becomes a baseball player,

437
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,142
then he can say he grabbed a baseball.

438
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,273
If he becomes an idol,
he grabbed a microphone.

439
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,770
We should be able to prove it.

440
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,522
Natural-born talent is important.

441
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,523
Whatever. Where's Shin Saimdang?

442
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,726
Money is the most important,
but itâs not here.

443
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,897
You're a snob.

444
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,987
You're such a snob.

445
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,200
In this story,

446
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,530
I'll be the money-crazy one.
Because it's my profession.

447
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,616
But I'll do it later.
Geon-hee is very tired.

448
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,292
Let's take a break.

449
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,500
Okay.

450
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,960
-Let's shoot the source.
-Okay.

451
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,129
Let's take a break
and do it one more time.

452
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,168
-Okay.
-Sure.

453
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,052
-Let's go mainly with colors.
-Okay.

454
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,220
Hey, Park Chan-hyuk.

455
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,758
I heard you saw Eun-hee.

456
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,636
Yes.

457
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,226
I feel so refreshed
because you two met up.

458
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,773
Those wretched lunatics.

459
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,526
I told her to come,
but Eun-hee was acting so busy.

460
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,110
Hey, remember
the girlfriend's letter contest

461
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,026
when you were in the army?

462
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,034
Eun-hee acted like your girlfriend
and wrote an erotic letter.

463
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,697
It wasn't erotic.

464
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,195
It was erotic.

465
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:43,577
"Whenever you take a photo,
your chin is soâ¦"

466
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,457
"Your fingers touching the camera are soâ¦"

467
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,625
Stop that.

468
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,763
Why did this Item Grabbing
turn into an alumni reunion?

469
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,591
That erotic letter unanimously
won the grand prize,

470
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,177
and he got five days of stand-down.

471
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,933
They begged for Eun-hee's photo.

472
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,636
Hey, didn't Eun-hee
send you Eun-joo's photo?

473
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,847
Didn't you keep
Eun-joo's photo in your wallet

474
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,898
as evidence during your service?

475
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,690
That's what the photo was used for.

476
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,661
-Did you see that too?
-No.

477
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,238
You got really tangled with my family.

478
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:19,874
Hey, that idiot Jong-pal was jealous
of Eun-hee's letter and didn't shut up.

479
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,164
That small-minded,
shallow anteater-like bastard.

480
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,538
Honey, I am the most generous man
in the world.

481
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,915
My dear husband,
that's worthy of jealousy.

482
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:31,673
That letter wasn't something
you could just sit and write.

483
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,627
It means Eun-hee peeped at this bastard

484
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,847
on his chin line and fingers
every time he took photos.

485
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,219
I said, stop it.

486
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,020
Seriously.

487
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:47,152
Eun-hee should be a writer,
not working at a publishing company.

488
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,861
And she should've dated you
instead of that bastard Jong-pal.

489
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,662
-Where's Geon-hee?
-Sleeping.

490
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,291
-Good.
-He's just like you.

491
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,948
He keeps eating and sleeping

492
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,996
endlessly.

493
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,075
Honey, let's take photos.

494
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,504
-Please take a few for us.
-Okay.

495
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,956
Smile.

496
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,601
Who's there? You might get
hurt walking around here.

497
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,600
Young-sik.

498
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,939
You're Young-sik, right?

499
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Dad.

500
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,967
Someone said

501
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,719
my wife was seen around here,
so I came here.

502
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,934
You can't even remember me,
so I couldn't tell you,

503
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,890
and people say I ran away, butâ¦

504
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,728
I'm going to go back
as soon as I find her.

505
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,903
Why are you kneeling?

506
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,574
Dad.

507
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,751
Why is life so hard?

508
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,001
It is just so hard.

509
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,801
Your child might wake up.

510
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,465
A father shouldn't cry
in front of his child.

511
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,219
Ha-ra was a bit sick.

512
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,971
I'm sorry I couldn't call you.

513
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,845
Is she okay now?

514
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,558
Yes.

515
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,107
I'm okay.

516
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,731
You should've at least texted me.

517
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,655
You answered the call
about a serious fight at night

518
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,280
and didn't call back.

519
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,497
And you didn't come to work
for a week, so I was worried.

520
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,958
Glad to see that nothing happened.

521
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,165
I was about to go.

522
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,182
You were worried

523
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,142
so why couldn't you call me first?

524
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,524
You're not curious?

525
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,100
Why don't you ask me anything?

526
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,732
What did you two do the whole week?

527
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,492
Why did you stop Ha-ra
when she asked to break up

528
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,913
three years ago?

529
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,872
Why do you want to break up with her now,
when you stopped her then?

530
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,787
What's the point of knowing these?

531
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,995
Is asking every single thing,

532
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,336
forcing the other to answer,

533
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,844
and being emotional dating?

534
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,389
I don't want to be

535
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,806
in such an immature relationship
at my age.

536
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,403
We're closed for today.

537
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,148
Didn't Eun-joo come today?

538
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,316
She stopped by during the day.

539
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,489
I'm quitting this place soon.

540
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,664
So stop tricking people
and live a good life.

541
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,172
And you need to trick people
when necessary.

542
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,592
You don't need to be honest
to those who hurt you and are rude to you.

543
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,943
EUN-JOO

544
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,232
The caller cannot be reached.
Please record your messageâ¦

545
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,937
When you're finished recordingâ¦

546
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,910
I worked late all week.

547
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,907
When I think about it now,

548
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,118
I've been waiting for you.

549
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,956
One day, two days, three daysâ¦

550
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,380
As time went by,

551
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,379
actually, I felt more comfortable.

552
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,045
Being out of reach for one week.

553
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,521
That's plenty to end our relationship.

554
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,227
Because it's your fault.

555
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,361
Felt like there was no fault in me.

556
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,819
I felt relieved.

557
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,074
I am sorry as well.

558
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,741
It seems like I'm using your hardship
as a reason to end this.

559
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,084
Just so I can come to you, Iâ¦

560
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,660
I spent a week that was harder
than I expected.

561
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,752
I thought you would understand me
because I trusted you.

562
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,665
I'm glad that you didn't call me secretly
by leaving someone sick behind,

563
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:13,141
and I'm glad that you're polite
to the end even when you're breaking up.

564
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,012
I really do think so.

565
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,230
Don't talk anymore for today.

566
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,059
You waited for me. That's all I need.

567
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,095
I'm sorry.

568
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,319
I am done.

569
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,488
I won't do this anymore.

570
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,771
TAE-HYUNG

571
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,739
Yes, Tae-hyung.

572
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,738
Eun-joo is out of reach.

573
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,951
She's not home at this hour.

574
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,071
Do you know anything about it?

575
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,028
No.

576
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,622
Didn't she tell you
she's going to see Mom?

577
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,499
She didn't.

578
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,709
Can you call your mother
and ask her, please?

579
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,378
Okay, I'll call you back.

580
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,476
They're like two kids raising a baby.

581
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,057
Go home. I'll clean it up.

582
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,935
This is not something for you to do.

583
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,652
You act like you're a generous CEO.

584
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,113
We ate it too.
So you can't clean everything alone.

585
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,775
Don't worry about it. Go home.

586
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,783
I'll do it. My hands are the fastest.
Go home, now. Go home.

587
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,076
-It's okay. Go home.
-Bye.

588
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,119
-Bye.
-Bye.

589
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,793
DID MY SISTER CALL YOU BY ANY CHANCE?

590
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,493
When did you come?
You should've called me when you came.

591
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,828
Did you wait for a long time?

592
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,247
Tae-hyung called me.

593
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,396
You sent Mom alone.

594
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,688
I heard you told Mom to tell me herself.

595
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,202
You said being alone is like poison
and you pushed Mom

596
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,200
into such an occasion?

597
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,947
I don't know that much about it.

598
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,083
And I wondered if I would be of any help.

599
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,997
To be honest, I still
don't know the specifics.

600
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,722
I thought letting you know first

601
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,088
was the right thing to do.

602
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,006
What use is knowing the specifics?

603
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,894
Why would I be curious about
those who were never by my side?

604
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,274
So I can find my biological father

605
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,100
and break into tears?

606
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,765
Remember what you always said?

607
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,693
We're nothing alike.

608
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,109
You were right about that.

609
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,084
I guess I'm a lot like my real father.

610
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,448
Stop talking like that.

611
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,785
Nothing changes for me.

612
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,786
You're my sister,

613
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,076
and I'm your younger sister.

614
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,286
Nothing changes.

615
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,086
Our relationship changed.

616
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,959
How can it not change?

617
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,166
Did you think about Mom's life?

618
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,431
Because of the time period,

619
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,140
she lived with a man she doesn't love
but she can't do it anymore.

620
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,932
I learned the reason why she endured.

621
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,345
-So how can it not change?
-Dad loved Mom!

622
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,845
We saw the 22-year-old Dad.

623
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,227
We saw his genuine expression.

624
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,904
That was a long time ago.

625
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,188
I'm sure Mom hated
that expression even more.

626
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,947
Dad threw things when he got angry,

627
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,569
scared Mom, and made her
give up on everything!

628
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,867
Do you think that's love?

629
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,280
-That's violence.
-Hey!

630
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,247
Don't exaggerate! Dad isn't violent.

631
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,369
You said you look up to Dad's life
as he worked all his life.

632
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,707
You said Mom was selfish
for looking down on Dad's healthiness!

633
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,424
Weren't you the one who talked back to Mom
when Dad was looked down on by her?

634
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,716
Because I didn't know.

635
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,721
I didn't knowâ¦

636
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,259
that I was Mom's weakness.

637
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,266
Dad used that weakness.

638
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,692
He didn't use it.

639
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,645
That's not true.

640
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,527
You were a real daughter to Dad!

641
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,826
You are his real daughter.

642
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,489
I'm not his real daughter.

643
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,124
Real daughter? Fake daughter?
That's ridiculous.

644
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,923
You knowâ¦

645
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,093
You must be happy
seeing only what you want

646
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,802
and interpreting things your way.

647
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,722
Yes.

648
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,296
I keep myself low

649
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,506
and only see things I want to see.

650
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,767
It's better than being arrogant like you
and not seeing what's below you!

651
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,696
Yes.

652
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,536
I was too arrogantâ¦

653
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,246
to see my husband, right?

654
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,432
You're right.

655
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,548
I have nothing to say.

656
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,730
Family members know the weak point
that others can't see so well.

657
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,610
They can always strike
a hard blow whenever they want.

658
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,498
I must've gone crazy! Damn it.

659
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,812
Let's go.

660
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,405
I made my sister cry.

661
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,080
It felt like my heart
was shattering into pieces.

662
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,731
Eun-joo.

663
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,389
Eun-joo.

664
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,648
Eun-joo.

665
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,824
Eun-joo.

666
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:48,899
Eun-joo. No.

667
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,491
Eun-joo!

668
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,657
Eun-joo!

669
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,370
"FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE"

670
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,724
MOM

671
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,483
Aren't you asleep?

672
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,400
What about you?

673
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,770
I'm not. That's why I picked up.

674
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,733
Eun-hee.

675
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,357
Iâ¦

676
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,156
feel a bit anxious.

677
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,791
Why?

678
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,789
What?

679
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,713
Todayâ¦

680
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,705
I went to see Eun-jooâ¦

681
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,051
and

682
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,051
told her all about it.

683
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,394
And Eun-jooâ¦

684
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,941
Eun-joo'sâ¦

685
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,824
facial expression wasâ¦

686
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,660
Eun-hee.

687
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,616
Youâ¦

688
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,446
Go and see your sister.

689
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:27,711
Okay.

690
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,165
Mom.

691
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,303
Yes?

692
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,551
Ji-woo knows about it too.

693
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,974
He heard it
when Dad was leaving the hospital.

694
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,889
She's going to sleep for a while.

695
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,978
You can go home now.

696
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,903
Eun-jooâ¦

697
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,321
did this before too.

698
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,113
She suddenly couldn't breathe, andâ¦

699
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,447
Hyperventilation can happen due to stress.

700
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,162
I learned about her condition,

701
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,124
so I'll check on her tomorrow
and take care of her for a while.

702
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,174
For a whileâ¦

703
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,207
Does that mean

704
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,675
until you break up with her?

705
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,762
Yes.

706
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,310
Eun-hee.

707
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,614
Did anything else happen to Eun-joo?

708
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,862
No.

709
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,490
Nothing else happened.

710
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,341
She's eating well and getting better.

711
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,299
Yes.

712
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,878
She is getting better.

713
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,504
Hi.

714
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,329
Yes.

715
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,250
Hi.

716
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,456
We're going to talk for a moment,

717
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,091
so wait if you want.

718
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,137
You can go first.

719
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,314
Okay then, bye.

720
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,324
How did you find out about this place?

721
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,646
I remember everything.

722
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,356
I've tailed you before.

723
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:31,157
I did it more than once.

724
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,947
Tailed me?

725
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,576
I saw you two

726
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,001
getting in the car, looking happy,
in front of the fruit shop.

727
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:40,964
When?

728
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,713
Was it around this time last year?

729
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,216
I wanted to run it over with my truck.

730
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,889
Are you nuts?

731
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,048
Yes, I was nuts.

732
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,887
I, a pathetic loser, went
totally nuts in my life.

733
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,190
Why did you let me be all this time?

734
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,027
You should've ended us
and found someone better.

735
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,832
Come here.

736
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,622
Come here.

737
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,264
Sang-sik.

738
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,426
I've only heard about you,
and this is my first time seeing you.

739
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,427
You're handsome.

740
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,475
I'm sorry to come here
all of a sudden when you're resting.

741
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,399
I should've bought some fruit,
but I brought nothingâ¦

742
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,992
Anything is fine,
but you don't need to buy fruit.

743
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,621
When I was at the fruit shop,
you never came,

744
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,989
but my husband said he saw you there.

745
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,117
Honey.

746
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,246
Oh.

747
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,797
Gosh.

748
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,850
Sang-sikâ¦

749
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,388
you are quite shy.

750
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,765
Did you have to embarrass me like that?

751
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,356
Why are we like this?

752
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,078
Is it all because of me?

753
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:39,833
Well,

754
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,831
even if it's all because of me,

755
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,592
couldn't you have told me
about this and that?

756
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,173
What if I do?

757
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,133
Did you even listen?

758
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,931
What can I tell you

759
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,474
when you don't listen?

760
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,444
That's good.

761
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,058
You tell me first.

762
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,527
Tell me when you started
hating listening to me.

763
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,371
I'm not here to fight.

764
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,910
I am not here today for this. Seriously.

765
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,041
I have a last favor to ask.

766
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,170
I have something to tell you

767
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,009
and our kids.

768
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:33,169
PUBLISHING PLAN

769
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,177
When were you planning to submit this?

770
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,302
The cover of the meditation book
and its photos.

771
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,217
PHOTO BY
PARK CHAN-HYUK & GOLDEN GOOSE MEDIA

772
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,271
Mr. Park Chan-hyuk,
the CEO of Golden Goose.

773
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,232
You know that he's my friend, right?

774
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,153
I hope you don't get the wrong idea,

775
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,232
but the photos are great.

776
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,738
It's nothing like using connections

777
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,399
or making corrupt requests.

778
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,408
The author recommended it too.

779
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:01,040
He and the company don't know yet.

780
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,868
So, are you on your way to tell him?

781
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,166
No.

782
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,539
Today I have a family meeting.

783
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:11,751
Okay. You can go.

784
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,045
Where's Tae-hyung?

785
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,098
He's busy.

786
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:06,811
Okay.

787
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,900
I came because you asked.

788
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,229
Today's the last time.

789
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,109
I'm not going to do
any more family meetings.

790
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,700
Why are you here?

791
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,294
Why are you here?

792
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,537
Just so you know, this is my room.

793
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,710
Just so you know, this was my room.

794
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,716
Let's go together.

795
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,307
Chan-hyuk has been on matchmaking dates.

796
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,564
-Matchmaking?
-Yes.

797
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,653
He's Mr. Popular.
His phone is buzzing all the time.

798
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,820
Let's go.

799
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,777
-You're home
-You're home.

800
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,318
You're home.

801
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,448
My eldest daughter.

802
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,540
I'm here.

803
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,005
Come in.

804
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,649
Come on in.

805
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,398
-Who else is coming?
-I don't know.

806
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,979
We're all family.

807
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,482
So I thought we should
at least know each other's faces.

808
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,457
Mom.
