[Nikki sighs]

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,011
I don't even know why we're doing this.
I've already got a shirt for work.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,014
You need more than one outfit, Jase.
You're not a cartoon character.

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,182
[groans]

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,767
You're a manager now.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,145
You can't go to work dressed in
the same shirt you buried your uncle in.

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,357
And we can't sit at home
waiting for news about James.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,109
As soon as you forget,
the thing that you're waiting for happens.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,194
Everyone knows that.

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,113
I don't wanna be one of those people
who sells out as soon as they make it.

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,951
I become a manager and
then suddenly I'm wearing a Â£34 shirt,

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,494
like I forgot where I came from.

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,538
Jase, this is not Dylan going electric.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,457
This is you looking smart
on your first day after promotion.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,792
-[phone buzzes]
-[both] Oh!

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,461
Oh, no, it's just Karen.

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,172
Aw, she's asked me
to go wedding dress shopping.

18
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,383
She never asks me to do things like that.

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,468
Right, I need to nail this.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,013
Maybe I should take the morning off work
tomorrow to do a mood board.

21
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,098
[mimics snore]

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,226
No, that's crazy. I'll just do
a couple of hours when I get in tonight.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,520
-Oh, look! This is nice.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,230
-Oh, that's lovely.
-You like that? Let's have a look.

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,275
Yeah. That's all right, actually, innit?

26
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,192
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I don't--

27
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,570
-Oh, ah. No, hang on a second.
-[Nikki] Yeah?

28
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,321
-[Jason] Those are little ducks.
-I know.

29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,157
-No, no. I thought they were dots.
-No, they're little ducks.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,827
Nikki, my dad's from Dagenham.
He left school when he was 16.

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,705
-I can't wear a shirt with ducks on it.
-No, they're nice ducks.

32
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm gonna spend the whole day making sure
people don't get close enough

33
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,001
to see they're not dots but little ducks.

34
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,879
-It's a lot of extra stress I don't need.
-I'm sorry. We're gonna get it.

35
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,257
It makes you look grown-up. It makes you
look like a manager, like a dad.

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,968
-Yeah, but I wanna be a cool dad.
-No. No, no, no.

37
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,929
No one wants cool parents.
My friend Cecile had cool parents,

38
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,348
and she had to do her homework
on a mini trampoline

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,518
because her mum sold her kitchen table
to pay for a clowning workshop.

40
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,645
We're just-- We're gonna be boring, okay?

41
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,105
-For James.
-Hmm. Hey.

42
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,859
You know it's not definite
that we're getting him, don't you?

43
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,569
-Yes, yes.
-Yeah?

44
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,198
No, I know. It's just... I jus--
I've got a good feeling about it.

45
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,407
-Let's have a look.
-Mm-hmm.

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,785
-[exhales] Yeah. All right, then.
-Yeah?

47
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,371
Is that the-- Yeah, right size.
Let's do it. Okay.

48
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,040
-I think it's nice.
-Okay.

49
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,792
Mate,
just so as you know, they're little ducks.

50
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,420
They made 'em really small so they look
like dots, but they're not. They're ducks.

Any news on James?

No, not yet,
but we're hoping to hear today, so...

I don't wanna get crazy with this

like some people do.

00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,264
No. Yeah, no. Of course not.

61
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,017
It's not like I've had
a vision of this day since I was a kid.

62
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,519
I'm not that sort of woman.

63
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,229
You know, I don't even wear perfume.

64
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,940
I just smell like whoever's shirt
I bought from the charity shop.

65
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,900
It's fine. It's just a dress.
Just a dress.

-[chuckles]
-Okay.

-Oh, God.

72
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,831
-Hello, muffin. Is this smart enough?
-What, to go to a shop? Yes, Mum.

73
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,916
Yeah, but it is posh, though, isn't it?

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,878
If it's not smart enough,
I'm really happy to stand outside.

75
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,755
-Oh, don't be daft.

Seriously do, um, have a read.

I'm exhausts mainly, yeah. [inhales]

it's, uh, ten exhausts to one of these,

144
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,168
so shut the garage instead.
You know what I mean?

145
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,128
Yeah, so go on. Who's getting married?

00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,050
-Uh, and what's your fella's name?
-Scott.

149
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,802
Scott? That's my middle name.

150
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,388
-[chuckles]
-Huh. Oh.

151
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,722
-How funny.
-Funny.

152
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,267
What are chances of that?
That's magic. Oh, brilliant.

153
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,269
[Daryl sighs] Right.

154
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,146
So, uh, you know, style-wise, what ya--

155
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,898
What are you gonna go for then?

156
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,026
Well, just don't wanna look shit.

157
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,196
Okay, yeah. No, fair play, fair play.

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,447
Um, Melinda.

159
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,617
Uh, the steer is "not shit."

160
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,494
-Sure, we can do that. [chuckles]
-Thanks, love.

161
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,329
-Would you like to follow me?
-Go on, Karen.

162
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,873
[Daryl] Go on. Enjoy yourself.

163
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,332
-[Daryl] Ah.
-Whoo-hoo.

164
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,667
Ah, she'll have a nice time.

165
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,127
Hmm.

166
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,597
-[Daryl] Aw.
-[women] Aw.

167
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,185
-"A structured applique bodice"--
-Yeah, I don't like it.

168
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,145
Okay. [clicks tongue, inhales]

169
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,774
Yeah, I do prefer the ones
with the, uh... long bit.

170
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,402
-Sleeves?
-Yeah, sleeves. That's it, yeah.

171
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,904
Yeah, sleeves.

172
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,995
"The classic A-line is a tiered chiffon
which drapes effortlessly"...

173
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,371
-No!
-It's, um...

174
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,003
-Off she goes again. [chuckles]
-Yeah. [chuckles]

175
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,591
[sighs]

176
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,303
-So is your wife very poorly then?
-Yeah, yeah.

177
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,263
Yeah. Both ends. Bless her. Yeah.

178
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,643
Here we go. Look at that.

179
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,394
-That's the business. Aw.
-Aw.

180
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,313
-Karen.
-Aw, I like it.

181
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,732
-[Nikki] Yeah. It's nice with that.
-[Daryl, Jilly] Yeah.

182
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:48,070
Cinderella once said,
"A dream is a wish your heart makes."

183
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,030
-[women] Ooh.
-[Daryl] So, you know.

184
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,076
[sighs] Oh, I don't know. It's fine.
How am I supposed to feel?

185
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,745
Well, Carol says when it's the one,
you cry. That's how you know.

186
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,622
Well, I haven't cried since 2012.

187
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,875
I don't sort of tend to go,
but when I go, like--

188
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,585
[blows] I'll go, do you know what I mean?

189
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,003
-Do ya?
-[Daryl] Yeah.

190
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,340
-Take your watch off.
-Why?

191
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,552
You don't wear a Casio watch
with a Â£2,000 wedding dress.

192
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,387
Well, how will I know what time it is?

193
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,682
It's your wedding day.
People will tell you the time.

194
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,475
-[Daryl] Mm-hmm.
-[scoffs]

195
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,811
That's why brides
don't get to the church on time.

196
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,438
People literally
taking their watches off them.

197
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,815
Don't touch me.

198
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,693
Is it her first wedding?

199
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,194
-[Jilly] Yeah.
-Yeah.

200
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,572
Oh, it is. Right, yeah.
Yeah, it's the best one, innit?

201
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,242
[Kaia] Come on, come on, come on.

202
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:40,205
-Yeah!
-[crowd cheers]

203
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,419
Yeah! [shouts]

204
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,171
Okay. All right, please.

205
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:53,218
-[woman] Forty. We're gonna make it forty.
-Forty, forty, forty, forty, forty, forty.

206
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,469
[sighs]

207
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,933
Okay. All right. So--

208
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,895
Oh, no. Hang on, don't leave. We've
still got lots of things to get through.

209
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,648
Guys. Guys, there's lots to get through
still-- you can't--

210
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,066
Do you know what that was about?

211
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,111
Why hold a meeting
if you've got nothing to say? [chuckles]

212
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,740
-[door closes]
-[sucks teeth]

213
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,709
Bloody hell.

214
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,794
[classical music continues]

215
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,922
I'm having a lovely time.

216
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,256
Aw.

217
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,761
[chuckles] Do you know, I've always
sort of wanted to be in a women's prison.

218
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,848
There's so much camaraderie, et cetera.

219
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,144
What about this?

220
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,063
-Eh, no. Nah.
-Oh, no.

221
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,733
-[Nikki] Mm-mmm.
-[sighs, groans]

222
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,403
[sighs, clears throat]

223
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,615
Do you think she's happy?

224
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,368
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

225
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,664
-You were always happy.
-[chuckles]

226
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,208
Well, in your way. [chuckles]

227
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,420
-I just want to see her smile.
-Hmm.

228
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,299
[sniffs, exhales] Any news?

229
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,760
No, not yet.

230
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,972
I've a good feeling, though.

231
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,807
[sighs]

232
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,561
What's it like?

233
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,687
What?

234
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,147
To have kids. To have all of this.

235
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,485
It's like the sun on your back.

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,405
[inhales]

237
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,408
[slurps]

238
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,080
-You know, I kissed a girl once.
-Okay. All right.

239
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,126
-[Karen] This one's not bad.
-Oh. Come on.

240
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,879
-[grunts]
-We're coming. We're coming.

241
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,380
Yeah.

242
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,215
-We're coming.
-We're coming. [chuckles]

243
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,010
[Jilly gasps]

244
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,095
[gasps]

245
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,513
[breathes heavily]

246
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:05,309
-Karen. [chuckles] That's beautiful.
-Yeah.

247
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,769
-It is.
-Is it?

248
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,689
Yeah. [sniffs]
Yeah, it is, yeah. It's banging, that is.

249
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,442
-Innit? Yeah. It's ab--
-Yeah.

250
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,445
-It's absolutely banging.
-[chuckles]

251
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,739
-I'm going, aren't I? [chuckles]
-[chuckles] Yeah.

252
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,657
[Daryl breathes shakily]

253
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,743
-Come here. [chuckles]
-[Jilly chuckles]

254
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,162
-[sniffs]
-[Jilly, Nikki laugh]

255
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,707
Ah. [clicks tongue] Oh.

256
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,833
Oh.

257
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,752
[Daryl, Nikki, Jilly laugh]

258
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,963
Bloody hell! Three grand?

259
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,424
[all sniffling, chuckling]

260
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,802
If I ask you for some management advice,

261
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,805
is there any chance of you
not being smug and annoying?

262
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,391
-Mate, of course.
-Freddy.

263
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,561
Oh.

264
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,980
-Sure?
-I'm sure.

265
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:55,108
Okay. All right. So wha-- what do I do?

266
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,487
Ah, well. Here's the thing.
Good managers are born.

267
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,489
-Can't learn how to be a manager.
-[clatters]

268
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,742
-Learned that at management school.
-Smug and annoying.

269
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,703
-Hey, Jase.
-Hiya-- Oh! Lit-- Little hug. Okay.

270
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,955
-There you go.
-Hmm.

271
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,415
-You're so British. [chuckles]
-[laughs]

272
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,709
-Any news on James?
-No. Hopefully today or tomorrow.

273
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,836
Want some caraway seed bread?

274
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,380
-No, thanks. I'm trying to give it up.
-No, try.

275
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,464
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

276
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,759
All right. Just as is? Okay.

277
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,679
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

278
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,347
-I tell you what, that is-- Yeah.
-[chuckles]

279
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,392
I'm obsessed with it. It's the main reason
I can't afford to buy an apartment.

280
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,103
-What's going on?
-Jason can't handle his staff.

281
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,729
No, it's not that. It's tricky.

282
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,482
Because it's--
Because they're my friends as well.

283
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,276
Yeah, well, that shit doesn't work.

284
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,611
You can't be their friend
if you're their boss.

285
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,529
Why not?

286
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,447
Um, well, because
people like to hate their bosses.

287
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,532
Not all the time.

288
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,993
-Did you hate your last boss?
-Yeah, but it was different 'cause we--

289
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,995
Look,
we go to the pub and things like that.

290
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,248
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
because they go there to talk about you.

291
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,584
Look, you're the pilot,
they're the passengers.

292
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,003
How'd you feel if the pilot
stopped flying the plane,

293
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,339
came and sat next to you, and started
eating a tiny bag of peanuts, huh?

294
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,635
You'd freak out. 'Cause then you're asking
yourself, "Who's flying this plane?"

295
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:05,846
[Jason] Hmm.

296
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,265
You're a grown-ass man.
Not everyone needs to like you.

297
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,433
Yeah, okay.

298
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,976
Okay, ready in 20?

299
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,729
-Yeah.
-It's gonna be a big one.

300
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,315
-The Bolivians are gonna come.
-[gulps] All of them?

301
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, yeah. [squeals]

302
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,443
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

303
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,278
Great. Clever.

304
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,655
-How's it going, mate?
-Yeah, it's great. It's great.

305
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,907
-I am knackered.
-Yeah?

306
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,533
We got in at 4:00 this morning,

307
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,786
and we were up at 7:00 to go and
help her friend move flat in Walthamstow.

308
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,871
Oh, no.

309
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,082
She's just so perky and undefeated.

310
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,419
It's like her shoulders haven't dropped
yet. When does that happen?

311
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,088
Twenty-nine in the city,
32 in the smaller towns.

312
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,507
Right. Good.

313
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,720
[phone rings]

314
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,764
Hello.

315
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,267
-What? When?
-Go, go, go.

316
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,477
All right, I'm coming.

317
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,063
-I'm coming. See ya, mate.
-Good luck.

318
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,147
[door slams]

319
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,907
Did they give a reason at all?

320
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,369
[stammers] You can say.

321
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,913
Like if they felt that
Jason didn't sell himself

322
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,623
or that he looked too stern in the photo.

323
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,792
-All me then, yeah?
-No, okay, sorry, no, it--

324
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,669
Yeah, it could be me.

325
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,546
Maybe they thought
I looked too young to be a mum.

326
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,630
Okay.

327
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,426
They chose another couple who already
had a child of a similar age to James.

328
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,553
Okay.

329
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,557
Well, I mean,
that hardly seems very fair, does it,

330
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,433
considering they already have one.

331
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,146
No, that's, uh-- That makes sense.

332
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,900
It's nice that he'll have
a brother or sister to play with, so...

333
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,528
that's the best outcome really, isn't it?

334
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:49,616
Look, I know you were all in, but this
is not the last chopper out of Saigon.

335
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,159
So what happens next?

336
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,328
Well, when things don't
just fall into place,

337
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,582
we just have to jiggle the key
in the lock a little bit. Yeah?

338
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:01,086
So, how would you like to meet some kids?

339
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,714
Yeah? Yeah, great.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bring it on.

340
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,632
Yeah, no,
I think we'd really pop in person.

341
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,010
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

342
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,763
"Adoption Activity Day." Huh.

343
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:15,142
Every six months or so, we get
all the kids we haven't found homes for

344
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,270
and all the people looking for kids and
smoosh them together in a big party

345
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,605
-and see what happens.
-Oh.

346
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,648
It's a worrying indictment
of a broken system,

347
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,650
but there is cake, so we plod on.

348
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:24,985
How many kids are we talking here?

349
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,071
Uh, 25 or so. Budget for a migraine.
[chuckles]

350
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,282
Actually,
I have the same approach to dating.

351
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,201
Group them all together
like a flat viewing.

352
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:35,287
Saves time, 'cause men my age
are rapidly losing their looks.

353
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,208
Luckily, I'm only gradually losing mine,
so it's advantage Penny. [chuckles]

354
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,586
Okay, so basically
we have two hours to bond with a child

355
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,047
and get them to like us...

356
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,341
-in fancy dress. Wow.
-Oh.

357
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,719
Oh, yeah. The theme is, uh,
"What I want to be when I grow up."

358
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:51,970
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

359
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,680
-So think on, you know?
-Okay.

360
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,892
No. Don't worry, please. It's just a bit
of football in a park with some kids.

361
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,810
Football?
Just a bit of football in the p--

362
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,103
-That's good. Yeah, it's fine.
-Yeah.

363
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,482
Yeah, don't race ahead, okay,
and overinvest emotionally.

364
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,651
Oh, God, no.
We've not been doing that. Have we?

365
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,236
-No. God, no. No, no, no.
-No.

366
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,406
[no audible dialogue]

367
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,915
Sometimes you just miss someone in time.

368
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,710
I know.

369
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,628
It's a bit like breaking up with someone.

370
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,382
You've just got to, you know,
you've got to move on.

371
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,677
Yeah, no, I don't really do that.

372
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,305
I'm still friends with
everyone I've ever slept with, so...

373
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,225
-Okay, that's unsettling.
-[grunts]

374
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,280
[sighs]
What are we gonna do about costumes?

375
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,699
Oh, yeah. Well, what did you wanna be
when you're older?

376
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:58,287
I wanted to be working
on the phones in a car rental firm. So...

377
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,038
-There you go.
-Absolutely nailed that.

378
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,332
-Boom.
-Thank you very much. What about you?

379
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,001
-My dad's friend Michael.
-Oh, yeah?

380
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,421
Yeah. He was so fun when I was a kid.

381
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,925
But then I got older and I realized
that he was, uh, just an alcoholic. Yeah.

382
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,385
[chuckles] Okay.

383
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,596
Yeah, he's-- he's-- he's dead now.
Bless him.

384
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,265
Drunk himself to death, he did.

385
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:24,688
Are we okay?

386
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,650
Yeah.

387
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,780
The kids are gonna like us, aren't they?

388
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,115
Yes.

389
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,867
[stammers]

390
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,077
Penny's right.
We just-- We shouldn't overthink it.

391
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,829
-Yeah.
-We're going to kick a football around

392
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:41,914
with some kids.

393
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,415
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

394
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,340
[grunts]

395
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,138
-[sighs]
-[thumping]

396
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,310
[thumping, loud thud]

397
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,403
-[glass clattering]
-Oh, shit.

398
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,882
Okay, we've got 20 minutes,
so we just need to be in and out.

399
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,342
Yeah, no bother. I know what I want.

400
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,638
-Here, what about this?
-No.

401
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,517
Nothing here is appropriate.

402
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,145
Is there any animal they can't sexify?

403
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,106
Armadillo? That's the one we can't crack.

404
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,401
[stammers] Excuse me. Hiya.

405
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:57,573
Um, do you have any costumes for women
that are more positive role models?

406
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,701
We got role-play, up there on the left.

407
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,078
No. Um, I mean, um,

408
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,163
the theme is
what you wanna be when you grow up.

409
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,334
So something like businessperson
or doctor, lawyer.

410
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,336
Yeah, that-- that sort of thing.

411
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,421
We got a judge.

412
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,550
Uh, yes. Perfect. [chuckles, sighs]

413
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,345
This is so bad.

414
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,640
Yeah.

415
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,394
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
I-- I can't go dressed like this.

416
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,354
Look, you-- [stammers]

417
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,650
No, all right. Okay.
What about-- What about a princess?

418
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,194
Princesses are very successful.

419
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,154
Have you seen a real-life princess, Jase?
They're miserable.

420
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,114
Not all girls wanna be princesses.

421
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,909
The last thing
I'd want for a daughter is a princess.

422
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,079
Is there anything in this shop
that is not demeaning to women?

423
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,920
-[muffled] I'm a bit nervous.
-What's that?

424
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,173
[breathes heavily]
I said I'm a bit nervous.

425
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,300
-Oh, yeah. I know.
-And hot.

426
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,303
-Imagine being inside this in Kenya.
-[stammers]

427
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,597
Oh, I was thinking, uh,

428
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,391
I might show them some of
my martial arts moves to impress 'em.

429
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,936
-From when you were a teenager?
-Yeah. What do you reckon?

430
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,020
Show me.

431
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,189
-Okay. Just hold that a second.
-I'll have the hat.

432
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,191
So, you would be...

433
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,715
Are you making this up?

434
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,009
No, it's--
I've forgotten quite a lot of it.

435
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,220
But that-- that's--
that's potentially good,

436
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,722
because if I don't know what's next,
then neither do my opponents.

437
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:46,807
-Yeah.
-So...

438
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,394
-I'd leave it. Hmm.
-[stammers]

439
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,355
-Can I have my hat?
-Yeah, your hat.

440
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,439
[Jason, indistinct]

441
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,491
[chattering]

442
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,244
[Jason] See, I knew we'd be
the only ones in fancy dress.

443
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,161
-Good.
-Yeah, but--

444
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,955
-We'll be memorable.
