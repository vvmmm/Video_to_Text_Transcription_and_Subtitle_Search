ï»¿1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,495
Hey! You!

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,973
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,441
I'm sick to death

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,639
with people talking about me
behind my back.

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,148
I'm gonna write to
the home secretary about this.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,650
Lockup! Lockup!

7
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,653
There's deals
going down all the time.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,588
Every day.
Every night.

9
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,318
What's a fax machine?

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,327
Put that bastard
on the wing, and I'll kill him.

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,953
Bastards.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,999
Put it down!
Now!

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,202
I don't approve of drugs.

14
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,866
Uh, are you gonna play, Tarzan,
or not?

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,208
It's your serve.

16
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,139
âª A wandering minstrel I âª

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,344
- âª A thing of shreds... âª
- No, no, no. Listen. Hey!

18
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,554
Lockup!

19
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,721
Lights out!

20
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,662
I should not have been brought
down here!

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,700
You stated you were
in possession of Semtex.

22
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,711
Yeah. I'm gonna blow the lot
of you to smithereens!

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,668
Now, piss off!

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,672
If Eugene Buffy has got Semtex,

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,298
then he should not be
in the block.

26
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,309
He should be in the SSU.

27
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,072
In with the big boys,
then, am I?

28
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,636
Did you find the Semtex, then?

29
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,648
Hey, what about the ammo,
the machine guns?

30
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,648
Did you find them?

31
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:23,445
Eugene Buffy,

32
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,884
reclassified prisoner
from C Wing, for admittance.

33
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,030
Right, Buffy. Move it.

34
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,785
And Brian Samora's got an Uzi
up his jumper.

35
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,688
You gonna reclassify him too?

36
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,922
I've written to Lord Longford,
you know, and Judge Tuman,

37
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,898
the Home Office,
and the prison services!

38
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,992
I've written to everyone!

39
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,848
I've written to
the home secretary, you know.

40
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,808
Probably being discussed right
now in the corridors of power.

41
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,867
All right.
Take it easy, Gov.

42
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,743
Take... Take it...

43
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,339
Stand there, Buffy.

44
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,008
Eugene Buffy.
Transfer from C Wing.

45
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,143
This a metal detector?

46
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,483
Only I've got, like, a metal
plate in me head, you know.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

48
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,057
Buffy, cell 4.

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,192
Get stripped.
Stand by your bunk.

50
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,361
Hello, Buffy darling.

51
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,169
Is that the prick
with the Semtex?

52
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,734
Just get on with your business,
Micky.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,077
Yeah. Well, he'd better keep out
of my face.

54
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:40,516
Hey, um, as we've not had
any rehearsals for some time,

55
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,460
uh, I think it would be best
for all c...

56
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,173
- Uh, excuse me!
- Come on. Listen up.

57
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,859
Settle down.

58
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,868
I think it would be best
for all concerned

59
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,337
if we had a bit of a practice
before, uh, Mrs. Ellison

60
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,874
and Mr. Richard Hallam

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,808
of the local amateur
operatic society join us.

62
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,277
When are we getting the women?

63
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,280
- Right. Oh!
- Yes. Thank you.

64
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,474
Bring on the beauties!

65
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,073
Ms. Purvis has kindly agreed

66
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,743
to continue playing the piano
for us,

67
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,447
and she will be assisted
by Mr. Samuels.

68
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,286
So, um, when everyone's ready.

69
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,952
Now, remember, everyone,
there's an intro,

70
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,724
so don't come in
till Wilfred puts his hand up.

71
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,831
That's yours, Terry.

72
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,631
Do it properly this time.

73
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,802
And you, Roddy.

74
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,573
âª A wandering minstrel I âª

75
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,844
âª A thing of shreds
and patches âª

76
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,476
âª Of ballads, songs,
and snatches âª

77
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,147
âª And dreamy lullaby âª

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:46,455
âª My catalog is long,
through every passion ranging âª

79
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,759
I tell you, Mavis,
this musical could be a fiasco.

80
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,924
- Governor.
- Yes.

81
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,376
It's the ladies
from the operatic society.

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,494
Ah. Hello. I'm Helen Hewitt.
I'm the governor.

83
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,629
Hello. I'm Carol Baker.
And this is Meryl Sharp.

84
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,637
Hello.

85
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,316
Mrs. Ellison and Mr. Hallam
are already here.

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,273
They're in my office.

87
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,742
If you'd like to go through,
I'll take you into the chapel.

88
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,041
- Officer Brent.
- This was way, please, ladies.

89
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,082
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

90
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,877
Oh, thank God
it's only one performance.

91
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,683
I didn't think they'd be
quite so, um...

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,621
- Attractive?
- Well...

93
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,650
There'll be some pushing
and shoving in the chorus

94
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,718
to get close to...
Well, at least to the blonde.

95
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,328
Do you need me before I get back
to Pavarotti?

96
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,865
Uh, yes.

97
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,366
Okay.

98
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,468
Yes.

99
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,530
I know Eugene Buffy
is reclassified,

100
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,618
but I don't think he's gonna
fit in with the heavy mob

101
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,905
in the SSU.

102
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,141
I cannot take lightly any inmate
threatening to use

103
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,377
or have in his possession
explosives.

104
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,890
Look, Brian.

105
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,861
Anything you want to tell me
stays between you and me.

106
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,363
There's nothing worrying me.

107
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,125
Do you miss your pal
Eugene Buffy?

108
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,034
No, I don't.

109
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,572
So what are you trying to say?

110
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,369
I'm not a nonce.

111
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,876
Well, I'm not, okay?!

112
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,412
I want to go back to me cell
now!

113
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,278
Brian, what are you getting
so het up about, man?

114
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,611
I'm not a nonce.

115
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,050
I've got three more years,

116
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,818
and I don't want nobody
calling me a nonce!

- âª A little tom-tit âª

00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,454
Round the mouth more.

120
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,294
If we can't hear
what you're saying...

121
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,630
And that goes for everyone!

122
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,136
What we want is enunciation.

123
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,137
Right, Ms. Purvis?

124
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,935
Absolutely, Jumbo.

125
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,872
Clear and sharp.

128
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,872
We did a production
of "The Mikado" a few years ago.

129
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,439
We are familiar with the score.

130
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,451
It's a jolly show.

132
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,181
Uh, Ms. Purvis?

133
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,688
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

134
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,054
Gentlemen.

135
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,991
Hey.
Buckle, Roddy.

136
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,327
I'd like to introduce
Mrs. Ellison, Mr. Hallam,

137
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,298
Ms. Baker...
I'm sorry. Carol.

138
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,994
Gentlemen!

139
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,333
Gentlemen.

140
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,530
Listen.

141
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,698
And Meryl.

142
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,468
As from now...

143
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,740
As from now, they will be
leading the rehearsals.

144
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,337
No, thanks.

145
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,608
Well, I am getting tickets

146
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,959
for the front row
for the performance.

147
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,645
They need a bit of a laugh
around here.

148
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,017
Prison service.
They want tickets for the show.

149
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,283
That's the good news.
The bad news is they want...

150
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,654
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

151
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,056
They want a detailed report

152
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,926
on the tape recording made by
Eugene Buffy and Brian Samora.

153
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,295
Officer Jason Hully
could find himself in court.

154
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,424
Excuse me, ma'am.

155
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,177
You see what's going on
in the exercise yard?

156
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,433
Tarzan got all the young lads
from C Wing working out.

157
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,473
- How is he working out?
- Tarzan. Yeah.

158
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,838
He signed up for every single
education program.

159
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,640
Guitar glasses, fitness,
computers... you name it.

160
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,822
Moaning about me again, are you?

161
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,940
No.
We were just discussing Tarzan.

162
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,292
He's very intelligent, you know.

163
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,460
- There you go.
- Thank you.

164
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,316
He's got the hang
of the word processors,

165
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,480
and he's writing
very good short stories.

166
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,754
He's through to the last round

167
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,417
of the Koestler
writing competition.

168
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,517
Tarzan.
Are you pulling my leg?

169
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,256
Excellent. About time we had
some success rate.

170
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,422
Okay.
I'm back to the grind.

171
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,261
Is this the, um,
"Mikado" poster?

172
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:16,167
Yes. Brian Samora made it up
on the graphics program.

173
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,698
There's only one "K"
in "Mikado."

174
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,868
- Yeah, Doctor.
- Ah.

175
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,845
Uh, Samora says
there's nothing wrong with him.

176
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,312
Well, not medically.

177
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,905
He's just not been in class
all week.

178
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,450
Well, I'll have another look
at him,

179
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,486
but if something
<i>is</i> bothering him,

180
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,384
he doesn't want to talk
about it.

181
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,816
Perhaps one of the, uh,
psychologists could have a word.

182
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,090
âª A wandering minstrel I âª

183
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,155
âª A thing of shreds
and patches âª

184
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,496
âª Of ballads, songs,
and snatches âª

185
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,696
âª And dreamy lullaby âª

186
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,299
âª And dreamy lulla-lullaby âª

187
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,971
- âª Lullaby âª
- âª Lullaby âª

188
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,980
No, no, no, no!
Look.

189
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,915
We've been through this
three times!

190
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,250
Can you...
You're still sounding throttled!

191
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,449
Look. Just open your throat
and let the sound come out, eh?

192
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,458
- Look.
- Ow!

193
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,788
A splinter.

194
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,123
That's it.
That's it.

195
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,663
Once more, please, Ms. Purvis.

196
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,894
âª A wandering minstrel I âª

197
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,802
âª A thing of shreds
and patches âª

198
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,306
âª Of ballads, songs,
and snatches âª

199
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,435
âª And dreamy lullaby âª

200
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,505
âª And dreamy lulla-lullaby âª

201
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:42,921
- âª Lullaby âª
- âª Lullaby âª

202
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,452
You keep this tight shut.

203
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,524
You wanted soap powder,
didn't you?

204
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,185
- Yeah.
- Take it.

205
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,424
You're in it now, sunshine,
and I'll be watching you.

206
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,126
Every move you make,
every breath you take,

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,135
I'll be watching you.

208
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,470
âª Oh, can't you see... âª

209
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,839
Get the shooter out of the
soap powder, you stupid git.

210
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,903
Four-eyes found it.

211
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,147
Hey.

212
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,848
If you've been sent in here
to blab,

213
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,014
I'll cut your tongue
out your cacky, flaccid face.

214
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,421
Okay.

215
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,425
- You got our Semtex?
- What?

216
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,492
You found the Semtex?

217
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,471
Don't know what you're on about.
It was just a joke.

218
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,521
If you want to sleep
and wake up,

219
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,828
you don't see or hear nothing,
all right?

220
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,731
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

221
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,304
Ms. Purvis, pianist, is waiting.

222
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,174
Oh, two minutes, Mavis.

223
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,339
And, um, could you make me
a salad for lunch?

224
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,940
I've put on pounds
with your sandwiches.

225
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay.

226
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,110
- Ah.
- Have you been to a doctor?

227
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,156
No, no. I'm fine. I'm just...
It comes and goes.

228
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,748
I'm probably addicted
to this stuff.

229
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,060
All the time
or just in the mornings?

230
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,596
Um, it's just you said
you'd been putting on weight,

231
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,064
and, um...

232
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,103
Well, you couldn't be, uh,
you know, could you?

233
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,762
Morning sickness, dizzy.

234
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,499
Couldn't be what, Mavis?

235
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,097
Pregnant.

236
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,338
Mavis, do you honestly think
I wouldn't know?

237
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,005
Besides which,
I've had a period every month.

238
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,572
Well, then you should see
a doctor.

239
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,211
This has been going on
for weeks.

240
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,017
Ms. Purvis.

241
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,118
Thank you for seeing me.

242
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,426
Is it about rehearsals?

243
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,227
No, it isn't.
Uh, it's personal.

244
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,305
It's about a prisoner...
Uh, Wilfred Samuels.

245
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,003
- I don't know his number.
- I know Mr. Samuels.

246
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,037
We want to get married.

247
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,445
I couldn't believe it.

248
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,313
Just like that, she says,
"We want to get married." Oi.

249
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,818
Do you?

250
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,953
What?

251
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,546
Want to get married?

252
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,715
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,987
You want the Range Rover back.

254
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,089
Can you stop joking
just for a minute?

255
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,222
I'm serious.

256
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,393
Do I want to get married...
to you?

257
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,494
We're not exactly
at Charing Cross, Helen.

258
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,464
Well...

259
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,478
maybe I expected to be asked
in a more romantic location.

260
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,105
My bedroom... our bedroom.
We <i>are</i> living together.

261
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,706
You use my car more than I do.

262
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,548
See? You do want
the Range Rover back.

263
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:00,814
You don't want to marry me?

264
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,490
No. Well...

265
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,356
No. I love you.
I really do, but...

266
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,207
Well, why can't we just
keep things the way they are?

267
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,223
Well, why not go
one step further?

268
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,097
Because I can't.

269
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,970
Not right now.

270
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,605
Okay.

271
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,904
Want a refill?

272
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,847
- Simon.
- Hmm?

273
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,443
I do love you, Simon.
And...

274
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,117
Just give me a bit more time,
okay?

275
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,422
Simon.

276
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,993
Sure.

277
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,194
Get those legs up!

278
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,568
Get those legs up!

279
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,901
Keep it moving!

280
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,099
Get moving!

281
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,368
Get those legs up!

282
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,441
Get it moving!

283
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,442
Oi!

284
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,308
You'll bloody well
knock that off!

285
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,084
Come on, Roddy!
You can't stop!

286
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,316
Go on!
Go on, you lazy git!

287
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,298
What do you think you're doing?

288
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,570
I'll get these flabby,
unhealthy bastards fit.

289
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,123
- Keep moving!
- To get your exercise,

290
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,422
you do it in the yard,
not the wing.

291
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,641
Get in your cell now.

292
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,841
Are you stopping me?

293
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,349
Yes, I am stopping you.

294
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,045
I'm up for the Koestler
Writer's Award.

295
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,396
That's got nothing to do
with me.

296
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,582
What you do on this wing
has got to do with me,

297
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,715
and right now you're getting up
everybody's noses

298
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,692
- charging 'round.
- It's exercise!

299
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,991
Then exercise in the yard
and not on association.

300
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,191
Now, get back to your cell.

301
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,733
Get back to your cell, Tarzan.

302
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,466
Any more of this,
and you're gonna go on report.

303
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,181
Don't you ever threaten me.

304
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,288
How about we sort that bastard
out once and for all, Governor?

305
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,292
All of them, bastards.

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,658
Smith, I told you!
In your cell now!

307
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,129
Hey, Brian, you should hear
these girls sing.

308
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,631
Never mind the knockers.

309
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,132
I'm doing a duet
with one of them,

310
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,411
and 'cause I'm playing a woman,
I can get me hands on her.

311
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,368
What do you think?

312
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,302
âª Tit willow, tit willow âª

313
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,840
âª Tits willow âª

314
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,135
Get out.

315
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,938
Eric, would you get out?!

316
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,307
Eric!

317
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,370
What's the matter with you, Bri?

318
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,938
I know. Missing your
bosom buddy, are you?

319
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,849
Eugene Buffy thinks he's a
big shot 'cause he's in the SSU.

320
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,918
Get out!

321
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,114
Oh! Shit!

322
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,188
You all right, son?

323
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,021
Yes, Mr. Jackson.

324
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,387
You all right, Brian?

325
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,529
Not like you to stay
in your cell like this.

326
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,066
I'm a little con...
Confused, Mr. Jackson.

327
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,404
I've lost me confidence.

328
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,534
Why? Has somebody been messing
with you?

329
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,636
All right, Brian?

330
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,944
No.
No one's been messing with me.

331
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,708
If they did, I'd beat them up.

332
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,354
Look, Brian.

333
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,152
If you need to talk anyone,
you just have to say the word.

334
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,357
Why don't you want to go down
to education today?

335
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,724
Is it Tarzan?

336
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,370
When is Eugene coming back
on the wing?

337
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,835
I don't know, son.

338
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,762
Gov.

339
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,133
Tarzan's getting a bit heavy.

340
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,403
He's unsettled
a lot of the regulars.

341
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,775
Well, I knew it was
too bloody good to last.

342
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,272
What are you doing?

343
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,906
I want every one
of them billiard balls

344
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,473
back in the lockup... now.

345
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,745
What do you suggest?

346
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,150
I don't know.

347
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,745
It's exercise time now.

348
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,313
I don't know, but he's
starting to control the wing.

349
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,950
Come on, slobs.
Stop playing your kid's games.

350
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,404
- Do yourself a favor...
- Put your stuff away.

351
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,939
And don't end up on the block
again.

352
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:37,896
Let's train!

353
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,298
It was my decision
to put Tarzan back on the wing,

354
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,892
and he's showing
great improvement.

355
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,734
In fact, today I was told
he's got through

356
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,899
to the final of the Koestler
writing competition.

357
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,101
Oh.

358
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,074
Is this his wing?

359
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,169
Uh, B and C Wing. Yes.
They exercise together.

360
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,677
I'd like to congratulate him.

361
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,115
Morning.

362
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:01,920
Mr. Bunny?

363
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,616
Morning.
Can you call Tarzan over?

364
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,592
Do you know how many tickets
there's gonna be for the show?

365
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,061
- Tarzan.
- Morning.

366
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,688
Tarzan.

367
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,096
Mr. Tarzan, I'm the area manager
of Barfield...

368
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,728
- Aah!
- Aah!

369
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,466
- Jackson!
- Let me down!

370
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,031
Aah! Aah!

371
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,140
Yes!

372
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,305
Hey!

373
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,906
I'm telling you,
he picked him up and threw him.

374
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,450
I mean, not like that.
Like that.

375
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,849
Ah. Eugene.

376
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,617
You don't fancy some fresh air,
Eugene?

377
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,900
No.
I want to make a phone call.

378
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,621
Sorry, pal.
Not from here, you can't.

379
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,704
- I want to see the governor.
- You know the rules.

380
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,855
Put it on a request form.

381
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,297
I hope you do know the rules,
Eugene.

382
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,664
- Vernon, exercise.
- Right, Billy.

383
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,465
What about you, Terry?
Are you not exercising tonight?

384
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,007
You know, if I write a note,
will you see it gets delivered?

385
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,239
Depends, Eugene.

386
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,841
It's just to a mate of mine
on C Wing... Brian Samora.

387
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,077
I don't want to stay here.

388
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,588
Come on into the yard, Eugene.
We're playing handball.

389
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,021
I don't want to play handball.

390
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,290
Don't you want any lunch, Brian?

391
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,957
Trolley's on the wing.

392
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,526
I'm not hungry.

393
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,874
Look.

394
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,381
If it makes you feel any better,
we're moving Tarzan out.

395
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,017
I've got to speak to Eugene.

396
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,020
Got to.

397
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,951
Give me a note.

398
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,420
I'll see that he gets it.

399
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,498
Okay?

400
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,933
Mr. Jackson, hurry it up,
will you?

401
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,061
I want you down here.

402
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,128
No worry, boss.

403
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,844
Getting nervous, are we?

404
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,243
Come here, you.

405
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,804
Right, Mr. Jackson.

406
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,907
You know that Keith Smith's due
in court tomorrow.

407
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,316
Van will be at reception early.
Got a long way to travel.

408
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,049
Now, we need to clear
Tarzan's possessions

409
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,282
and get him to sign for them.

410
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,792
He had quite a lot of gear
for a fairly short stay with us.

411
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,658
Right. He's probably nicked
half of it and all.

412
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,689
God.

413
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:30,260
Actually, he's not got a lot
for 27 years, has he?

414
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,271
Here you are, boss.
Read some of that.

415
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,102
Oh, good stuff.

416
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,174
Library.

417
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,276
Library.
See?

418
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,109
He's filched half of this
from out the nicks' libraries.

419
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,479
Hang on a second.

420
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,849
Eugene Buffy.

421
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,187
Now, that's not a music tape.

422
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,090
The little bastards said they'd
got it stashed in a safe place.

423
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,099
Rope's finished.

424
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,778
We've got the poles ready
and we're all set.

425
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,896
One call, and we get transport
standing by.

426
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,050
Saturday it is, then.

427
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,836
Be with the wife
for the weekend.

428
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,501
Watch this prick.

429
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,009
I think he's here
to inform on us.

430
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,912
Lunch is up, lads.

431
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,975
That's okay, Vernon.
I'm having steak today.

432
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,779
Ah.

433
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,988
You hungry, Eugene?

434
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,719
What do you fancy?

435
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,784
Slab of filet?

436
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,557
Or a piece of chicken breast?

437
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,533
Eugene.

438
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,165
Are you all right?

439
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,339
Lockup, lads!
Spread them out! Come on!

440
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,224
I'm getting
very nervous about tomorrow.

441
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,342
I've got a tickle
in me bloody throat.

442
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,976
I've been sucking
these bloody Tunes

443
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,418
till they're going out
of fashion.

444
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,785
And I can't get me voice.

445
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,153
Hully!

446
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,953
Unlike that little bastard.

447
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,051
Hey, Keith!
Due in court tomorrow, eh?

448
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,723
Hey, Smithy!
I'm talking to you, Smithy!

449
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,527
Shut it, wanker.

450
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,761
Burt, stop talking
and keep walking.

451
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,961
In your cell.

452
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,061
Nighty-night, Brian.

453
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,370
Stop messing around
and get in your cell now.

454
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,303
I won't be able to sleep.
First-night nerves.

455
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,310
Big day tomorrow.

456
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,589
Are you going to the show,
Mr. Brent?

457
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,842
I for sure am, yeah.

458
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,440
Hey, Mr. Jackson, if Buffy's
not coming back on the wing,

459
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,076
can I bunk in with Brian?

460
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,485
Jack Binter's got
terrible stinking feet.

461
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,852
Don't make us say it again.

462
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,754
Get in your cell now.

463
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,955
Lockup!

464
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,590
HADDOCK

465
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,760
Lockup, Brian.

466
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,895
You are going to showers
tomorrow.

467
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,802
Lights out!

468
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,132
Lights out!

469
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,372
âª Tit willow, tit willow âª

470
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,377
Brian.

471
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,880
We found the second tape
in Tarzan's cell,

472
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,211
you little Scouse shit.

473
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,810
- Full house?
- Yeah.

474
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,684
Locked up, banged up,
and the Scouser's wound up.

475
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,155
Well, the word is him and the
cellmate recorded the soft git

476
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,890
asking them to beat up some con

477
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,329
who'd been giving him
a hard time.

478
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,696
Eh?

479
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,292
Now it looks like Officer Hully
<i>is</i> going to trial,

480
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,200
and if he gets sent down,
God help him.

481
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,529
The bastard.

482
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,632
Who wants some chicken?
Cooked up too much.

483
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,075
- No, thanks.
- No, thanks. Got me sandwiches.

484
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,875
Are you sure?
It'll only go to waste.

485
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,711
No takers?

486
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,988
Hey. Hey.

487
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,720
I don't want any.

488
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,195
Oh, Jesus.

489
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,665
He saw the rope.

490
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,436
Taking a shower.

491
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,542
Mind that chicken bone, Eugene.

492
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,044
A lot of people choke to death
on a chicken bone.

493
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,807
Micky, are you still
in the showers?

494
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Come on.

495
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,878
Sort him out, Micky.

496
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,752
It's getting too close
for cock-ups.

497
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,291
What are we gonna do?

498
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:16,352
We're gonna deal with it.
We've got two days.

499
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,299
I'm off.

500
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,358
Don't forget your appointment
with the doctor

501
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,527
tomorrow at 4:00.

502
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,535
What?

503
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,662
I thought it'd be okay,

504
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,969
as you'll be going home
to change for the show.

505
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,508
Oh, yeah.

506
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,774
Uh, Mavis, could you, um,
uh, organize some flowers

507
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,872
for Ms. Purvis
and the operatic ladies?

508
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,348
Will do.
See you tomorrow.

509
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,112
- Yep. Good night.
- Good night.

510
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,791
âª I'm too young to die âª

511
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,799
âª And too old to tell lies âª

512
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,525
âª I couldn't help you âª

513
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,767
âª I couldn't help me,
my friend âª

514
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:08,144
âª But without you, my friend,
I'm terrified âª

515
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,854
You okay, Eugene?

516
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,457
Look, thanks for this, Gov.

517
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:22,461
Um, it's to Brian Samora
on C Wing.

518
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,020
I can't remember his number.

519
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,431
All right.

520
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,696
But this is against regulations,
you know.

521
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,137
I know, but I'm not
one of these bastards.

522
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,141
I'm not real CAT-A.

523
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,875
I lied about the Semtex.
I lied.

524
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,004
It was a joke.

525
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,682
Good night, Eugene.

526
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,377
Good night, Gov.

527
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,553
Don't hang about, Eric.

528
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,533
You've been in front
of that mirror for 10 minutes.

529
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,490
Still doing his hair.

530
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,135
Getting all ponced up
for the dress rehearsal.

531
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,971
You've been doing a bit
of Brylcreaming and all.

532
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,725
Same could be said of you,
Mr. Jackson.

533
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,322
- Like Old Spice, do you?
- Get on. Get moving.

534
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,890
Come on.
Shift it.

535
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,492
Where's Brian?
Eight.

536
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,094
- You all right, Terry?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,264
- A bit nervous, Mr. Jackson.
- Well, don't worry.

538
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,864
Let's go, lads.

539
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,137
- Come on, Brian.
- Samora, come on!

540
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,702
Hey. He's been taking
those throat sweets.

541
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,690
He thinks he's gonna lose
his voice for the musical.

542
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,741
We should be so lucky.

543
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,841
Brian?

544
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,048
Brent! Chizzy!
Get back here!

545
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,854
Brian.

546
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,556
Brent! Chizzy!
Get in here!

547
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,832
Brent!
Chizzy!

548
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,178
We've arranged a transfer
for you, Mr. Snooper,

549
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,880
but we want the names of the men
you know to be dealing...

550
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,922
The barons, the runners,

551
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,322
and the prisoners you know
are being threatened.

552
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,256
What protection do I get?

553
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,989
You'll be out of here.

554
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,998
But first we want
the information.

555
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,727
And we'll check it out.

556
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,200
And how you gonna do that, man?

557
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,271
If I give you names and you
start ducking and diving about,

558
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,932
them is gonna know
that me are the grass.

559
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,943
You could also give us any name
you pulled out of a hat.

560
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,137
Oh, man.

561
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,340
You not get what you want
from my information?

562
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,983
You're in charge here, right?

563
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,144
You mean to tell me you can't
get me back inside here?

564
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,415
Hmm?

565
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,091
I wouldn't screw you.

566
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,217
A deal is a deal, right?

567
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,490
I swear on my kids' life.

568
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,299
Two kids' life.

569
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,029
No.

570
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,303
You got to get off this wing
beforehand, man,

571
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,174
because them men out there will
look upon me and they will know.

572
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,579
And that'll be me dead or me
have to kill somebody, right?

573
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,378
You understand me?

574
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,854
- Please.
- Easy.

575
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,513
Please.

576
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,092
Gov, can I see you for a second?

577
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,624
You'd better not be
messing us about, Snoopy.

578
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,895
I wouldn't do that to you, man.

579
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,061
What?

580
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,003
I deal with you on the level.
You know what I mean?

581
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,273
Look. You is a good man, right?
Me know you is a good man.

582
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,742
'Cause me see you operate,
right?

583
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,438
- Me see you.
- Hey.

584
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,512
Officer Jackson?

585
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:33,178
Names, barons, dealers, users.

586
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,683
Gary.

587
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,890
Nothing I can do.

588
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,197
Silly little bastard.

589
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,571
You all right?

590
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,309
I give him mouth-to-mouth, Gary.

591
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,045
But he was dead
when I cut him down.

592
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,310
Hey.
Hey.

593
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,325
I'll wait
till the police get here.

594
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,793
They found him
in the end cubicle.

595
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,024
Does anybody know why?

596
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,032
And does it have anything to do
with us finding

597
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,091
- that bloody tape?
- I don't know.

598
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,466
Governor Syons said he thought

599
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,472
maybe Tarzan was having a go
at him, but no note, nothing.

600
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,405
I'd better wait
for the coroner's report.

601
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,186
In the meantime,
I'd better contact his family.

602
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,143
- Yes.
- Um, sorry.

603
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,655
Do you want to cancel
the dress rehearsal?

604
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,190
Mrs. Ellison and everyone
are at reception.

605
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,273
- No.
- Was he in the show?

606
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,476
No.
Let it go on.

607
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,328
Better they have something
to take their mind off it.

608
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,513
They don't know yet.

609
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,665
They were all out of the shower
before Jackson found him.

610
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,920
One of the SSU officers
brought this.

611
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,619
It's from Eugene Buffy.

612
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,864
"Dear Brian, I'm being got at in
here, and they won't let me out.

613
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,492
You've got to write
to the Home Office."

614
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,469
Somebody had better tell him

615
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,098
before the, uh, starts
on the grapevine.

616
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,369
Morning, ma'am.

617
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,437
Why the hell are these curtains
still up?

618
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,982
I gave instructions
for them to be taken down.

619
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,327
You must have visibility
and access...

620
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,412
Ma'am, they said it was
an invasion of their privacy,

621
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,479
just like they did
with the security lights.

622
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,457
Is it?
Well, that <i>is</i> a workroom.

623
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,823
It is not a sauna.
Get them taken down today.

624
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,327
- Yes, ma'am.
- Eugene.

625
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,424
Could you turn that TV off,
please?

626
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,162
Quickly, please.

627
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,465
Quickly, please.

628
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,536
Sit down, Eugene.

629
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,604
Am I going back on the wing?

630
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,679
I'm afraid I have some bad news
for you, Eugene,

631
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,064
and I wanted to tell you
personally.

632
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,317
I've been expecting it.

633
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,291
You've found the other tape,
haven't you?

634
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,827
You're not gonna do anything
about that bent screw.

635
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,828
You're all bent, the lot of you.

636
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,525
Eugene, this isn't about
the tape,

637
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,159
and the officer involved <i>is</i>
going to be charged over that.

638
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,896
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this.

639
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,069
Brian Samora committed suicide
this morning.

640
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,703
No.

641
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,878
I know he was your friend
and your cellmate.

642
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,644
No.

643
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,914
No.

644
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:27,454
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- No. No.

645
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,526
No.

646
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,329
- If you'd like Dr. Williams...
- No!

647
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,768
No. No.

648
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,141
Keep an eye on him.

649
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,474
Ma'am.

650
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,148
And I want those curtains down
today.

651
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,116
Yes, ma'am.
Good day, ma'am.

652
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,812
They're all after me.

653
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,817
It's a conspiracy.

654
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,725
Oh, they killed Brian.

655
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,728
They killed Brian.

656
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,626
They'll come for me next.

657
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,105
Gonna kill me.

658
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,902
They're gonna kill me.

659
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,142
Okay. I'm going now.
I'll see you later.

660
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,909
Art department made them up.
Correct spelling this time.

661
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,449
We might have to do
more than one.

662
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,677
Not got a seat left.

663
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,878
God forbid.

664
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,352
Oswald Snooper is on his way,

665
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,480
and we've got Keith Smith back
for 12 years.

666
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,888
I know. Took the jury
less than 10 minutes.

667
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,086
I'll see you later.

668
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,184
Where's she going?

669
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,093
Could you put these up
in the chapel

670
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,327
and take the ones down
that are spelled wrong?

671
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,868
Have you booked a ticket?

672
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,869
Are you kidding?
The lads have got three rows.

673
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,839
Oh, and could you take
these flowers over?

674
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,702
Leave them at the side
of the stage.

675
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,336
Bloody hell, Mavis.

676
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,412
Look!

677
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,277
Right. My ball.

678
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,782
Yah!

679
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,649
Still talking to yourself,
Eugene?

680
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:01,743
- Yeah.
- Ha.

681
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,083
From now on, I talk to you.

682
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,623
Oh, yeah?
Just like that, eh?

683
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,851
- Mm.
- Piss off.

684
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,362
I know you're planning
going over the wall on Saturday.

685
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,556
He's a nutter.

686
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,757
Am I?

687
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,801
It's that it should be tonight.
They're putting on a big show.

688
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,302
All the cons and screws
will be busy.

689
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,032
What do you want, Eugene?
Hmm?

690
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,574
You want this stuffed down
your throat?

691
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,371
No.
I want to come with you.

692
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,477
âª To the matter
that you mention âª

693
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,913
âª I have given some attention âª

694
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:36,911
âª And I think
I am sufficiently decayed âª

695
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,719
You need your makeup, Terry.

696
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,987
And you need more eye makeup,
Richard.

697
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,722
I-It's Roddy, Carol.
Roddy.

698
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,526
Oh.
I'm so sorry, Roddy.

699
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:49,090
I'll do your eyes and lips.

700
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,602
Uh, Meryl is doing yours, Eric.

701
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,662
Carol, do I need
any more makeup?

702
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:57,732
Uh, no, but ask Mr. Hallam.

703
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,404
He's doing most of the maids.

704
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,449
Now, then, though of you
who are still unsure about...

705
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,417
It'll all soon be over.

706
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,546
I can't think about it.
I get so upset.

707
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,716
Then don't,
because it isn't over for us.

708
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,488
Oh, I must run through
some of the songs with you.

709
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,496
You're a little bit late
turning the pages.

710
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,465
During the performance,
this here...

711
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,432
is stage right.

712
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,870
And this is stage left.

713
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,305
If you're not onstage
but waiting in the wings,

714
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,501
no talking.

715
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,669
And if you have any quick
changes, rehearse them now,

716
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,110
because it's your last chance.

717
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,072
All right.
Listen up.

718
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,946
Ms. Hewitt's gone
to get ready for tonight,

719
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,041
so I'll get cracking.

720
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,381
This ruddy show.

721
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,081
You know,
I've not had time for lunch.

722
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,433
Do you know how many officers
are required just for security?

723
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,497
Yeah. And you'll need a hell
of a lot more for this.

724
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,119
Oswald Snooper.

725
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,322
I have a list here,
and you won't believe it.

726
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,697
Thirty-five known dealers,
five barons,

727
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,793
numerous inmates
who are under pressure

728
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,839
to bring in cocaine, heroin,
and crack.

729
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,933
Gary... Gary, uh,
Russell Morgan is in with Mavis.

730
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,843
Uh, she wants to know
if the flowers are in water.

731
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,642
Tell her yes, yes, yes.

732
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,410
Now, can we just get back
to this?

733
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:16,080
If you look at the names,
you'll see there's also listed

734
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,350
eight officers.

735
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,288
Bit of a panic all 'round today.

736
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,554
We've got this musical.

737
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,653
- I can always come back, Mavis.
- No, no, no.

738
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,707
Gary Marshall will go bananas
if he knew you'd been in

739
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,975
and not seen him.

740
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,627
Excuse me.

741
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,693
Mrs. O'Connell.

742
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,830
Yes, I'll hold.

743
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,541
You're looking very well,
Russell.

744
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,079
How's Nora?

745
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:44,981
Oh, it's been tough on her,
maybe even more than me.

746
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,748
I've applied for a job
with a security company.

747
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,312
Oh, that's good.

748
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,389
Yeah.

749
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,586
Edward Stretton.
Yeah.

750
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,959
He's the photographer.
I sent you his particulars.

751
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:03,402
He's to photograph the cast
for the prison magazine, and...

752
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:08,273
Ms. Hewitt will be back
any minute now, okay?

753
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,933
I'm in the way.

754
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,477
I just wanted to say thanks
for this Simon Lennox.

755
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,809
Very positive.
He's a good chap.

756
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,111
Reckons I might get
some compensation,

757
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,016
so add that to the pay out,
and might be okay.

758
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,543
Look who's here.

759
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,580
Hello, me old son.

760
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,053
It's good to see you.

761
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,925
You're looking very sharp.
How are you doing?

762
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:31,929
Is she back yet?

763
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,296
I may be going to work
for a security company.

764
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,699
Well, the Service will always
have you back, wouldn't they?

765
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,293
Mavis, she's cutting it
a bit fine.

766
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,380
- You know what...
- No, Gary.

767
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,872
Not with my medical records.

768
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,465
They've got me down
as a fruit-and-nut... Hey.

769
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,086
We'll maybe have a drink
sometime, yeah?

770
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,134
Hang on. Hang on.
Look.

771
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,451
Let's go up to the lounge.
Some of the lads are up there.

772
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,880
We're getting a darts match on.
Come on.

773
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,577
Would you hold on a moment?
Gary.

774
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,846
- Yeah.
- Can you take this?

775
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,546
It's something about Tarzan.

776
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Hang on, Russ.

777
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,584
What time is she coming back,
Mavis?

778
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,287
Yeah. Marshall.

779
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,488
I'm just gonna change, Gary.

780
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,860
Yeah.

781
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,423
Yeah.

782
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,993
Yeah. Right.
I'll pass it on.

783
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,530
I don't believe that.

784
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:18,043
Tarzan has just got second
in the Koestler writing prize.

785
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,044
- What do you want?
- Where's the governor?

786
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,103
We need more officers
to bring in the audience.

787
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,341
How do I know?

788
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,350
She's having her hair done,
I suppose.

789
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,750
I've had it all up to here.

790
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,550
We need this
like a ruddy hole in the head.

791
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,509
Mr. Bunny has just arrived.

792
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,746
How many months?

793
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:30,814
Four.

794
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,109
I don't believe it myself.

795
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,086
I-I thought it was
food poisoning.

796
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,281
My God, Helen.

797
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,347
All that stuff
you've been taking, it won't...

798
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,189
I mean, it... it can't harm it,
can it?

799
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:47,364
The doctor says it shouldn't,
and he says I'm very fit.

800
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,096
I didn't know...
I still <i>don't</i> know how I feel.

801
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,299
Shocked?
I know <i>I</i> do.

802
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,366
Well, I have to have it.
I'm... It's over four months.

803
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,369
I just...

804
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,244
I feel stupid.

805
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,648
I should have known.

806
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,118
Well, now you do know.

807
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,549
We both know.

808
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,920
So I'm going to try again.

809
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,897
I now formally ask all one
and almost a half of you

810
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,494
to marry me.

811
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,512
I love you.

812
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,273
Oh, I was scared that you...

813
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,343
I-I mean, I don't want you
to feel, you know, that you...

814
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:50,556
I want you, Helen,
and I want our baby.

815
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,629
So, third time lucky...

816
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,066
will you marry me?

817
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,516
You free for dinner tonight,
Ms. Hewitt?

818
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,250
Oh, my God. What time is it?

819
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,087
- Oh, my God. I have to go.
- What?

820
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,319
No.
I'm serious.

821
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,570
It's the show.
It's "The Mikado."

822
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,029
- I can't be late.
- Well, you want me to drive you?

823
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,257
No, no.
I'll be fine.

824
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,596
It will be finished by 8:00,
and I'll come straight back.

825
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,162
I love you.

826
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,480
Well, one good thing about
putting on a show in the nick...

827
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,885
You've got a captive audience.

828
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,150
- Where's the governor?
- I'm trying to track her down.

829
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,419
You're gonna have to
start it off if she's not here.

830
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,960
We can't keep them waiting.

831
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,293
I know. I know.
Let's get over there.

832
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,597
Bloody mayhem out there.

833
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,297
They've got a full house
for that show, you know.

834
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,036
Said they weren't gonna
let me in.

835
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:14,944
I said, "Hey, soft lad.
I frigging work here."

836
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,383
How about a game of hardball?
This program sniffs.

837
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,852
Show hasn't started yet.

838
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,479
- Got to wait for the start.
- Shut up.

839
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,194
It's a big opening number.
Loads of music.

840
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,256
- Shut up.
- Okay.

841
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,486
Come on.

842
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,666
- Is she here?
- No. She's caught in traffic.

843
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,573
So I'll go on and open the show,
yeah?

844
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,643
All right.

845
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,455
I won't make any speeches.

846
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,426
Just to say a warm welcome
to everyone.

847
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,028
Now, this is really
the inmates' night,

848
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,937
and they wanted to show
their appreciation.

849
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,737
Please.

850
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,904
Thanks to Ms. Purvis,
our musical director.

851
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:36,385
Tonight's performance, as
requested by everyone on C Wing,

852
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,760
is dedicated to Brian Samora.

853
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,662
Thank you.

854
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,325
And everyone enjoy the show.

855
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,853
- Good evening, lads.
- Night, Vernon.

856
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,106
Lights on and off, Billy.

857
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,977
Oh, go on, then.
Usual before beddy-byes.

858
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,278
Looks like you lads
have tidied up in here.

859
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,283
Very impressed.

860
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,286
Not this crap again, lads,
please.

861
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,822
Probably seen this six times.

862
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,018
How you going, Liam?
You all right?

863
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,357
Come on.
Cheer up.

864
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:14,661
âª For wherever our country's
banner may be planted âª

865
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,362
âª All other local banners
are defied âª

866
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,338
âª Our warriors
in serried ranks assembled âª

867
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:27,539
âª Never quail
or they conceal it if they do âª

868
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,509
Tea and sandwiches
won't be long.

869
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,963
The other fella
not working out with you?

870
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,353
He was getting too old, son.

871
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,502
I think it's that workout
I showed you the other day.

872
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,934
I think it knackered us.

873
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,903
Well, they're flying
Pam Anderson in for me tonight,

874
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,860
so I'll be all right, kid.

875
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,989
Pam Anderson? Well, if she comes
alone, I might just join you.

876
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,398
Well, there you go.
Catch.

877
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,884
Hand over that stick.
Hands on the table.

878
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,467
Hands on the table!

879
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,478
Get over here!
Get over here!

880
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,138
Get the fuck down!

881
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,415
âª Three little maids from school
are we âª

882
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,517
âª Pert as a schoolgirl
well can be âª

883
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,028
âª Filled to the brim
with girlish glee âª

884

âª Three little maids
from school âª

Here we go.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,291
Keep up.

887
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,837
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on!

888
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,736
Would you get down?

889
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,434
Come on, Billy.

890
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:31,635
Shut it.

891
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,507
Shut up.

892
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,039
âª Three little maids who,
all unwary âª

893
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,084
âª Come from a ladies' seminary âª

894
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,984
âª Freed from its
genius tutelary âª

895
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,885
âª Three little maids
from school âª

896
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,515
- Shit.
- I told you... Shut your mouth.

897
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,266
Go. Go.

898
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,998
Clear. One down.
Two to go.

899
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,071
Go!

900
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,772
Go, lads.
Keep against the wall.

901
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,543
Keep against the wall!

902
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,353
- Shut it!
- Come on. Move it.

Go. Come on!
Go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

âª From three little maids,
take one away âª

905
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,890
âª Two little maids remain
and they âª

âª Won't have to wait very long
they say âª

âª Three little maids
from school âª

908

Don't rattle.
Don't rattle. Don't rattle.

909
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,571
Liam, poles.
Poles, poles. Poles. Come on.

- Up, up, up, up, up, up.
- Hook them on.

916
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,587
âª If that is so,
sing derry, down derry âª

âª It's evident, very,

Ouch.

Relax.
Relax.

922
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,304
We're nearly there.

00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:15,078
Come on! Go!

924
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,044
Steady.

- Stay. Wait.
- Okay. Okay.

926
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,888
Wait.

00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,329
Eugene, you know what to do,
right?

930
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,926
I know.
I'm gonna shoot them down.

931
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,083
You're the big man, Eugene.

932
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,662
I'm gonna shoot the...

933
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,105
