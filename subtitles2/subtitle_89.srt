00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,672
Nick!

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,673
Look at me.

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,675
I'm gonna get our son back.

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,610
Don't move.

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,012
Come on.
It's okay.

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,680
This ain't over.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,752
Noah's back.

8
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:23,155
He got special leave and decided
to surprise me for a few days.

9
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,090
I knew
that you were married.

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,760
Have you noticed anything
different about...

11
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,428
Julia and Baz lately?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,495
Like what?

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,431
They've been hanging out
a lot...

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,699
without you.

15
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,568
I don't want you
to feel left out.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,506
âªâª

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,508
Excuse me.
A-Are you Pope?

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,178
I'm Taylor's mom.

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,579
Thanks for coming.

20
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,381
You look good.
So do you.

21
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,715
I owe you an apology.

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,050
I judged you.

23
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,318
When what I should have done
was forgiven you.

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,767
âª Come and meet my black hole âª

33
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,638
âª Got a big black hole âª

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,508
âª Got a big black hole âª

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,045
âª I've got a big black hole âª

36
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:57,382

37
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:01,386

âªâª

48
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,349
Yeah, it's that
fiber-optic shit. So?

49
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,551
So the county's going to
announce next week

50
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:43,088
that they're putting these
in every one of their buildings.

51
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,624
Schools, courthouses...

52
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,394
I work for the county. I ain't
heard nothing about that.

53
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,499
That's gonna be
a lot of cable.

54
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,236
Truckloads.

55
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,704
I don't know.

56
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,505
Hard to keep track
of it all.

57
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,108
You know how close
they watch that?

58
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,779
I know<i> exactly</i>
how close they watch it.

59
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,515
I'd give 'em a B-minus.

60
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,185
Come on.

61
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:17,590
Couple spools for every delivery
winds up on one of my trucks...

62
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,858
that's not a problem.

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
But then
you got to move it.

64
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:26,665
Oh, gosh. Where am I gonna find
contractors looking for a deal?

65
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,401
Push it.

66
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,272
Push it.

67
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,741
Come on, Pope,
you got one more in you.

68
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,478
Baz, help him.

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,948
Are you gonna let it crush you,
or are you gonna crush it?

70
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,087
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

71
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,555
Never a doubt.

72
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,024
See that, Deran?

73
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,960
That's how
winners are made.

74
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,563
Told you he had it.

75
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:04,837
âªâª

76
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,372
Hey,
what do you think, Pope?

77
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,309
Should we get Julia
on the bench next?

78
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,977
She's a girl.

79
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,046
Girls do aerobics.

80
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,380
You're a Neanderthal.

81
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,817
You know
what that means?

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,187
It's a subspecies of humans
that went extinct...

83
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,722
40,000 years ago.

84
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:24,990
Alright, smartass.

85
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,325
Hey,
you know you can't get

86
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,262
that Discovery Channel shit
past my boy.

87
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:33,132
âªâª

88
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:37,402
Come on.
You do this for two months,

89
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,006
you could build a garage
for your Firebird.

90

Loading dock 6.

91
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,878
Come in the south gate.

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Will do.

93
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,748
Thanks, Reggie.

94
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,955
âªâª

95
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,757
What do you think?
What do you wanna do now?

96
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,493
Here?

97

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,054
You get any sleep
last night?

101
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,390
No, I didn't.

102
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:36,128
Were you up all night staring
out the window, Mr. Night Watch?

103
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,796
How's Renn doing?

104
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,132
She alright?

105
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,134
She's handling it.

106
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,804
Alright.
Why don't you get out of here?

107
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,541
Go get some sleep.

108
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,176
Alright?
Yeah.

Yeah.

112
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,560
Cool.

113
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,295
Uh, so you know how I had
something to run by you?

114
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,165
And you said
wait till tomorrow?

115
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,499
No, not really.

116
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,035
Well, I do.

117
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,170
I got a job.

118
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,972
Yeah?
Doing what?

119
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,641
No, man. A<i> job.</i>

120
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,877
For you.
With me.

121
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,982
It's a dentist's office.

122
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,717
Kind of a low-rent dentist,

123
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,320
but he just got in a box
of Dutch Lions.

124
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,189
What the hell
is a Dutch Lion?

125
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,457
Coins, silver.

126
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,325
Each one's worth
a couple hundred bucks.

127
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,194
Yeah, what is a dentist doing
with a bunch of silver coins?

128
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,729
He's a collector
or some shit,

129
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,465
but he keeps them in his office
in a filing cabinet.

130
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,201
Doesn't even have a safe.
And you know this how?

131
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,669
'Cause my cousin
Shawna's roommate

132
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,872
is his dental hygienist.

133
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,074
Your cousin Shawna's
roommate?

134
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,209
Dude,
I already scoped it.

135
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,211
It's a shitty little
cinder-block building

136
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,880
with cheap-ass security.

137
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,615
Child's play
for you, man.

138
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,549
Each coin's worth
a couple hundred bucks.

139
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,820
We're talking 30 or 40 grand
for 15 minutes' work.

140
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,955
What do you plan on doing
with the, uh, dentist?

141
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,024
What, are you gonna
knock him over the head
with his own drill?

142
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,759
Dude, he's on vacation
till tomorrow.

143
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,227
There's no one there.

144
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,432
We hit it today,
get back before happy hour.

145
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:22,167
Come on, man.
You know I work hard here.

146
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,036
You know
I'm a good worker.

147
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,038
But I can do more.

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,673
Let me do more.

149
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,377
Yeah,
you want to do more?

150
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,647
How about you finish
prepping the kitchen?

151
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,186
âªâª

152
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,259
Well?

153
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,628
I got nothing.

154
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,331
Sergeant Noah Dean,
right?

155
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,067
Does his job,
no complaints.

156
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,270
Any personal beefs?

157
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,004
Doesn't seem like
anybody thinks about him

158
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,139
one way or the other.

159
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,674
He's just there.

160
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:05,210
He's got a wife
named...Penny.

161
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,812
Works at
a lawyer's office.

162
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,247
Pretty vanilla.

163
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,350
Are there any problems
with the wife?

164
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,751
Is he cheating
on her or...

165
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,687
No sign of it.

166
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,023
Why you got such a hard-on
for this guy?

167
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,300
Let me know
if you want more info.

168
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:31,103
Should be easy to track.
He just got his PCS orders.

169
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,505
PCS orders?

170
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,374
Permanent Change of Station.
His unit's rotating out.

171
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,276
Dude's coming home.

172
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:49,188
âªâª

173
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,793
âªâª

174
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,070
Okay.
We're gonna go and...

175
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,672
No.

176
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,208
Hey.

177
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,609
Hey.
Hey, bud.

178
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,810
I thought you were
going to the gym.

179
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,681
Yeah, I was, but I, uh...
changed my mind.

180
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,817
I wanted to come hang out
with you two.

181
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,153
Oh, that's sweet.

182
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,888
You should put some ice
on that bruising.

183
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,624
Yeah, my abuela
gave me worse.

184
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,626
God damn it.

185
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,530
Hey, hey, let me...
let me... let me do it.

186
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,771
Alright.

187
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,639
Get these pants up.

188
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,107
Wow.

189
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,576
Hey.

190
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,444
Hmm?

191
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:46,812
We're gonna be fine.

192
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,349
Yeah, I know.

193
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,388
Want to go for a walk
or something later?

194
00:10:57,192 --> 00:11:02,061
Yeah, I was gonna take, uh,
Nick to the zoo.

195
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,197
Oh, okay.

196
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,003
Well, he loves
the merry-go-round.

197
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,671
Don't you, bud?

198
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,939
Yeah.

199
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,074
Here you go.

200
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:23,949
âªâª

201
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,452
You can come with us,
if you'd like.

202
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,891
Yeah, I'd like that.

203
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,964
The ice maker
broke again.

204
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,967
I'll go grab some bags of ice
from the grocery store.

205
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,771
Here's last night's
receipts.

206
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:46,639
Where is it?

207
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,710
Dentist's office,
where is it?

208
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,045
El Centro.

209
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,447
Street to street?

210
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:55,981
Is there an alleyway?

211
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,316
Yep, alley.

212
00:11:58,453 --> 00:11:59,852
Neighbors?

213
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,922
Uh, laundromat and a Goodwill
across the street.

214
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,526
What exactly would you
need<i> me</i> to do?

215
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,862
Just let me ride
with you.

216
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,464
Show me how to do it.

217
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,936
Yeah, alright.
That's fine.

218
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:19,872
Seriously?

219
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:20,940
Yeah.

220
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,809
Alright, thanks.
I got a piece out in my car.

221
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,811
No, you're not
gonna need it.

222
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,348
You get the wrong info,
we get caught, you know,

223
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,685
carrying a gun makes
the charges a lot worse.

224
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,219
Right.
Got it.

225
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:38,757
We're gonna need a third,
so I'm gonna call J.

226
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,493
Alright.

227
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,094
Okay.

228
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:50,836
âªâª

229
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:59,312
âªâª

230
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:08,287
âªâª

231
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:23,135
Hey.
Hey.

232
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,737
How's your arm?

233
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:25,972
It's okay.

234
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,209
Been back to my house?

235
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,812
No. No, I wouldn't go
when you're not there.

236
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,187
I met your mom
yesterday.

237
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:43,689
My mom?

238
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,825
Yes, nice lady,
dark hair.

239
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,494
She looks like you.

240
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,030
If she's in town,

241
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:54,099
she's probably having
boyfriend troubles again.

242
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,370
Yeah, she was worried.

243
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:00,439
She's looking for you.

244
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah.

245
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,442
She's like that.

246
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,111
Yeah.

247
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,985
What's she do for a living,
your mom?

248
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,725
She runs a...
a dog-grooming business.

249
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:24,529
Aah!

250
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,598
Who is she?!

251
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,865
I don't know!

252
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,601
Aah! Aah!

253
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,503
She's a cop!
She's a cop!

254
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,073
A cop!
I mean, okay, she...
I don't know.

255
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,608
She's a cop?!
I'm on probation!

256
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,142
She just...
She can violate me!

257
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,078
What department is she with?
I don't know, I swear.

258
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,814
It's... It's not Oceanside
is all I know!

259
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,682
What does she want?
Info.

260
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:44,884
What kind of info?
On you!

261
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,219
What kind of info?!

262
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,954
S-She wanted to know
how to get inside your house!

263
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,889
Aah!
And you helped her?!

264
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,357
I swear, please!
Please!

265
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,160
I can't get rid of this bitch!
I can't!

266
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,763
Okay, she doesn't do shit
the normal cop way!

267
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,565
Is she dirty?
I don't... I don't know.
She's just scary.

268
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,301
If she doesn't live in
Oceanside, where's she staying?

269
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,970
I don't know, I don't know.
I'm sorry, man.

270
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,239
Please, please.

271
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,810
You call her, you tell her
you want to meet.

272
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,180
What's up?

273
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,316
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- No problem.

274
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,584
I wanted to talk to you
about something, actually.

275
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,255
Uh, it's one of your buildings,
the eight-unit.

276
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:24,590
I think we should take it
off the market.

277
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,659
What? I thought you said
we needed to sell them all?

278
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,795
Yeah, but if we have too many
multi-family properties

279
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:30,930
on the market at one time,

280
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,132
it's gonna drive
all the prices down.

281
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay. Yeah, fine.
That's fine.

282
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,402
Good. Um...

283
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:41,073
So, what'd you want
to talk about?

284
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,009
Tommy's got a job for us.

285
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,882
It's got to happen today.
Mark's out of town.

286
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,250
We need a third.

287
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,559
You just walked out of a mansion
with $300,000 in diamonds,

288
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,227
and now you want to roll
with your barback?

289
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,030
What the hell
is wrong with you?

290
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,501
It's gonna be the easiest job
we've ever pulled,

291
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:12,305
and... and we need to start
developing people, okay?

292
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,239
We need to have a network.
Smurf had a network, right?

293
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,975
How much are you
telling this guy?

294
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,977
Nothing he can't handle.

295
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,644
Look,
if we do this for him,

296
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,114
he's grateful,
which means he's loyal.

297
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:25,250
That's what we need.
We need loyal people.

298
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,987
It's like minor-league
smash-and-grab shit.

299
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,388
It's fun.

300
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,857
I kind of feel like having
some fun, don't you?

301
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:39,464
âªâª

302
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,067
Reverse.

303
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,938
Oh, what?
That's impossible.

304
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
Look at the card,
Barry.

305
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,875
Oh.
You did not
just call me Barry.

306
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:51,944
You didn't draw four,
so...

307
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,479
hop to it.

308
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,416
Oh, you two are
ganging up on me.

309
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:00,086
I'm gonna report this
to the Uno police.

310
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:05,490
Hey, baby,
I need your help.

311
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,292
Me? Why?

312
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:10,763
'Cause you got
a steady hand.

313
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,432
And attention to detail.

314
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,500
Come on.

315
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,036
Yeah. Go.

316
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,304
It's good what
she's teaching you.

317
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,808
And when you're done, we'll,
uh... we'll all catch a movie.

318
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,045
Okay.

319
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,993
Here we go, man,
back home.

320
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,062
Had a good time at
the monkey house, didn't we?

321
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,198
Alright, I'm gonna put him down
for his nap.

322
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,068
Right, buddy?

323
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:06,819
âªâª

324
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:10,756
Hey.
You alright?

325
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,157
Hey.

326
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,960
Relax, you're home.

327
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,295
Alright?

328
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:25,504
âªâª

329
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:34,513
âªâª

330
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:43,722
âªâª

331
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:52,998
âªâª

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,467
Come on.

333
00:18:54,469 --> 00:19:02,675
âªâª

334
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:11,083
âªâª

335
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:19,292
âªâª

336
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:22,161
Why can't you
just buy bullets?

337
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:23,762
These ones
are different.

338
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:28,301
They crumble on impact,
so they're not traceable.

339
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:31,604
You have to protect yourself,
Andrew, protect your family.

340
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,246
Not too much.

341
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,515
How many grains?
I don't know.

342
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,783
You just gotta know,
you know?

343
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,785
You should have a scale,
a digital one.

344
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,988
This is all guesswork.

345
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,656
Put it on the press.

346
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,533
How many of these
do we have to do?

347
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,202
About a hundred.
That'll take forever.

348
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:05,705
Yeah, it will if you
don't stop complaining.

349
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,079
Alright. 50.

350
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,551
I want to go
to the movies.

351
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,759
Alright. Go.

352
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:33,498
âªâª

353
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,173
âªâª

354
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:12,605
âªâª

355
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:22,681
âªâª

356
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:28,621
âªâª

357
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,822
Oh, shit.

358
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:33,426
Oh! I-I thought...
I thought you were with Smurf.

359
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,227
Hey, so it's okay.

360
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:36,429
Andrew, it's okay.

361
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:39,231
He'll be fine.
Julia.

362
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,167
Andrew, wait, wait, wait!
Please, wait!

363
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,637
Wait!

364
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,171
What happened?
What happened?

365
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,173
Wait. Just take a deep breath.
What's wrong with him?

366
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,241
Smurf, shut up!

367
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,176
Andrew, I'm sorry!

368
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,245
No, Andrew, wait!

369
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:54,680
Stop!

370
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,716
Oh, shit.

371
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:02,988
âªâª

372
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,160
âªâª

373
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,766
Shit, shit, shit.
Just give him some time.
He'll be okay.

374
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,636
It's not that simple.
You don't know him.

375
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:18,370
I know him just fine.

376
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:19,771
If you stop treating him
like a baby,

377
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,308
he'll stop acting
like a baby.
Shit.

378
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,576
He's gonna walk around
and come back home,

379
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,345
and then
we'll talk to him.

380
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,582
Okay, fine.
Hey, I'll come with you.

381
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:33,853
No! God, he's my brother,
not yours!

382
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:37,857
âªâª

383
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,591
Make sure it's on.

384
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:46,732
âªâª

385
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,203
What's up, Pope?

386
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,439
I'm in the middle
of a rebuild.

387
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:58,678
Christ sakes.

388
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,451
How can I help you
today?

389
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,357
You can't take
my truck, dude.
I'm not taking it.

390
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,793
It's my livelihood.
I want to hire you.

391
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,965
Not sure I want
to be hired.

392
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,767
What do you want?

393
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,504
I want your help getting
some info on someone.

394
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:28,708
Get one of your brothers
to do it.

395
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,776
I want<i> you</i> to do it.

396
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,650
Okay.

397
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,119
Great.

398
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,754
I'm gonna need
that wrench.

399
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,226
Well, God damn.

400
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,130
It's been a while.
Mm.

401
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:54,066
Forget what it was like?

402
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,602
No.

403
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,271
No, I didn't.

404
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:10,850
Sleep.

405
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:56,462
âªâª

406
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,130
Just needed
to clear my head.

407
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:04,269
âªâª

408
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,571
Give me some.

409
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,274
Are you sure?

410
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:11,143
Mm-hmm.
Pack it up.

411
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:18,818
âªâª

412
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,229
âªâª

413
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:35,301
âªâª

414
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:37,169
Definitely looks empty.

415
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:42,107
âªâª

416
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,277
You ready?
Yeah.

417
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,847
You plan on leaving fingerprints
everywhere?

418
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,649
Oh, shit.

419
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:53,385
I'm throwing some gloves
under the seat.

420
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,521
- Sorry.
- No, it's alright.

421
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,356
Okay to be
a little nervous.

422
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,194
Alright.
Let's do it.

423
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,129
10 minutes,
in and out.

424
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:13,939
âªâª

425
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,675
We could bust out
the lock cylinder.

426
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,677
No, just use the window.

427
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,945
- Yeah, okay.
- Go check it out.

428
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,548
Me?
Yeah, you.
Go check it out.

429
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,218
There any, uh, motion sensors
or window detectors?

430
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,486
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I see one.

431
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,288
What's the brand?

432
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,556
Uh, TrigShield.

433
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,693
Okay, good.
They suck.

434
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,427
Window first,
then the wires.

435
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:43,302
âªâª

436

âªâª

438
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,558
Check this shit out.

439
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:09,461
For "Distinguished
Service."

440
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:12,798
This is just, like,
medical records.

441
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,735
There ain't shit in here.
Let's try the lobby.

442
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:22,874
âªâª

443
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:25,811
Hey.

444
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:28,480
Now, this is what
I'm talking about, baby.

445
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,083
Oh, sweet.

446
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:33,352
Nice. Oh.

447
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,487
Guess this is what
Dutch Lions are.

448
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,889
Guess Tommy's cousin's roommate
wasn't lying.

449
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,625
Hm.

450
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:41,427
Yo, I found them.

451
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:42,962
We got 'em right here.

452
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:45,364
No, I'm looking at it right
here. Give me that hammer.

453
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,699
Dude, this is them.

454
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,900
Well, maybe he has
another box,

455
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:49,902
'cause I'm looking at it
right here.

456
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,303
No, we got what we need.
Let's go.

457
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,371
Hey!
What the hell?!

458
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:53,439
Oh, shit!

459
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,409
Son of a bitch!

460
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:00,179
Ah!

461
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,183
Let's go!

462
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,651
Hey, my sword!

463
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,720
Come on,
come on, come on!

464
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:13,693
Benjamin
on baby daddy.

465
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:19,599
Yeah.

466
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,839
Don't take your hands
off the counter, baby.

467
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,177
Harder. Again.
Double or nothing.

468
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,782
âªâª

469
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,850
Don't let go!

470
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,252
Hey!

471
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,922
You okay?

472
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,924
You're not gonna let him
come in our house like that

473
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,325
and disrespect you.

474
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:48,660
You got this.

475
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:51,997
4 grand in the pot, baby.
Come on, knock him down.

476
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:57,737
Mm.

477
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:01,207
âªâª

478
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:02,341
Yeah!

479
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,009
Shit!
That's my rent money!

480
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,277
Yes!

481
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,946
Don't bet it
if you can't afford it.

482
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,390
I'll grab the baby.

483
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:23,028
We need more beer.

484
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,031
<i>Vamos!</i>

485
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,433
Let's go!

486
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,450
You're so late.

487
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:46,585
Yeah, I had to make sure
I wasn't being followed.

488
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:49,455
You think
he's following you?

489
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,591
I didn't see him, but I want
to go inside to be sure.

490
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:53,125
You're fine.
Just get in.

491
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,862
No, I want to go inside.
I don't have time for that.

492
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,731
Look, I'm hungry.
Could you just...

493
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,333
buy me some food,
please?

494
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,936
No, just get inside
and say what you have to say.

495
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:09,074
âªâª

496
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:13,879
âªâª

497
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,948
You called me.
What do you want?

498
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,885
I need money.

499
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,821
Oh. Really?

500
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:23,755
Yeah, you put me
in a dangerous situation.

501
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,993
Oh, no, you got yourself
in this goddamn situation, kid.

502
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,500
Look, you... I mean,
you got me snitching on
a scary dude here, okay?

503
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:35,635
It's hazardous as shit.

504
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,969
And money's
gonna make it safer?

505
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,437
No, it would make it
worth my time.

506
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,178
Why do you even want this dude?
Don't worry about it.

507
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,047
I sh... I should get
to know what you're doing.

508
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,850
What I'm doing
is keeping you out of jail.

509
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:52,584
You're welcome.

510
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,987
What if I talk
to your boss?

511
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,323
Really?

512
00:30:57,325 --> 00:31:00,526
Listen, you little shithead,
you were already on probation,

513
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,394
and then you were dumb enough
to go selling Vicodins...

514
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:10,936
âªâª

515
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,204
Stay here.

516
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,277
I mean, just like
a hundred a week.

517
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,346
You can afford that.

518
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:22,014
You want to stay
out of jail?

519
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:25,017
So do what I tell you
until I'm done with you.

520
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,620
And you're not getting
any goddamn money.

521
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:35,494
Shit.

522
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:41,033
Ohh. Jesus Christ,
that guy could hit.

523
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,969
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
you've never been arrested,

524
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,305
'cause you left quite a bit
of blood back there.

525
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,708
Get up on the table.

526
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,243
What if I get arrested later?
Can they match me to it?

527
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,779
Don't get arrested.

528
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,047
Pull up your pants leg.

529
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:58,584
Wait.
Let me see the box I grabbed.

530
00:31:58,586 --> 00:31:59,919
There's no way that guy
would've fought so hard

531
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,388
if it's not
something valuable, right?

532
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,956
Let's see.

533
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,065
What?

534
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:16,201
The return address
is a dental lab.

535
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,937
I mean, they are
pretty expensive.

536
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:23,142
Yeah, not every box
is full of treasure, Tommy.

537
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:33,352
That's a big one.

538
00:32:33,354 --> 00:32:35,755
Oh, shit.

539
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,823
Remember, when people
who know what they're doing

540
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,225
tell you what to do,
you listen.

541
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,893
This shit won't happen.

542
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:50,670
You remember this?

543
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,442
Here, you can, uh,
bite down on that.

544
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,313
Wait, wait.
Let me get some of that nitrous.

545
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,514
Nah, you won't need that.

546
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:04,716
Yeah, you want
to remember the pain.

547
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:08,187
Stops you from doing
something stupid again.

548
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,789
Alright.
Do it.

549
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:17,463
Aah! Aah! Aah!

550
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:18,831
Ohh.

551
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:32,344
I don't want to hear it.

552
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,680
She's your sister.

553
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,015
No, Smurf, she's not.

554
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:37,949
You can call it
whatever you want,

555
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:41,420
but in this house,
we're all family.

556
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:44,290
Family doesn't
screw family.

557
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:47,293
Well, then I'll leave.

558
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,828
Where you gonna go?

559
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:52,964
Oh, baby.

560
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,567
You know you're too old
for the orphanage, right?

561
00:33:55,569 --> 00:34:04,576
âªâª

562
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:22,228
God damn it.

563
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,005
Hey.

564
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:35,207
Geez.

565
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:36,408
Trouble?

566
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,810
Yeah, it just started making
this grinding noise

567
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:41,080
and... and
jerking around.

568
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:43,015
You mind?
Please.

569
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:58,698
Alright.

570
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,299
Let's see.

571
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:05,137
Oil's okay, but there's
no transmission fluid.

572
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,843
Tranny's probably shot.

573
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,048
I can take it to my shop,
check it out.

574
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,251
Or you can call
another truck.

575
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,586
No, let's go.

576
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:31,130
You live around here?

577
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:33,332
I can have one of my guys
at the shop run you home

578
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,034
after we do paperwork.

579
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:40,139
No, I'm staying at a motel
down the street.

580
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,607
Okay.

581
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,087
Did you see him
go down?

582
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:57,223
It was like someone
knocked over a fridge.

583
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,825
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he fell on her.

584
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,293
Oh, yeah, Misty?

585
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:02,762
Yeah.
She probably liked it.

586
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:04,163
Yeah.

587
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:05,431
Yeah.

588
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:06,766
Mm.

589
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,901
What do you want?
Uh...

590
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,970
get me a Jack and Coke.
Uh-huh.

591
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,772
Oh, and will you grab me
some beef jerky?

592
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,707
Uh-huh.
Okay.

593
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,048
Heya, bud.

594
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,584
You get some whiplash
from Mom's driving?

595
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,186
Hey!
Get... Get back here!

596
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,188
Start the car!
Start the car!

597
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,722
Get back here!

598
00:36:33,394 --> 00:36:35,060
Let's go! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

599
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,195
Lottery tickets?

600
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,870
Get back here!

601
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:11,297
âªâª

602
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:12,765
Sit down.

603
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:22,775
âªâª

604
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,510
So, how'd you get in?

605
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:29,515
I asked the lady at
the front desk to let me in.

606
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:32,785
Family friend.

607
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,754
How's your transmission?

608
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:37,923
Trashed.

609
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,926
You gotta check
those fluids.

610
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:41,828
Huh?

611
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,132
Why'd you bother
with a tow truck?

612
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:48,066
Wanted to know where I'm
staying, could just follow me.

613
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:53,005
Oh, I was pretty sure you could
pick up a tail, you know?

614
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,807
Considering you're a cop.

615
00:37:54,809 --> 00:38:03,882
âªâª

616
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:06,752
You pretended
to be Taylor's mom.

617
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,620
Yeah.

618
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,889
Why?

619
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:13,225
Doing my job.

620
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,361
And you were
in my house.

621
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,232
Yeah.
My house!

622
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,571
So, how much?

623
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:26,839
What?

624
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,841
How much do you want?

625
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:33,980
âªâª

626
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:35,914
Nothing.
Bullshit.

627
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,383
You're leaning on a snitch,

628
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:40,318
you're creeping
without a warrant.

629
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,056
You were looking
for a payoff.

630
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,124
Parasites.

631
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,995
That's what
cops like you are.

632
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:50,663
But I don't
feed parasites,

633
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,331
because you give them
a little blood,

634
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,534
and they just
keep on sucking.

635
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:59,071
No, no, no, the only way
to deal with parasites,

636
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:03,075
you squeeze the life
out of them!

637
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:06,745
You just squeeze it.

638
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,146
You know what I mean?

639
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:09,882
Who killed
Catherine Belen?

640
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:17,756
You?

641
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:21,027
Baz?

642
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:22,929
Your mother?

643
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:28,967
You want to kill me?

644
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,103
I've already
uploaded my notes.

645
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:33,172
They'll come
right after you.

646
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,177
You want to kill me, Andrew?
Go ahead.

647
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,848
Go kill another woman.

648
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,250
Why not?

649
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,652
They can only
fry you once.

650
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:54,860
âªâª

651
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:56,528
Any luck?

652
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,329
No.

653
00:39:57,331 --> 00:40:00,132
Where'd you look?

654
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:03,269
Park, the strand,
every alley off of Mission.

655
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:13,579
Andrew's asleep
in his bed.

656
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,551
That's what Baz said
he would do.

657
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,888
Hmm.

658
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,091
I wonder
if he'll come back.

659
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,892
What's that mean?

660
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,361
Baz took off.

661
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,429
Why?

662
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:35,233
Boys...

663
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,036
Such an asshole.

664
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:42,708
He's had it a lot harder
than you.

665
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:49,181
Do you even remember
living in the motel?

666
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:52,451
You remember
living in the trailer?
Yes.

667
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:57,255
Do you know
how hard I've worked

668
00:40:57,257 --> 00:41:00,859
for us to have
a decent home?

669
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:04,330
To create this family?

670
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:09,702
For you to just ruin it.

671
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,339
What the hell
did you just say?

672
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:19,745
Andrew told me
about you and Baz.

673
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:22,681
It's... It's...

674
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:24,817
It's... It's not
even like that.

675
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:28,154
It's not just sex.
Baz, he... he actually loves me.

676
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:34,160
So now you think
you're a woman?

677
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:39,097
'Cause you know how to make
a teenage boy hard?

678
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:43,169
Baby, it is not
rocket science.

679
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,638
He'd stick it
in a snotty Kleenex

680
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,175
if he thought
it was still wet.

681
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:52,044
That's just reality,
little girl.

682
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:56,515
You better
get used to it.

683
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:04,657
âªâª

684
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:15,067
âªâª

685
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,336
Where... Where am I?

686
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,208
My apartment.

687
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:26,345
And who are you?

688
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:27,613
Ginger.

689
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,416
Ginger, okay.

690
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:33,151
Well, Ginger,
where's Renn?

691
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:35,954
Your girlfriend?

692
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,089
She went out to score.

693
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:39,525
God damn it.

694
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:44,697
You seen my phone?

695
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:49,435
Ginger, my phone,
have you seen it?

696
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:50,502
Hey, do you mind?

697
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,571
Oh, God damn it.

698
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,040
Change your baby.

699
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:57,976
Alright, buddy, I'm coming.
Hold on a sec.

700
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:01,047
Seen his, um... his diaper bag?

701
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:05,317
You know, his dia... diaper bag
anywhere, phone, something?

702
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:10,256
Look, can you just...

703
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:13,259
You have
any paper towels or...

704
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:16,128
anything I can use?

705
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,396
Please?

706
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:24,070
Alright, buddy,
let's get you out of here.

707
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:26,072
Come here.
I got you.

708
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:27,139
Sorry.

709
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,541
There you go.

710
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:31,878
There you are.

711
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,279
Hey.

712
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:36,882
You okay?

713
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,150
I know.

714
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:41,287
Ahhh.

715
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:42,622
It's alright.

716
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,560
Silver coins,
you got a little sword.

717
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:50,829
It's like we're a bunch
of goddamn pirates.

718
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:53,432
Mm. Mm.

719
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:54,767
Pirates with dentures.

720
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,901
Yeah.

721
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,639
Hit it.

722
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,775
Oh, you should be giving Tommy
some of that.

723
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:04,110
No.

724
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:07,579
He's gotta learn that there are
repercussions for his actions.

725
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:10,048
Yeah. I mean, his ego's
gonna take a while.

726
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,586
Got his ass kicked
by a goddamn dentist.

727
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:17,523
That's why you don't start
on old people, huh, Pope?

728
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:20,693
They'll beat the shit
out of you.

729
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:25,063
You alright?

730
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:30,736
âªâª

731
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:36,208
âªâª

732
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,377
A cop
has been tailing me.

733
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:43,382
Since when?

734
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:48,521
I don't know.

735
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:54,893
And?

736
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:57,463
Oh. Shit.

737
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:01,567
She knows.

738
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:05,338
She knows what?

739
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:10,509
I killed Cath.

740
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:16,048
âªâª

741
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,250
I did it for Smurf.
