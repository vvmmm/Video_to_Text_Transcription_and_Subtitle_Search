RECRUITING SERVANTS FOR SONGRIM

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,498
That is not a letter.

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,750
What is there to a letter?

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,843
As long as it delivers your feelings.

6
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,049
You must have pitied me
for trying to get in here

7
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,394
as a servant.

8
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,350
You used to be
an incredibly experienced master.

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,193
I did feel bad for you.

10
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,606
I guess I helped you learn
about loyalty and duties.

11
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,858
Seeing how far you would go as my master,

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,190
I did think that I should do my best.

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,856
You must have felt pressured.

14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,657
Not really. But I was in a dilemma.

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:21,293
I did not know if I should reply
as your young master or pupil.

16
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,543
Or just reply based on what I read.

17
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,338
What did you read?

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,969
Then should I also reply
based on what I read?

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,008
Also? What do you mean?

20
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,264
It is written here.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,767
I will go this far just to see you.

22
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,651
"I can do anything
if it means being able to see you."

23
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,812
And this is my reply.

24
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,577
I also missed you.

25
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,785
That is my reply.

26
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,243
I will pretend like I did not hear that.

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,284
You should forget about the letter too.

28
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,963
You cannot get rid of something

29
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,499
that has already been exchanged.

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,342
It is as good as gone.

31
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,627
Once it burns away,

32
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,677
there will be nothing left.

33
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,223
So you think burning it
will make it disappear?

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,390
But know this, Master.

35
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,482
Your pupil

36
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,767
has recently learned to read
what cannot be seen.

37
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,485
I told you that I read Words of the Heart.
Do you want to check?

38
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,321
You must focus

39
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,326
when you are trying to read
what you cannot see.

40
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,832
And thenâ¦

41
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,326
call out the name of the receiver.

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,998
Mu-deok.

43
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,674
This is a clear and dangerous signal.

44
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,295
I am in love with this man.

45
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,968
There. I read you.

46
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,847
Some things are hard to see
because they are hidden,

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,057
not because they do not exist.

48
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,198
Just as you saw my blue mark
and found out I was a soul shifter,

49
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,372
you have once again caught me.

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,163
You have found another weakness of mine.

51
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,115
If you must call that a weakness,

52
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,327
then it is my weakness too.

53
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,706
You sent me a letter,
and I sent you a reply.

54
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,455
So we both share that weakness.

55
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,258
I guess I would not mind
having you share a weakness.

56
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,182
Honestly, I felt anxious
while we were apart.

57
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,888
You finally had what you always wanted,

58
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,688
and I had no power to do anything
even if you chose to betray me.

59
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,936
I even thought to myself that
I should have poisoned you

60
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,776
and found something to blackmail you with.

61
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,316
But Uk,

62
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,290
it seems you have
already poisoned yourself.

63
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,001
Poison?

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,209
You will become weak and miserable.

65
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,247
It is a terrible poison you cannot escape,

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,340
as its only antidote is
the person it is from.

67
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,011
Are you saying
the reason I missed you so much

68
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,552
was that I was poisoned?

69
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,548
Yes.

70
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,638
You were cruelly poisoned
by a dangerous assassin.

71
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,595
Think of it as that.

72
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,346
And it is not far from the truth.

73
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,057
So I was poisoned?

74
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,438
Then again, I did find it bizarre
that the person I missed

75
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,859
was you of all people.

76
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,276
You always threaten to kill me.

77
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,155
You even once threw a knife at me.

78
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,622
You mocked my incompetence
and even made my arm rot.

79
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,413
Yet you had the audacity to lie.

80
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,747
You were always so horrible to me,

81
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,002
but I could not get you out of my head.

82
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,964
I miss you first thing in the morning,

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,545
all throughout the day,
and even when I lie down to go to sleep.

84
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,011
-Stop.
-Why should I stop?

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,471
I confessed my feelings,
and you ruined it with poison.

86
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,432
So you should at least know my symptoms.

87
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,023
You said you were my antidote.

88
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,979
All I did was sincerely tell you
that I missed you, you wicked assassin.

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,563
You called it poison.

90
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,187
So from now on,
I will complain to you about my symptoms.

91
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,565
After all, I was poisoned.

92
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,031
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

93
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,912
You called yourself an antidote,
so you deal with this toxin.

94
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,263
This young master is
the nephew of Songrim's leader

95
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,550
and the future leader of our organization.

96
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,733
I have come to greet you
on behalf of the leader.

97
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,599
Congratulations on
becoming a Songrim member.

98
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,688
Welcome.

99
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,363
You all did a great job today.

100
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,744
Tonight, you will be served
a generous amount of alcohol and meat.

101
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,872
So relax and have fun.

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,708
Go get yourselves a drink.

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,542
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,341
Young Master.

105
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,341
Are you acquainted with Mu-deok,

106
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,263
the servant who passed the exam today?

107
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,263
I am talking about the maid
who came in last.

108
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,016
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE

109
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,521
SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST

110
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,788
Number 125, Mu-deok.

111
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,544
You have passed!

112
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,545
Yes, I am very well-acquainted
with Mu-deok.

113
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,354
She fainted due to exhaustion
and got taken to Sejukwon.

114
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,889
I need to return
the bag she brought to the contest

115
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,851
along with this entrance plaque.

116
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,517
Is she still at Sejukwon?

117
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,403
Give it to me. I will give it to her.

118
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,821
You did great today.

119
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,197
All right. Let us go.

120
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,186
Mu-deok.

121
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,964
The reason you get lost
when you have a lot on your mind

122
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,463
is that you are focused
on too many things.

123
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,170
When that happens,
just try to focus on one thing.

124
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,681
So the only one in your mind
has been Jang Uk, Naksu.

125
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,243
Hey, Yul.

126
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,830
I happened to look inside Mu-deok's bag,

127
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,196
and I found something strange in here.

128
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,749
Is this not the whistle
you used to carry around?

129
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,298
The one you left at Danhyanggok.

130
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,379
Yes, that is mine.

131
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,553
Then why does Mu-deok have it?

132
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,068
Have you seen Young Master Park?

133
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,241
He apparently has my bag
and entrance plaque.

134
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,330
He gave them to me.

135
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,738
I see.

136
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,698
I will take that.

137
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,800
I left this at Danhyanggok.
Is that where you got this?

138
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,047
Yes.

139
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,474
I kept it becauseâ¦

140
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,477
Because you are in love with me.

141
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,777
You told me that you were in love with me.

142
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,487
That is enough of an explanation.

143
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,499
I will just take my things.

144
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,541
You can keep the whistle.

145
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,211
I already told Dang-gu
that I gave it to you.

146
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,968
So I cannot take it back.

147
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,264
Why are you giving this to me?

148
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,926
You did not believe me
when I said I was in love with you.

149
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,637
Then do a better job
and make me believe it.

150
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,323
Up until now, I was just teasing them.

151
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,616
But Mu-deok is actually in love with Yul.

152
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,201
And seeing how Yul gave her that,

153
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,786
I am guessing
he has some feelings as well.

154
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,826
She probably asked him for the whistle.

155
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,918
When she needs something,

156
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,002
she easily flatters people and lies.

157
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,719
Yul even knew about Mu-deok's test.

158
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,301
He solved all the test questions for her.

159
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,427
She probably asked Yul
to help her out beforehand

160
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,675
because she was so desperate to pass.

161
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,443
She always gets what she wants.

162
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,809
Most importantly,

163
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,361
I saw them
affectionately spending time together.

164
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,146
What?

165
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,195
Affectionately?

166
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,037
Mu-deok and Yul met up
with each other separately.

167
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,094
I guess you did not know because you were
locked up in the Training Center.

168
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,588
Gosh.

169
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,008
No, I had no idea.

170
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,750
What if it is true?

171
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,461
I also missed you.

172
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,670
That is my reply.

173
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,345
She turned me down
because she did not like me.

174
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,175
She did not miss me like I did.

175
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,056
I was the only one who felt that way.

176
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,107
Iâ¦

177
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,355
I should just poison myself and die.

178
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,712
This is so embarrassing.

179
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,892
I am indeed in love with you.

180
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,345
I can tell you that
hundreds and thousands of times.

181
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,359
I do not know much about love,

182
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,027
but when you truly love someone,
you will not need to say it that often.

183
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,119
Because it will be hard
just to say it once.

184
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,082
That whistle used to belong

185
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,038
to a friend I once failed
to confess my feelings for.

186
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,047
I liked you a lot.

187
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,613
I have always wanted to tell her that.

188
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,700
I would also like to try.

189
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,446
Can I have that?

190
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,700
We will be seeing each other often
now that you are back in Songrim.

191
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,655
You may come to me if you need any help.

192
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,455
Thank you.

193
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,160
Uk managed to read Words of the Heart.

194
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,039
Master, you helped him, did you not?

195
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,383
I figured you might want to know,
so I came to inform you.

196
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,551
Tell Jin to take that book
and hand it over to Jinyowon.

197
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,051
There is a bone here.

198
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,630
Why?

199
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Uk got angry at the fact that
everyone was reading it.

200
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,977
I think Master Seo Gyeong
would have felt the same way.

201
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,269
It seems like you are very fond of Uk.

202
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,817
He is a special young man,
so I have my eyes on him.

203
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,860
He is a clever fellow,

204
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,364
but Jin just wants to keep him locked up.

205
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,991
Are you sure

206
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,789
the ice stone is not somewhere in Songrim?

207
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,539
What makes you think that?

208
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,672
Twenty years ago,

209
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,047
Gwanju Jang Gang
performed the alchemy of souls.

210
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,297
Because of that,

211
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,013
a child that
should not have been born was born.

212
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,472
And that night,
the King's Star was in the night sky.

213
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,266
Is that child Jang Uk?

214
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,232
Yes.

215
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,692
A mage at Songrim unsealed the ice stone

216
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,612
and birthed the king's son
through the alchemy of souls.

217
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,834
And Jin Mu at Cheonbugwan knows this fact.

218
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,173
If the ice stone has
already fallen into their hands,

219
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,042
what kind of justification
can Songrim useâ¦

220
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,840
to take that stone from them?

221
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,389
Jin has no choice but to hide Uk
because he wishes to protect Songrim.

222
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:20,887
Why?

223
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,734
Is there something I do not know about?

224
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,239
You littleâ¦

225
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,452
How am I supposed to say anything
to such a careless and imprudent punk?

226
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,584
How could youâ¦

227
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,624
I hope I can wash this off.

228
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,422
Heâ¦

229
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,804
He is angrier than he was
when I told him I decided

230
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,511
to stop training with chaste herbs.

231
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,934
Wait. He got that scarf
from Maidservant Kim.

232
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,949
I am sorry.

233
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,202
We must finish cleaning

234
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,618
before the mages begin their day,
so move quickly.

235
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,537
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

236
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,935
Where is Young Master Jang?

237
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,072
-Is he not here?
-Wellâ¦

238
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,399
I went to wake him up,

239
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,743
but he told me
he did not sleep a wink last night.

240
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,069
So he did not wake up? On his first day?

241
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,157
See you later, Mu-deok.

242
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,006
Young Master.

243
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
You must wake up.

244
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,433
Young Master!

245
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,523
Get up.

246
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,023
Or else I will beat you.

247
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,274
Wake up!

248
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,831
Stop being annoying and go.
I am going to sleep.

249
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,663
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have a death wish?

250
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,035
Yes, I would rather die.

251
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,752
What is the matter with you?

252
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,377
This is just a symptom.
I have been poisoned.

253
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,676
Uk, stop being stubborn with your spite.

254
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,718
I told you I was your antidote.

255
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,055
Here.

256
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,103
Here is your antidote.

257
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,833
I am sorry.

258
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,338
Hey, Uk.

259
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,090
I heard you read Words of the Heart.
I am impressed.

260
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,847
It is nothing to be impressed about.

261
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,269
I see you are reading about
the Hyeongong Technique.

262
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,558
I mastered that swordsmanship
when I was little.

263
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,015
If you teach me how to read
Words of the Heart,

264
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,814
I will teach you the Hyeongong Technique.

265
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,355
I am not sure.

266
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,065
Do it. Tell him you will do it.

267
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,161
Listen. I am a bit tired.

268
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,503
You can ask Master Lee
how to read Words of the Heart.

269
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,380
Uk.

270
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,551
I mastered Ryusu
around the same time you did.

271
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,058
So what do you say we fight a duel?

272
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,429
Then I will lend you
a precious sapphire mat

273
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,476
that I use for training.

274
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,229
If you train with that,
it will double your energy.

275
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,614
A sapphire mat?
That is very hard to come by.

276
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,897
Young Master, this is great.

277
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,579
But sapphire mats are really cold,
are they not?

278
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,287
I easily get cold these days.

279
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,410
So I do not need something like that.

280
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,837
What are you doing?

281
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,847
I have not been sleeping well these days,
so I am going to take a nap.

282
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,727
You missed your chance
to learn the Hyeongong Technique.

283
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,809
Are you mad?

284
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,653
The same goes for yesterday.
Sapphire mats are so rare,

285
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,149
but you refused, saying it was cold.

286
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,781
You should have said yes
even if you were to die on that mat.

287
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,488
You are unbelievable.
"You are mad. Just die."

288
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,399
That is all you ever say to me.

289
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,701
Just give me that.

290
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,745
What are you doing?

291
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,376
There is no space to nap together.

292
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,126
You must get through me to take a nap.

293
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,972
Move.

294
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,224
Make me.

295
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,175
It will not take too much effort.

296
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,939
Damn it.

297
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,071
I told you I missed you,

298
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,738
but you told me I was poisoned.
I need to sleep to recover from the shock,

299
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,828
so stop pushing me
and stay away for a bit.

300
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,629
You just want to make me feel frustrated.

301
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,085
Like I said, if I die, you die.

302
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,643
I am in agony,
so you should at least feel irritated.

303
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,889
I even have convulsions
when I sleep these days.

304
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,813
For how long, then?

305
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,863
I do not know.

306
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,112
Why? Does it frustrate you?

307
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,395
That will help me sleep well.

308
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,541
Young Master Jang will not stop sleeping.

309
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,085
You should beat him up and make him train.

310
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,049
The mages of Jeongjingak train
on their own accord.

311
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,219
How fast one masters one's energy
all depends on the individual.

312
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,679
I will not interfere
as long as he sticks to the rules.

313
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,014
Butâ¦

314
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,465
Do not worry. There he is.

315
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,064
Hello.

316
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,149
My head hurts so much.

317
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,522
I would like to go home

318
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,108
and recuperate by taking a bath.

319
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,661
Why does your heart hurt?
You have not done a thing.

320
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,241
You cannot go home on your own accord.
That is against the rules.

321
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,407
Is it not?

322
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,155
Uk is an exception.
The leader gave him permission.

323
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,708
Why only him?

324
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,791
You may have been too busy
having fun to know about this,

325
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,797
but I made a deal with the leader
while I was locked in here.

326
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,591
I will be back.

327
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,595
I will go with him.

328
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,978
If you go, you will be fired.

329
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,360
You went through a lot to get hired.
Are you okay with getting fired?

330
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,654
Damn it.

331
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,081
Jang Uk went home.

332
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,659
Are you sure that is okay?

333
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,084
Let him do whatever he wants

334
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,501
so he can remain lazy.

335
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:27,997
My lord.

336
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,465
Lady Jin is asking you
to wait a little longer.

337
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,222
Is she with another guest?

338
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,154
I saw a servant from Cheonbugwan
on our way inside.

339
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,320
By any chance, do you think
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu is here?

340
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,990
They are not close enough
to personally meet up like this.

341
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,656
Just in case, go see if anyone leaves.

342
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,457
If that is what Master Lee wants,

343
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,587
we will store Words of the Heart
safely in Jinyowon.

344
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,314
Were you meeting someone else before me?

345
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,641
A distant relative.

346
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,059
Is Young Lady Jin going to be
the official heir of Jinyowon?

347
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,526
That has not been decided yet.

348
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,821
My eldest daughter might still be alive.

349
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,241
It has been ten years since the accident.

350
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,371
Although she could not see,

351
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,423
she could feel energy
and could control relics like no other.

352
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,209
She was a very clever girl.

353
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,712
Unlike other babies,

354
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,918
it took her 13 months
to come out into this world.

355
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,926
She was born on the very day
that Gwanju Jang Gang picked

356
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,471
as a blessed day from the skies.

357
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,483
She was born exactly on the day
that Jang Gang picked for you?

358
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,107
Is it possible

359
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,228
to choose the date and time
of a baby's birth?

360
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,900
It just happened to match.

361
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,911
I would like to invite Master Lee
to Jinyowon someday.

362
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,792
Please tell him that.

363
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,116
I will.

364
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,926
I had her inside me for 13 months.

365
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,063
I cannot let her go like this.

366
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,555
I heard the ice stone has the power

367
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,565
to bring back the souls of the dead.

368
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,316
Gwanju.

369
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,576
Please help me.

370
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:19,508
I went far and beyond to protect my baby.

371
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,102
I will find you.

372
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,692
I will do everything I can

373
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,856
to find you.

374
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,830
-Did you check who the previous guest was?
-Yes.

375
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,837
It was Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.

376
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,295
Since when did the leader of Jinyowon

377
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,635
acknowledge him as a family member
and meet with him like this?

378
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,562
He quietly left through the back gate.

379
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,018
They must have made a secret deal.

380
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,897
I wonder what that cunning man, Jin Mu,

381
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,941
is using as bait
to freely enter Jinyowon like this.

382
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,673
There is no way to find out where you are
since you cannot see.

383
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,798
If you do as you are told
and stay completely silent,

384
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,925
your life will be spared.

385
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,394
Do not make any noise.

386
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,562
Stand up.

387
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,057
Sit down.

388
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,943
Leave that one here. The others can go.

389
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,736
They are looking for the girl
in the portrait.

390
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,321
She must be blind.

391
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,326
He just said the others could leave,
but why is there no movement?

392
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,398
You can see.

393
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,906
What a pity.
I thought I had found an adequate girl.

394
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,367
Kill her.

395
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,874
I can do it!

396
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,327
I can be the girl in the portrait.

397
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,508
Please have mercy.

398
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,887
You said I was adequate.

399
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,965
If you need me to be blindâ¦

400
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,190
then blind I will be.

401
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,003
You are a very daring girl. Stand up.

402
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,087
So you can act like you are blind?

403
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,590
I already am blind.

404
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,604
Let me see if that is true.

405
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,796
It really looks like
I have found an adequate girl.

406
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,865
You will do.

407
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,949
From now on, you are Jin Bu-yeon,
the missing daughter of Jinyowon.

408
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,119
Yes.

409
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,129
I am Jin Bu-yeon.

410
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,313
Uk has stopped once again.

411
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,268
What kind of cliff
do I have to push him off of this time?

412
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,739
I see you are working hard thanks to me.

413
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,120
Yes.

414
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,962
Thanks to you,
I will have to sweep the yard again.

415
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,629
Are you complaining?

416
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,843
Then I will have you gone.

417
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,264
You cheated your way in here.

418
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,931
If I say a word about this,
you will be fired.

419
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,812
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

420
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,982
I am grateful for the leaves
you have sprinkled for me to sweep.

421
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,611
You may keep going your way,
Your Royal Highness.

422
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,069
You should be grateful

423
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,487
for the answer sheet I gave you,
not these leaves.

424
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:45,451
I see you were not being grouchy.
You just wanted to receive credit.

425
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,246
Goodness, I was too slow to notice that.

426
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,251
I am grateful, Your Royal Highness.

427
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,132
Of course, you are grateful.
I solved those questions myself.

428
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,091
Do you even know
how to wash off ink stains?

429
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,597
You solved that question,
Your Royal Highness?

430
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,021
Yes, that is right. I am the Crown Prince.

431
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,598
Yet I learned that rice paste
gets rid of ink stains.

432
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,307
I even tried it myself,
and it actually worked.

433
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,402
Unbelievable.

434
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,113
I am forever indebted to you.

435
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,815
So tell me.

436
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,239
Are you happy to be with your master?

437
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,289
I heard Uk read Words of the Heart.

438
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,499
Yes.

439
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,958
He was the fastest mage
in Jeongjingak to have read it.

440
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,995
I doubt he read it with his skills.

441
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,257
He probably got lucky again.

442
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,088
But still, he beat you in a duel.

443
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,677
Goodness.

444
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,934
I know Uk's level of capacity very well
since I have fought against him.

445
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,099
He has bad swordsmanship,
and his spells are weak.

446
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,897
He got lucky and beat me by using Tansu.
It was not because he was skilled.

447
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,242
He is accurate.

448
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,617
That is why he came to Jeongjingak.
To become a mage of a higher level.

449
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,829
To be frank, he does not even have
what it takes to enter Jeongjingak.

450
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,914
If he manages to beat anyone here,

451
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,285
then I shall acknowledge him.

452
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,634
Using the Crown Prince
would not be such a bad idea.

453
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,803
Your Royal Highness.

454
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,719
Then how about we make a bet?

455
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,722
A bet?

456
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,184
What will I gain
from making a bet with you?

457
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,231
I will bet the most precious thing I own.

458
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,856
I will choose first.

459
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,816
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

460
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,827
Wait there. I will go to you soon.

461
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,878
I also missed you.

462
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,665
That is my reply.

463
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,393
-Young Master.
-Hey.

464
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,095
I brought honey biscuits, your favorite.

465
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,394
Are you also staying for dinner?

466
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,478
No, I am staying here for a few days.

467
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,649
-Is that allowed?
-The leader gave me his permission.

468
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,994
He let me be an exception for everything.

469
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,360
Well, I get why.

470
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,196
It only took you a few days
to read Words of the Heart.

471
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,452
It is absurd to make you abide
by the same rules as ordinary mages.

472
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,905
Are you happy about my achievements?

473
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,827
I am more than happy.

474
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,206
You have no idea how proud I am.

475
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,455
Maidservant Kim.

476
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,176
I know I have always disappointed you,
but you can feel proud now.

477
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,098
Should I get you a nice dress
to help you boast?

478
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,598
My goodness.

479
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,729
I do not wish for anything anymore.
I already feel like I have everything.

480
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,436
These days, people come up to me

481
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,940
and tell me that
you truly are your father's son.

482
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,775
They do?

483
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,650
Your father used to be called a genius,

484
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,237
and they say you are
as talented as your father.

485
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,623
People used to say I was nothing like him.

486
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,628
As you continue to achieve things,

487
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,962
there will be fewer people
who say that about you.

488
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,216
What if I do not do well?
Will they say I am not his son again?

489
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,223
No, that is notâ¦

490
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,644
Tell them to go ahead
and say what they want about me.

491
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,023
I do not care anymore.

492
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,899
Yes, we should not
let that bother us anymore.

493
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,899
Frankly speaking, you are responsible
for your own achievements.

494
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,356
Your father is irrelevant.

495
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,451
He was never around for you anyway.

496
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,702
And to be honest, it is all because

497
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,156
I raised you well.

498
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,011
You will always be
my precious young master

499
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,553
no matter how competent
or incompetent you are.

500
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,051
Really?

501
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,055
Then can I go back
to slacking off like I used to?

502
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,770
Yes, if that is what you want.

503
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,023
But I thought you hated that.

504
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,237
Compared to the times
when you used to slack off at home,

505
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,531
you looked a lot happier
when you had just come back

506
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,163
from your training in Danhyanggok.

507
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,405
That is why I could not stop you
even though it seemed dangerous.

508
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,080
You see,

509
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,415
I want you to achieve
everything you want to achieve.

510
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,179
All right.

511
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,509
I should go back.

512
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,268
You are leaving?

513
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,900
Yes. If you forced me to leave,
then I would have refused to go.

514
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,058
But after that speech,
I should go and study.

515
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,777
I should do everything I can
to make you proud, Maidservant Kim.

516
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,526
How is your headache? Is it better?

517
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,369
Yes.

518
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,241
Horses and people are trained

519
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,576
through the carrot-and-stick approach.

520
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,868
But recently,
I kept getting hit by a stick.

521
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,338
Who in the world dared to hit you?

522
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,879
Do not worry. I am not one
to stay still after getting beaten.

523
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,340
Just pack me some snacks.

524
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,835
A ton of honey biscuits.

525
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,513
-This is going to be fun.
-Are you sure?

526
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,678
Hey, Uk.

527
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,096
You are finally here.

528
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,941
Yes.

529
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,820
Why does it seem like
you have all been waiting for me?

530
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,900
Are you fans of the honey biscuits
I bring from home?

531
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,065
You should go to the Training Center.
It will be fun.

532
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,631
-You have been waiting for me?
-Yes.

533
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,460
I will be your first opponent.

534
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:12,804
What?

535
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,339
Let us fight a duel.

536
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,143
If you refuse, you lose.

537
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,473
What are you talking about?

538
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,096
Just take it.

539
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,723
Uk has lost.

540
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,430
Gu Hyo, the winner,
may take the first gold toad.

541
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,671
What is going on?

542
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,001
I have made a bet.

543
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,376
I never made a bet with you,
Your Royal Highness.

544
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,223
Not with you. I have made a bet
with your maid, Mu-deok.

545
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,523
I told her that you did not
have the skills to beat any of the mages

546
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,968
here at Jeongjingak.

547
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,058
But your maid insisted that
you could at least beat one.

548
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,808
Mu-deok said that, did she?

549
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,114
You will fight a duel every day
for ten days.

550
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,033
If you fail to beat a single fight,

551
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,572
she will give me an item
that is most valuable to her.

552
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,372
Valuable?

553
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,245
What valuable item do you have?

554
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,620
It is something you gave me.

555
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,167
This is what she bet.

556
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,297
This jade looks very valuable,
so I want it for myself.

557
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,305
So I brought gold toads

558
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,982
as prizes for the match.

559
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,450
If you fail to beat a single opponent
before all those toads disappear,

560
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,949
this will be mine.

561
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,833
I am not interested
in taking part in this bet.

562
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,409
This is not a bet between us.
It is a bet I made with her.

563
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,504
If you give up,

564
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,082
you will not have won a single match,
so she will lose.

565
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,090
And this will be mine.

566
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,929
Young Master Jang.

567
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,847
That is the most precious object
I have ever received.

568
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:11,306
Please do your best
so you can win it back.

569
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,486
Look at that.

570
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,744
You really won this gold toad.

571
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,374
Of course. Uk may have managed
to read Words of the Heart,

572
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,793
-but he is a bad swordsman.
-What is going on?

573
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,537
The Crown Prince and Mu-deok
made a bet over Uk.

574
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,844
The Crown Prince brought gold toads,
so everyone is eager to participate.

575
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,177
The strongest mages
are lining up to fight Uk.

576
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,809
Put it down.

577
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,730
The Crown Prince mocked your competence.

578
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,284
As your master, I could not let it slide.

579
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,280
Do not lie to me. I know you.

580
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,241
I have been lazy these past few days,

581
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,704
so you made that senseless bet
to force me to train.

582
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,124
Yes, I did.

583
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,955
You will have to fight ten mages
regardless of your will.

584
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,632
The first duel was
incredibly disappointing.

585
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,338
Your sword was slow,
and your feet were heavy.

586
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,676
-Tomorrow's opponent is from the Jung--
-I am not doing it.

587
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,265
Even if you lose,
you always memorize what you see,

588
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,562
so it will help you learn.

589
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,645
-I told you I am not fighting.
-As you fight ten mages,

590
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,231
you will learn ten different spells.

591
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,568
-Mu-deok--
-Young Master.

592
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,823
Feel free to go home
for a bath again tomorrow.

593
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,195
Then you will never get that jade back.

594
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,914
All right, fine.

595
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,543
So you made this bet.

596
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,122
Butâ¦

597
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,001
But how could you bet on that?

598
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,840
You know why.

599
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,796
That was the only thing
to motivate you to fight hard and win.

600
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,721
When I said I missed you,

601
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,352
is this what you meant
when you said you had my weakness?

602
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,312
Yes.

603
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,475
You probably despise me right now,

604
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,518
but you cannot lose
what we share to someone else.

605
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,621
So this is why you said I was poisoned.

606
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,988
If you get it back,
I will give you a bright smile.

607
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,289
Just like an antidote.

608
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,920
Uk.

609
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,751
Return it to me no matter what.

610
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,207
It is the most precious item
I have ever received

611
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,304
in my entire life.

612
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,562
Is it really precious to you?

613
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,681
Do you not want it back

614
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,642
merely because of its price?

615
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,231
I will get it back from the Crown Prince.

616
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,202
It would be funny to share
that jade with him.

617
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,504
But it was not worth
sharing it with you either.

618
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,982
I heard you have been
visiting Sejukwon pretty often.

619
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,815
Is it because you wish
to appoint Master Heo as your master

620
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,651
and learn spells from him?

621
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,156
Do not be ridiculous.

622
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,736
You are my master.

623
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,576
I am only going there for treatment.

624
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,291
It allows me to get some fresh air.
Not to mention, fun things happen there.

625
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,043
You must enjoy hanging out
with the mages of Songrim.

626
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,297
I get to meet Yul, my cousin.

627
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,549
Park Dang-gu is
a lively person to be around.

628
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,881
As for Jang Uk, I would like
to teach him a lesson, but it is not easy.

629
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,967
He seemed elated
after having read Words of the Heart,

630
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,014
so I put him back in his place today.

631
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,598
He lost to a mage who just mastered Ryusu.

632
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,814
So people know his true competence now.

633
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,604
People no longer admire him.

634
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,951
That is a nice jade.

635
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,815
I got it in exchange for ten gold toads.

636
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,615
-Is it something valuable?
-That blue jade holds yin energy.

637
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,248
Where is the other one?

638
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,370
The other one?

639
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,877
Items with opposite energies
come in pairs.

640
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,209
There should be a red jade
that goes with it.

641
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,092
They are only valuable
when they are together.

642
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,604
So this is supposed to be a pair?

643
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,256
Eunuch Oh.

644
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,596
What does it mean when two people
share something that should be a pair?

645
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,774
It means they are married or a couple.

646
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,690
Damn it.

647
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,356
Do you not like the jade,
Your Royal Highness?

648
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,864
I do not like it. It gets on my nerves.
It extremely bothers me.

649
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,284
Take it away and smash it to pieces.

650
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,997
You cannot do that yet.

651
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,748
Jang Uk might win it back.

652
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,998
If he takes it back,

653
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,297
they will become a pair again.

654
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,883
Damn it.

655
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,345
-Master Lee.
-Yesâ¦

656
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,941
What brings you here?

657
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,987
I wore hemp fabric all year round,
yet I never felt cold.

658
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,663
Butâ¦

659
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,368
after I wore this scarf,

660
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,414
I realized how cold it had been.

661
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,535
What is that over there?

662
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,127
Whatâ¦

663
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,052
My goodness.

664
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,678
I never once thought flowers were pretty,

665
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,887
but I saw these flowers
and wanted to show them to you.

666
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,689
How pretty.

667
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,244
Are they for me?

668
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,002
These booksâ¦

669
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,461
You have nice books here.

670
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,375
What a great read.

671
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,926
About Maidservant Kimâ¦

672
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,182
Is she sick?

673
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,313
I have not seen her at Songrim these days.

674
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,930
She went there yesterday.

675
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,639
She goes there often
to meet Young Master Jang.

676
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,899
I see.

677
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,484
She just did not drop by to see me.

678
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,778
She is with a guest right now.

679
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,664
A guest? Who is it?

680
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,161
I do not know who he is,
but he was a young man.

681
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,373
A young man?

682
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,042
From what I know, Maidservant Kim
is not acquainted with any young men.

683
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,599
Maidservant Kim.

684
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,515
Hello.

685
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,065
What are those weeds?

686
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,938
They are flowers.

687
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,027
-How could you call them weeds?
-Maidservant Kim.

688
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:04,118
Did you get upset that day
because I was a bit harsh?

689
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,408
Is that why you stopped visiting?

690
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,962
I really had no idea.
I thought you were sick.

691
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,079
I came here worried for nothing.

692
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,876
You should not have come.

693
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,592
You said you would never visit again.

694
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,671
When did I ever say that?

695
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,166
You are mistaken.

696
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,182
But still,

697
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,550
I am glad that you are all right.

698
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,595
If you were worried that I might be sick,

699
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,732
you could have brought me
a bundle of weeds like this one.

700
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,647
Do you need weeds?

701
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,356
I will get them for you.

702
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,824
I do not need them.

703
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:49,907
What I want from you are flowers,
not weeds.

704
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,618
I want you to show me

705
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,287
how much you care

706
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,166
by giving me something beautiful.

707
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,048
We still have a guest here,
so you should go.

708
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,472
Maidservant Kim.

709
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,517
Wellâ¦

710
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,400
Next time you come to Songrim to visit Uk,

711
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,740
I hope you will drop by and visit me too.

712
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,489
Waitâ¦

713
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,003
Is she kicking me out

714
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,213
because I came empty-handed?

715
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,075
Maidservant Kim.

716
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,756
What a cold-hearted woman.

717
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,453
Seeing that his shoes
are smaller than mine,

718
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,789
he must be shorter than I am.

719
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,934
Do you like sweet snacks?

720
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,891
Yes, I do.

721
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,387
It is delicious.

722
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,436
Then here is one moreâ¦

723
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,529
For me.

724
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,997
-How do I look?
-You look pretty.

725
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,754
-Try this.
-Me?

726
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,746
How do I look?

727
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,707
-It should go there.
-I see.

728
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,558
Look. There is a flower shop over there.

729
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,281
You said you needed to buy flowers.

730
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,568
I need to buy flowers
to decorate Bu-yeon's room.

731
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,871
We might really find her this time.

732
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,087
Really? Will Jin Mu find her?

733
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,085
It is still a secret.

734
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,426
I really hope Bu-yeon comes back.

735
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,259
Then you will not be able to become
the leader of Jinyowon.

736
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,556
Instead, I will be free
to marry the man I want to marry.

737
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,944
I will be allowed to marry the man I love.

738
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,770
That is good news.

739
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,275
Then we should hurry up
and end our fake engagement.

740
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,742
Thank you for pretending
to be my fake betrothed.

741
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,870
I never pretended.

742
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,793
My feelings

743
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,751
were sincere.

744
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,841
But you are an heir to Songrim.

745
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,723
How could you think of marrying me
and moving in with my family?

746
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,141
I know.

747
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,681
I guess I was worried for nothing.

748
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,135
I was even getting ready

749
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,436
to get kicked out of the family.

750
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,476
Are you serious?

751
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,985
You were willing to give up on
becoming Songrim's heir because of me?

752
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,739
You said you did not want
a loveless marriage.

753
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,619
I figured if I married you,

754
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,829
you would at least marry
a man that loved you.

755
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,541
That is why.

756
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:07,418
Anyway, you should meet a man
that you have feelings for.

757
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,242
I feel like I haveâ¦

758
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,159
already met him.

759
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,957
If you hold onto me like thisâ¦

760
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,585
I will never give up on you.

761
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,433
My feelings for you are too strong.

762
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,640
There is no turning back.

763
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,606
I should get you flowers
to properly propose to you.

764
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,657
Let us go.

765
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:29,583
Send these flowers to the Jang family.

766
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:32,747
Did someone die in the family?

767
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,877
Why are you sending them
white chrysanthemums?

768
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,683
I almost made a huge mistake.

769
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,802
Right.

770
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,274
Everything from here

771
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,891
to all the way over there.

772
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,476
Send them all.

773
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,151
-All these flowers?
-Yes, send them all.

774
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,900
-I am sure she will like at least one.
-Goodness.

775
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,243
My goodness, thank you so much.

776
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,195
-Which one would you like?
-This one.

777
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,038
I can get you everything if you want.

778
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,693
You are the heir of Songrim.

779
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,234
Why would you court
the future leader of Jinyowon?

780
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,822
What was your plan?

781
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,534
Did you plan to give up your succession
and marry into their family?

782
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:43,202
Uncle, we are in love with each other.

783
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,906
Up until recently, Young Lady Jin

784
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,288
had feelings for Uk.

785
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,963
That is wrong. She proved it to me today.

786
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,000
Young Lady Jin said she could give up
becoming the leader of Jinyowon for love.

787
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,586
They only have one daughter.

788
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,211
Who will lead Jinyowon then?

789
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,258
That position is supposed to go
to the eldest daughter.

790
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,802
They are receiving help from Cheonbugwan
to help find her missing sister.

791
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,142
What?

792
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,933
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu
visits them every day for that.

793
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,984
Jin Mu?

794
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,565
I too wish I had another brother

795
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,439
who could take over for me
and become Songrim's heir instead.

796
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,322
This is just a question out of curiosity.

797
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,985
Uncle, is there no chance
that you might have a secret child?

798
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,834
No one?

799
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,629
Not once?

800
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,011
Get out.

801
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,087
I said, get out.

802
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,295
Pardon?

803
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,474
Get out!

804
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,267
It is not too late to have a child now.

805
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,308
Hey.

806
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,231
I mean you are still healthy.

807
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,225
Catch that punk!

808
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,901
Oh, dear.

809
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,170
Why are there so many flowers here?

810
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,173
I tried to cut ties with someone,
and this is how he tries to make up.

811
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:24,263
I hope you forgive him.
The flowers are so pretty.

812
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,547
You speak such kind words.

813
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Young Master Jang's mother

814
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,768
was also kind just like you.

815
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,100
Young Master Jang is kind too.

816
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,315
He is?

817
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:45,072
What makes you think he is kind?

818
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,365
When he talked about his mother,

819
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,200
I could feel the warmth

820
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,445
in his eyes.

821
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,671
What?

822
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,415
He spoke to you about his mother?

823
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,551
You two must be very close.

824
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,626
No, not yet.

825
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,716
He is the one who wishes to become close.

826
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:11,182
Last time,
he kept her busy for four hours.

827
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,216
Is that true?

828
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,233
We just had a chat.

829
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,438
So it really is you. The egret.

830
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,782
Young Master Jang can be blunt
due to his past scars.

831
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,572
But after he opens up to someone,
he is very kind and warm.

832
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,454
I hope you visit often.

833
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,786
Think of this place as your nest.

834
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,292
Feel free to fly in here and visit often.

835
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,670
I will.

836
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,893
Jin Mu is helping Jin Ho-gyeong
find her missing daughter?

837
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,220
It looks like he is
using that as an excuse

838
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,136
to frequently visit Jinyowon.

839
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:59,813
I guess Jin Mu wants Jinyowon on his side.

840
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,645
If Jin Mu gets his hands on Jinyowon,

841
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,192
he will become powerful enough
to fight against Songrim.

842
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,278
Andâ¦

843
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,661
if he no longer fears Songrim,

844
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,210
he and his men will reveal the ice stone
and show it to the world.

845
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,257
Someone on Jin Mu's side
is in possession of the ice stone.

846
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,221
The ice stone may seem like
it is made of ice,

847
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:40,385
but it also has the nature of fire,
water, and wind.

848
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,522
Just as a Choi family mage
did 200 years ago,

849
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:48,401
somebody is using the ice stone's power
to make the Soul Ejector.

850
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,499
This is the new batch of Soul Ejectors
made by the Queen.

851
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,433
It is not the power of the ice stone
that is evil.

852
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:15,639
It is the Soul Ejector
that is being used for evil deeds.

853
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,103
The kind of power
that is not granted to humans

854
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,436
but would be coveted by anyone
if available.

855
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,188
The power to leave the body
you no longer wish to live in

856
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,025
and move to a new one.

857
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:36,079
From an old body to a new one,
an ugly body to a beautiful one.

858
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:41,038
The power to stop death
and live for eternity.

859
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,891
He is a young, healthy,
and beautiful young man.

860
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,484
He has

861
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,653
already been selected to be my successor.

862
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,569
This is where I would like to move into.

863
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,279
Master.

864
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,658
What is the new spell
you promised to show me?

865
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,569
It is the alchemy of souls.

866
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,408
The alchemy of souls?

867
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:24,827
I still have many more things to achieve.

868
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:29,208
But this body is old
and facing death due to sickness.

869
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,553
Which is whyâ¦

870
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,215
I need your body.

871
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,715
What?

872
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,200
Let us begin the alchemy of souls.

873
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,250
Master, I do not wish to switch bodies.

874
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,257
If I enter your body, I will die soon.

875
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,300
But your body will still be alive.

876
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,524
Please help me.

877
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,436
Help me live.

878
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,152
Help! Help me!

879
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,322
Master!

880
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,006
Master.

881
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,015
My bodyâ¦

882
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,939
Give me back my body.

883
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,728
Please. I do not wish to die.

884
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,322
Master! Give me back my body!

885
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,108
Master! I want my body back!

886
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,113
Master!

887
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,871
Once again, the soul of
another valuable mage has been saved

888
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:48,911
by the alchemy of souls.

889
01:10:58,712 --> 01:10:59,922
As long as

890
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,683
we possess the power of the ice stone,

891
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,298
our souls will be able to live forever
instead of dying in this body.

892
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,466
The great power of the ice stone
is currently classified as sorcery,

893
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:13,977
which is why we have no choice
but to lie low like this.

894
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:18,271
But sooner or later, there will come a day
when our power grows strong enough for us

895
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,777
to show everyone that we were right
and that what we wish for is inevitable.

896
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,413
When that day comes,

897
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,121
everyone here

898
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:31,038
will overcome death
and be given eternal life.

899
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,941
Did you witness everything?

900
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,977
Yes.

901
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:04,485
Your job will be to bring someone here.

902
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,828
Jin Ho-gyeong is going to be your mother,
and I want you to win over her heart.

903
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,748
Then bring her to this place.

904
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:16,041
Can you do that?

905
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:20,883
Yes.

906
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,308
You found an adequate match.

907
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,729
If we manage to bring Jin Ho-gyeong here,

908
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:41,019
it will become easier for us
to reveal the ice stone to the world.

909
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,278
My love, why are you still up?

910
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,464
Jin Mu's power and influence

911
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,718
might be stronger
and more widespread than we think.

912
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:57,020
The King's Star must have appeared to deal
with the chaos brought by the ice stone.

913
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,096
Are you talking about Uk?

914
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:05,937
Master Seo Gyeong, who stopped the chaos
brought by the ice stone 200 years ago,

915
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,244
was also born with the energy
of the King's Star.

916
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:10,108
That King's Star
was created through sorcery.

917
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,065
You cannot compare that
to Master Seo Gyeong.

918
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:16,195
They are different.
I did not say they were the same.

919
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,706
That is why I am curious.

920
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,921
I am curious to see if this new star
will slowly fade away

921
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,877
or start shining brightly.

922
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,126
Win!

923
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,673
-Nice.
-Great job.

924
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:12,837
I knew you would win.

925
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,389
I know you use Tansu.

926
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:00,216
The Crown Prince was unaware,
which is why it worked.

927
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:03,225
But you used Tansu with water
from a puddle everyone can see.

928
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,518
It was not hard to block.

929
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,949
Win!

930
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:24,615
-You did great!
-Amazing!

931
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:46,267
There are only three toads left?

932
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,601
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

933
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,692
Does that mean he has been
fighting nonstop for the past seven days?

934
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,863
It means he continuously lost.

935
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,200
I thought he would stop if he kept losing.

936
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,084
But I guess
he will keep fighting for this.

937
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,710
You were right, Your Royal Highness.
His swordsmanship and spells are weak.

938
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,208
But he keeps fighting

939
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,830
only because he is persistent.

940
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,955
I know it is just a duel, but he has been
fighting Jeongjingak mages every day.

941
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,587
So I bet he is exhausted.

942
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:19,683
I am sure you will win,
Your Royal Highness.

943
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,720
Even I did not get a chance
to fight with Jeongjingak mages.

944
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,274
But I am letting Jang Uk do that

945
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,599
at the expense of my own gold toads.

946
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:29,694
Did I get fooled by Filthy Mu-deok?

947
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:52,793
Fight and perish, Jang Uk.

948
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,227
All the pain that does not kill you

949
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,150
will only make you stronger.

950
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,770
-Uk!
-You must be here for your young master.

951
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,114
Uk may be losing, but he is improving.

952
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:58,531
Do not go.

953
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,398
Do not go to your room and just stay here.

954
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:03,065
Goodness, look at your shoes.
They are drenched.

955
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,405
You are injured.

Some assassins attacked him last night.

957

who has barged in here leave so easily.

961
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:24,128
Once they run wild,
there is no turning back.

962
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:26,217
They will no longer be humans,
but monsters.

963
