2
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,197
People would wonder
if you suddenly disappeared.

3
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,491
Letting others witness you dying in public

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,785
will make things much easier.

5
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,663
I would still like to save face.

6
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,625
I hope it will not be a disgraceful death.

7
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,884
- Master!
- My lord!

8
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,345
What is he saying?

9
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,349
- What happened?
- Look!

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,927
Assassins!

11
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,423
Master!

12
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,309
I will be sure to use your body well.

13
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,947
Young Master.

14
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,246
Darn it, Uk.

15
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,995
That is fine.

16
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,962
Do not come in.

17
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,760
What a shame.

18
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,471
Uk landed more blows this time.

19
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,805
- Are there two more left?
- Yes.

20
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,435
Cha Beom will be up against him tomorrow.

21
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,519
Darn it. I would hate
to see Uk lose to him.

22
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,569
Should I go instead?

23
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,234
If I let Uk win,
then this will all be over.

24
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,778
I doubt that will make Uk happy.

25
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,358
This is a bet against the Crown Prince.

26
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,027
It will simply be outsmarting him.

27
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,122
Uk may be losing, but he is improving.

28
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,206
Young Master.

29
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,960
Go to your room. Let me bring you a towel.

30
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,893
I do not know
who the last contender will be.

31
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,849
But Uk will not be defeated that easily.

32
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,322
Uk!

33
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,786
Where is Young Master Jang?

34
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,931
You must be here for your young master.

35
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,665
Yes, my lady.

36
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,208
You must be Mu-deok.

37
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,588
- Yes, my lady.
- I see.

38
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,632
You are the one
who is always by Young Master Jang's side.

39
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,427
She must be the egret
that Maidservant Kim mentioned.

40
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,765
I am here to see him before I leave.

41
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,266
Come in. Right.

42
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,310
I even brought some snacks.
Would you like some?

43
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,146
No, thank you.

44
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,775
She is sophisticated and polite
just like Maidservant Kim said.

45
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,300
Why are you still drenched
and standing there?

46
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,676
Hey, look.

47
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,080
This is what that guy did, right?

48
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,831
I should try it again with my sword.

49
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,627
I thought you were dispirited
after being thrown into the lake.

50
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,421
But you were just reviewing your fight.

51
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,756
I was downcast and embarrassed
the first couple of times.

52
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
I am just mad
that I have lost eight times.

53
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,387
You used to only wear
neatly-ironed clothes.

54
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,352
Seeing how you are still
in those filthy, wet ones

55
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,846
proves what you just said.

56
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,646
I am truly dirty.

57
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,821
You rushed yourself today.

58
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,236
You should not have charged at him
when he was in defense.

59
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,286
You should have waited for him
to put his guard down.

60
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,498
Right.

61
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,332
Had you suddenly taken a step back
after landing those blows,

62
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,796
he would have been relieved,
stopped defending,

63
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,340
and let down his guard.

64
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,130
Fighting is like a game of tug-of-war.

65
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,509
Your opponent will pull
if you feign letting your guard down.

66
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
That is when you should strike.

67
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,139
Thank you for your advice, master.

68
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,566
Where are you going?

69
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,068
I should bathe and get changed.

70
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,784
I think I am reeking as well.

71
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,369
You must be here for your young master.

72
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,207
Do not go.

73
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Do not go to your room and just stay here.

74
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,298
- I will bring you your clothes.
- What for?

75
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,215
I can go get changed.

76
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,980
Why would you be a fool
and tire yourself out?

77
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,402
You are right.

78
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,112
I am just being a fool.

79
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,488
You may go.

80
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,117
Mu-deok.

81
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,623
Stop there.

82
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,496
What is it?

83
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,759
Sit down.

84
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,761
Come on.

85
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,852
Goodness, look at your shoes.
They are drenched.

86
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,145
Whyâ¦

87
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,941
Why would you follow me
and try to jump into the water?

88
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,030
You see, there are times
when you are unnecessarily hard-working.

89
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,736
Why do you put your heart into cleaning?

90
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,197
Just use me as your excuse and rest up.

91
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,416
Maidservant Kim sent
some abalones and dried yellow corvina.

92
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,381
You should have some yourself.
Do not give them all to me.

93
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,882
Do not worry.

94
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,677
Everyone treats me well
since I am close with Dang-go,

95
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,181
the heir of Songrim.

96
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,385
That is what I thought.

97
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,607
I knew you would use
your power to your advantage.

98
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,073
You are injured.

99
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,370
I fought for eight days on end.

100
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,872
This is not my only wound.

101
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,752
Then where else?

102
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,501
Let us go to Sejukwon and get you treated.

103
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,165
I still have more fights left.

104
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,471
I should get injured as much as I can,

105
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,550
as much as my master expects of me.

106
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,240
Your feet will freeze.

107
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,783
You should get changed too.

108
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,661
Maidservant Kim?

109
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,255
You are ready, Your Royal Highness.

110
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,339
The medicine does not stop being bitter.
Do you have anything sweet?

111
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,586
I will prepare the sweetest snack.

112
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,565
There should be a red jade
that goes with it.

113
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,492
They are only valuable
when they are together.

114
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,815
Should I just throw this away?

115
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,566
What?

116
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,355
What is wrong with this?

117
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,003
What could this be?

118
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,641
Someone is pulling me in with great force.

119
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,109
This in explain able attractionâ¦

120
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,232
It is calling to me.

121
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,035
- Damn it.
- Damn it!

122
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,455
Why would you fill her jade with energy

123
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,539
and confuse me like that?

124
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,501
This greatly offends me.

125
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,415
Likewise.

126
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:43,052
I am truly offended that
you were the reason why my heart raced.

127
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,341
Darn it.

128
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,927
By the way,

129
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,142
did you feel it too?

130
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,936
Did your heart thumpâ¦

131
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,324
- Darn it.
- Do not say that.

132
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,147
Forget it.

133
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,155
Seeing how surprised you are,

134
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,029
I guess you have never used this properly.

135
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,777
Right.

136
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,408
Since Mu-deok does not know magic,

137
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,704
I doubt you two were able
to share your energy.

138
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,868
You are right.

139
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,075
I did not know this jade had such power.

140
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,393
That is enough!

141
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,770
- Darn it.
- Anyway, I learned something new

142
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,074
because of you.

143
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,818
- Thank you.
- What is it?

144
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,992
Are you planning to use it?

145
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,359
I doubt you will be able to.

146
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,157
Mu-deok will not get this back.

147
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,201
I still have two matches left.

148
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,787
I will get it back and put it to good use.

149
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,831
So please keep it safe until then.

150
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,833
And please do not ever

151
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,922
fill it with your energy again.

152
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,420
The same goes for you.

153
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,184
Your Royal Highness, where have you been?

154
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,769
Should I take you in?

155
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,308
I can do that.

156
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,227
There must be things you can do here too.

157
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,779
No, thank you.

158
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,694
- Eunuch Oh.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

159
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,698
Find out who will be up against Uk next.

160
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,281
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

161
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,026
You better be right.

162
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,869
THE ART OF HYEONGONG

163
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,828
Hey.

164
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,830
How was Jang Uk?

165
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,044
Jang Uk? It was a cakewalk to beat him.

166
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,170
- Are you ready for your match?
- Of course.

167
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,724
At the very end, I will use Hyeongong toâ¦

168
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,045
He is a mage from the Cha family
who can use Hyeongong.

169
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,765
He had been watching Uk all along.

170
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,689
He is a coward who has only stepped up
after seeing Uk lose several times.

171
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,482
Uk might be able to beat him.

172
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,149
Hyeongong is a spell that
may look fancy on the outside.

173
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,201
But it will be useless
if the user lacks the skills.

174
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,156
Beom may look intimidating
at first glance,

175
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,663
but that could just be a front.

176
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,174
Yul sure can see through others.

177
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,745
Is that so?

178
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,672
But he was telling others
about how easy it would be

179
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,961
to beat Young Master Jang.

180
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,127
He is just worried.

181
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,427
Uk has improved greatly
in the past several days.

182
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,642
He is scared that Uk will beat him.

183
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,097
I guess my young master has improved
quite a bit for him to be worried.

184
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,106
Are you that thrilled
that Uk has become stronger?

185
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,110
Of course. I cannot be any prouder.

186
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,487
Naksu is training Uk.

187
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,662
Yul.

188
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,910
Did you hear?

189
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,704
There is a commotion in the capital.

190
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,747
What happened?

191
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,461
Master Kang from Daegangtongun
succumbed to his illness.

192
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,876
But rumor has it

193
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,666
that some assassins
attacked him last night.

194
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,836
My uncle and Master Heo
rushed over to his funeral.

195
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,178
What if more assassins
like Naksu have appeared?

196
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,743
THE LATE KANG MAN-CHEON

197
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,027
Why can we not offer our condolences?

198
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,787
Transporting precious goods
is our family business.

199
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,457
But if people find out
that the man of the house

200
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,251
was killed by some assassins,
we could become jobless.

201
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,882
We told everyone
he died of a contagious disease.

202
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,471
That is why no one can enter.

203
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,428
We understand.

204
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,312
Have you found any evidence
that could help us find the assassins?

205
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,937
Has an autopsy been carried out?

206
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,065
Master Kang was stabbed to death
in front of our eyes.

207
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,979
An autopsy is unnecessary.

208
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,400
We will cremate his body tonight.

209
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,027
That soon?

210
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,740
It is unfortunate.

211
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,658
But we must hurry
before the rumor spreads.

212
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,662
I am certain Master Kang would have
also wanted this for his family.

213
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,786
That is unacceptable.

214
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,003
If you cremate his body,

215
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,247
there will be no evidence
that will link to the assassins.

216
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,132
This is a family matter.

217
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,296
I understand that you are worried.

218
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,313
But the leader of Songrim
does not need to concern himself with it.

219
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,017
An autopsy is needed.

220
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,811
Postpone the cremation.

221
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,028
Has Songrim gone as far as to meddle
in other families' funerals?

222
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,743
We are not meddling.

223
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,738
I am simply trying to prevent
the new man of the house

224
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,744
from making an irreversible mistake.

225
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,868
Why is Songrim's leader against this?

226
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,495
What gives you the right?

227
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,127
Only recently did Naksu attack
the mages in the capital.

228
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,301
Now, new assassins have emerged.

229
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,757
There could be a link between this case
and Naksu who used sorcery.

230
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,635
That is why I am interfering.

231
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,679
There was no sorcery involved.

232
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,680
I witnessed it all.

233
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,644
How can you be so sure without an autopsy?

234
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,478
The new man of the house
does not want an autopsy.

235
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,772
Jin Mu! You have no say in this.

236
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,400
We have the right to interfere
if there are suspicions

237
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,068
of sorcery being involved.

238
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,612
Do you not agree, Lady Jin?

239
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,953
I believe

240
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,124
the Assistant Gwanju is right this time.

241
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,498
The family's heir witnessed
Master Kang's death.

242
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,125
And he has no choice but to hide it
due to their family business.

243
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,967
No evidence hinted
at sorcery being involved.

244
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,143
So I do not think Songrim
should cause a commotion here.

245
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,191
I just want to protect his honor.

246
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,735
Please let us proceed
with this funeral discreetly.

247
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,928
Jin Mu does not hesitate
to look down on Songrim now.

248
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,232
Why are they so against the idea?

249
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,562
- It is suspicious.
- By the way,

250
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,776
I had no idea
Lady Jin would take Jin Mu's side.

251
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,699
She used to hate her half-brother.

252
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,117
I was truly pleased when you took my side.

253
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,036
Look.

254
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,342
Songrim had no choice but to back down
once we joined hands.

255
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,046
How close are you to finding Bu-yeon?

256
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,968
We searched all the areas
around Lake Gyeongcheondaeho

257
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,102
for blind girls
who were around Bu-yeon's age.

258
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,267
I have been doing that for ten years now.

259
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,391
To be honest,

260
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,807
I believe I found
the whereabouts of Bu-yeon.

261
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,534
A young girl had washed up
near the lake ten years ago.

262
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,156
- Is that so?
- Howeverâ¦

263
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,785
She was long dead.

264
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,545
Mother, I doubt that was her.

265
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,259
I told my men to dig up her grave.

266
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,467
If Bu-yeon truly is dead,

267
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,141
I will bring her body
back to you at all costs.

268
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,522
That is unacceptable.

269
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,061
Bring my daughter back alive.

270
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,399
I will, so please calm down.

271
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,525
We will find her alive.

272
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,036
Did you take a good look?

273
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,209
They will be your mother
and younger sister.

274
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,052
Do you think

275
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,176
they will think that I am their daughter?

276
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,590
You are dressed

277
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,806
like Bu-yeon when she was young.

278
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,890
But I am not sure if Ho-gyeong will agree.

279
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,613
Then being well-dressed

280
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,229
will not benefit us.

281
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,358
I must look shabbier and more pathetic.

282
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,695
She is a mother who has lost her daughter.

283
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,832
I can only win her heart
by pulling at her heartstrings.

284
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,794
Yes.

285
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,459
You are right, So-i.

286
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,974
I will see to itâ¦

287
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,546
That I become a daughter
of the Jin family.

288
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,322
You look much better now.

289
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,236
I tend to recover quickly.

290
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,785
This Hyeongong techniqueâ¦

291
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,133
Is quite elaborate.

292
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,925
I have my suspicions
regarding Master Kang's death.

293
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:32,068
Master Kang was powerful
with a great mastery of spells.

294
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,815
But he was already suffering
from a fatal illness.

295
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,995
There was no need for anyone
to send the assassins.

296
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,209
Maybe someone had a grudge against him

297
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,078
and wanted to kill him themselves.

298
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,084
No.

299
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,998
There must be a reason

300
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,803
why those assassins came,
although we do not know yet.

301
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,102
Once the soul is shifted,
the former body becomes useless.

302
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,721
But we cannot get rid of it that easily.

303
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,268
In other people's eyes,
that body belongs to a powerful mage,

304
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,233
an administrative officer, or a merchant.

305
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,527
They will only suspect something
if that individual disappears.

306
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:15,028
Naksu was the one who took care of them.

307
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,155
Do you mean the Shadow Assassin?

308
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,084
Thanks to that crazy assassin,

309
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,964
Songrim never suspected
that I was making soul shifters.

310
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,585
Back when I was after Naksu,

311
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,175
I thought she was just a lunatic
who wanted to show off her skills.

312
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,219
That is why I never suspected
the individuals that she killed.

313
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,769
Are you saying that she killed those

314
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,808
whose souls have been shifted by Jin Mu?

315
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,305
To be exact,

316
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,478
they must have been those
who were discarded afterward.

317
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,198
Did you not say
that Naksu was Cho Chung's daughter?

318
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,778
Are you saying he took that little girl
and turned her into an assassin?

319
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,998
That is why I never revealed myself to her

320
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,958
and made her live
in the mountains by herself.

321
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,710
I took care of her
just enough for her to survive.

322
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,466
But she was determined
and grew to be remarkably strong.

323
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,550
Becauseâ¦

324
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,967
She thought by doing so
she would be avenging her parents.

325
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,557
That is why she obeyed Jin Mu.

326
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,937
She was very useful.

327
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,441
Then a soul shifter ran wild before dying.

328
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,398
Thanks to him,

329
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,704
Songrim got wind of the alchemy of souls.

330
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,909
Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her,

331
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,452
he was probably afraid of getting caught.

332
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:49,165
He probably sent Naksu to Songrim
despite knowing that she would die.

333
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,765
Mu-deok, go and get some water.

334
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,889
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,695
Mu-deok, will you seriously
not listen to me?

336
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,819
I told you to just get some rest.

337
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,406
Then what about you?

338
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,454
Did I not tell you to treat your wounds?

339
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,748
I stopped by Sejukwon.
At least I listened to you.

340
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,671
Check for yourself.

341
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,176
I smell mugwort.

342
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,679
What is wrong with you?

343
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,097
You know I am struggling these days.
I am just exhausted.

344
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,649
How warm.

345
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,453
Did you get a hot mugwort massage?

346
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,373
Yes. I am warm, right?

347
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,370
Yes. You are.

348
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,470
She was used for all the wrong reasons
and met a terrible death.

349
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,508
Naksuâ¦

350
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,433
I truly pity her.

351
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,475
You are cool now. Let me go.

352
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,277
- Did you change your shoes?
- Yes.

353
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,285
Did you have the food
Maidservant Kim brought?

354
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,730
Yes. I had already had some
before you even mentioned them.

355
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,078
Well done. Mu-deok.

356
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,752
I did not know how fascinating this was.

357
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,586
The yin-and-yang jade?

358
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,110
I only found out because you had given it
to the Crown Prince.

359
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,007
How is it fascinating?

360
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,051
- Show me.
- I cannot.

361
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,715
I will show you

362
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,934
once I get yours back.

363
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,732
You will give it to me again

364
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,136
after you get it back?

365
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,316
Why? Will you not accept it?

366
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,655
I will retrieve it
and place it in your hand.

367
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,529
This thing has unbelievable powers.

368
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,947
It is a relief we did not know.

369
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,575
You are in for a shock once I get it back.

370
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,837
What kind of powers? Show me.

371
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,383
The Crown Prince
foamed in the mouth and fainted.

372
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,375
It was terrifying.

373
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,966
That makes sense. It was from Jinyowon.

374
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,052
It could be a lethal weapon.

375
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,333
Hello, Assistant Gwanju.

376
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,335
The leader of Songrim returned

377
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,549
to watch the cremation for himself.

378
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,341
What will you do this time around?

379
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,175
I am only here to observe.

380
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,097
This is the last time
I will ever see Master Kang.

381
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,601
It is my duty to see him off.

382
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,465
You have seen a soul shifter before,

383
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,473
so you will recognize the blue mark.

384
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,767
Check and see if Master Kang's body
had been used for soul shifting.

385
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,101
Even if we find out
that he has shifted souls,

386
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,357
we will not know
whose body he has shifted into.

387
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,692
There is something you must do
to help us find that out.

388
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,729
I know that you have
already mastered Chisu.

389
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,855
I did not hide it on purpose.

390
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,361
I am not scolding you.

391
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,986
What I am about to ask you to do

392
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,610
is quite dangerous
and might suck away your energy.

393
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,737
Only those
who have mastered Chisu can do it.

394
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,957
A soul shifter runs wild
once their energy is lost.

395
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,320
The body is still warm.

396
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,377
Pour your energy into him.

397
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,343
And make him run wild.

398
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,203
My lordâ¦

399
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,118
What is it?

400
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,826
He isâ¦

401
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,730
I will collect his bones, so step aside.

402
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,731
This is a soul shifter

403
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,985
who has been petrified after running wild.

404
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,034
Now that we have solid evidence
of sorcery being involved,

405
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,659
can Songrim take over?

406
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,547
Seeing how you are not disturbed
and even tried to hide it,

407
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,592
you must have already known about this.

408
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,969
You already knew

409
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,519
that this was a soul shifter
who had run wild.

410
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,041
Judging by your skills,

411
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,258
I believe Master Kang's soul
is within that body.

412
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,800
Then that body's original soul

413
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,969
must be dead alongside your body.

414
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,763
Cut that nonsense!

415
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,451
You are running wild

416
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,004
after having lost blood and energy.

417
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,498
The more you use your skills,
the faster you will become petrified.

418
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,417
You better stop.

419
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,095
You should stop here.

420
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,351
- Do not kill him!
- Kill him.

421
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,205
A soul shifter who is running wild
is dangerous.

422
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,512
Thankfully, Cheonbugwan got rid of him.

423
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:21,589
Since you have helped us,

424
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,934
we will let Songrim take credit for this.

425
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,015
- My lord.
- Yes?

426
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,568
Since you said we could take credit,

427
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,704
we will take the body and examine it.

428
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,579
Be my guest.

429
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,591
I closed his gate of energy

430
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,385
to prevent more energy from seeping out.

431
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,217
We need to revive him and make him talk.

432
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,563
Will it be possible?

433
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,479
He is pretty much a breathing stone.
Yet you want him to speak?

434
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,023
This will not be easy.

435
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,445
Are you worried
that he may still be alive?

436
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,660
Even so, they will not succeed.

437
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,171
Perhaps it is possible
with the help of the ice stone.

438
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,247
But that is their only bet.

439
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,047
Are you saying he can be revived
with the ice stone?

440
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,131
That is correct.

441
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,683
And you are in possession of that stone?

442
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,264
You do not need to know that.

443
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,480
Get the assassins ready.

444
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,766
I will find a way

445
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,402
even if it means shifting the soul
of a Jeongjingak mage.

446
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,697
- Hey, Beom.
- What?

447
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:09,890
Let us go.

448
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,374
THE ART OF HYEONGONG

449
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,038
PRESSING THE HEAD OF A LEOPARD STANCE

450
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,957
DIRECT SENDING STANCE, CAULDRON STANCE

451
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,465
Yul.

452
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,635
Uk.

453
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,982
Are you going to train?

454
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,146
Yes.

455
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:06,898
And you?

456
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,203
I just slashedâ¦

457
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,488
A soul shifter.

458
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,543
Master Kang who had passed away yesterday
was a soul shifter.

459
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,377
Really?

460
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,301
But how did you know that?

461
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,299
If they hide their blue mark,

462
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,553
they can easily blend in
with other people.

463
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,219
But once they run wild,

464
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,930
there is no turning back.

465
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,570
They will start to petrify
as their energy seeps out.

466
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,492
They can prevent that
by feeding on others' energy.

467
00:42:55,043 --> 00:42:56,543
But once they do that,

468
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,577
they will no longer be humans,
but monsters.

469
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,959
Monsters?

470
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,394
And it is our duty to protect this worldâ¦

471
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,110
From such monsters.

472
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,370
We can also protect
the monsters from this world.

473
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,905
Once we keep them in check,

474
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,616
the world will be at peace.

475
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,501
Everyone had high hopes for you
ever since you were little,

476
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,545
so you think
you need to do something grand.

477
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,960
But I was told

478
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,255
to sit still all my life.

479
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,930
I will follow

480
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,273
my heart.

481
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,129
Jin Mu let Songrim find out
something critical.

482
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,923
What if Songrim suspects
the palace as well?

483
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,965
The Royal Palaceâ¦

484
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:44,428
Is not a place he can just barge into
like he did at Daegangtongun.

485
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,555
If he does, I will be in danger.

486
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,978
Ever since Gil-ju died,

487
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,862
I was not able to feed on energy.

488
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,279
I am afraid I will run wild.

489
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:02,239
Could you share some of the power

490
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,725
of the ice stone with me?

491
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,953
What did you say?

492
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,457
The only person who can serve you
despite knowing your true faceâ¦

493
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,340
Is only me, is it not?

494
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,758
Shaman.

495
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,634
You littleâ¦

496
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,218
I told you never to address me like that.

497
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,515
Would you like
to be petrified this instant?

498
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:32,477
I know you cannot do that.

499
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,524
I am the only one in this palace

500
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,527
who knows that you are Shaman Choi,

501
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,661
despite residing in the Queen's body.

502
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,533
If I die,

503
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,827
you will bring your sibling here
from Jinyowon?

504
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,378
Furthermore,

505
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:01,088
the real Queen is residing in your body.

506
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:07,385
Should I not visit her from time to time?

507
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,023
Right?

508
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,692
It is getting difficult for me

509
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,652
to live in this body.

510
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,862
Tell Jin Mu

511
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,776
to shift my soul
into someone else's body once again,

512
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,754
Your Highness.

513
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,415
I understand.

514
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,881
You may leave.

515
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,235
Why are you here?

516
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,407
I will let you beat me.
Then it will all be over.

517
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,159
I forfeit.

518
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,038
Hey, Uk!

519
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,838
You wanted to go before me.

520
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,175
And you won.

521
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,602
Dang-go was willing to let you beat him.

522
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,056
How could you refuse?

523
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,515
I did not know
you were this proud of yourself.

524
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,525
You gave me this signal
and told me not to fight him.

525
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,689
When did I?

526
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,607
I only looked at you out of relief.

527
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,446
Then you should have signaled me.

528
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,025
Like this.

529
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,406
I did.

530
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,793
How could I understand that?
Had I known, I would have just done it.

531
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,921
You only have one chance left.

532
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,875
What will you do?

533
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,460
What, are you blaming me?

534
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,665
Why are you getting mad at me
when you gave that jade to him?

535
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,296
Are you seriously
pointing fingers right now?

536
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,843
How childish.

537
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,427
Childish? Do you want me
to show you what real childishness is?

538
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,513
I quit.

539
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,599
Should I keep this up?

540
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,493
Mages have been guarding
Sejukwon since last night.

541
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,491
The soul shifter's body must be in there.

542
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,325
If it was a body, they would have
kept it in the secret room.

543
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,538
Why would they take it to Sejukwon,
which is for the living?

544
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,050
I came by because I was curious
about what happened to the body.

545
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,385
Please wait. I will inform our leader.

546
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,490
I heard the leader was here at Sejukwon,
so I came to see him.

547
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,076
No one is allowed
to enter Sejukwon at the moment.

548
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,450
Then I will meet
with Young Master Jang first.

549
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,617
Please tell the leader that I am here.

550
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,458
Jin Mu is here

551
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,835
to check if the soul shifter
has really died or not.

552
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,341
Tell him to leave
since we are still investigating.

553
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,505
Yes, my lord. However,
someone else is here to see you.

554
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,466
Tell them to leave.

555
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,135
No one is allowed anywhere near Sejukwon.

556
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,175
Yes, my lord.

557
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,727
I will tell Maidservant Kim
to leave as well.

558
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,151
What?

559
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,399
Maidservant Kim?

560
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,363
I will tell her
that the leader cannot meet anyone.

561
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,490
Hold on.

562
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,203
She can be an exception.

563
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,259
It has been a long time, Maidservant Kim.

564
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,988
I stayed at Gwanju Jang Gang's residence
when I served him,

565
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,615
and you made me
countless delicious dishes.

566
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,203
You ate so much

567
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,123
that your rice bowl was exceptionally big.

568
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,375
Do you remember?

569
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,628
You had a huge brass bowl.

570
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,672
Back in the day, I was always hungry.

571
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,181
You must have made
something scrumptious once again.

572
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,892
Yes, I have. I made these snacks myself.

573
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,647
Honey biscuits.
I used to love them back in the day.

574
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,940
Yes, indeed.

575
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,026
Every time I gave some to you
to give to the Gwanju,

576
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,160
you would stash a few in your pockets.

577
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:20,044
I did that because I was only allowed
to eat once he finished.

578
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,997
In any case, I benefited a lot
from the Gwanju while following him.

579
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,131
I had a chance to taste
such delicious treats

580
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,554
and learn a special spell.

581
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,137
Does it not taste sweeter
if you eat it in secret?

582
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,146
That is exactly why

583
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,565
things that taste sweet are dangerous.

584
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,649
Once you have a taste of it,
you desire it at all costs.

585
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,621
You fail to distinguish

586
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,739
what you can have

587
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,164
and what you cannot.

588
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,000
You are hurting my feelings
by not letting me have any.

589
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:16,554
Goodness, do not be so stingy with food.

590
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,056
The Gwanju loved this snack.

591
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,017
How about his son?

592
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,145
Young Master Uk loves
honey biscuits as well.

593
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,689
Then shall we share this with him?

594
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:37,148
I have many stories
to tell him about his father.

595
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:48,039
You and Uk have nothing to talk about.

596
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,832
You may leave.

597
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,746
He just wants a biscuit.
Do not be so heartless.

598
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,631
You are not letting me share
the good memories with him.

599
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,715
But then again,

600
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,927
you must not want me
to touch what is yours.

601
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,894
Wait.

602
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,976
Here. This was actually
for our young master,

603
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,611
but you can have it instead.

604
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,227
Maidservant Kim.

605
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,359
Do not give that to him.

606
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,316
If I truly wanted to have some,

607
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,322
I would have easily stolen a few of them.

608
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,200
But I will let you win.

609
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,921
It had been a while since we last met.
I am truly sad to say goodbye.

610
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,049
Jin Mu used to take revenge

611
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,014
if he was scolded for eating something.

612
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,259
They were just honey biscuits.

613
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,968
You should have let him have them.

614
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,138
I just did not want him to eat

615
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,319
what you worked so hard to make.

616
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
Sit down.

617
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,486
We have not seen each other in a while.

618
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,990
Let us chat over some tea.

619
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,329
Is something wrong?

620
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,713
You seem quite testy.

621
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,000
Do not worry.

622
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,471
Once I have your honey biscuits,
I will feel better.

623
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,725
Mu-deok.

624
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,516
I need you to run an errand.

625
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,566
An errand? What is it?

626
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,860
Go to Cheonbugwan.

627
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,359
This just does not feel right,
so I need to send this over.

628
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,949
Sure.

629
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,615
Is something going on at Sejukwon?

630
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,208
I do not know the details.

631
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,803
But I think it is related
to last night's incident at Daegangtongun.

632
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,759
I heard Cheonbugwan
and Songrim had a fight.

633
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,097
Where is Yul?

634
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,891
I have not seen him since last night.

635
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,885
He must be doing something for the leader.

636
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,265
Really?

637
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,146
I just slashedâ¦

638
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,686
A soul shifter.

639
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,458
We must strengthen Songrim's boundaries.

640
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,382
You are forbidden
from leaving Songrim for the time being.

641
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,047
Those who have mastered Ryusu and more

642
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,551
shall go to Sejukwon
and follow Sang-ho's orders.

643
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,835
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

644
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,637
Jang Uk.

645
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,890
You will stay here.

646
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,018
Everyone except for Uk

647
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,896
will follow Sang-ho and go to Sejukwon.

648
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,270
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

649
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,990
My lord.

650
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,782
Why am I not going?

651
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,656
You are exempt
since we do not need you there.

652
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,792
Is there something dangerous there?

653
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,211
Is it a soul shifter?

654
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,882
It is none of your concern.

655
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,045
Do not be curious about it.

656
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,919
Why are you keeping me in the dark
when I am also a mage here?

657
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,337
You are excluded from everything.

658
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,718
If you are bored of being alone,
you may leave Songrim.

659
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,176
Go back to your home
and do whatever makes you comfortable.

660
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:42,363
Yes, my lord.
Thank you for worrying about my comfort.

661
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,628
Mu-deok.

662
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,004
Let us go to Chwiseonru
and have something tasty.

663
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:10,091
All the mages were headed to Sejukwon.
Why are you not there?

664
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,137
I was told to stay out of it

665
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,221
and that I did not need
to concern myself with the matter.

666
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,438
- Let us go.
- Maidservant Kim gave me an errand to do.

667
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,605
Sure. Let us go together. Where to?

668
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,570
Cheonbugwan.

669
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,317
Let us go.

670
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:36,660
I heard that you told her
to shift you into another body.

671
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,118
Will you do that?

672
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:45,165
Then let me shift souls with that girl
who will enter Jinyowon as Jin Bu-yeon.

673
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,257
I have been a eunuch for a while,

674
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,718
so I do not mind a woman's body.

675
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:57,430
I would like to shift my soul
into a powerful body like the Shaman has.

676
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,350
"Shaman."

677
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,938
She was offended by how you reminded her

678
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,152
that she was a shaman dealing
with trifling affairs like divinations.

679
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,355
I was only stating a fact.

680
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:16,491
I was also reminded today of how I used
to beg for food and steal snacks.

681
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,211
They were indeed facts,
but I was still unhappy to hear them.

682
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,219
Jin Mu wanted a honey biscuit
while visiting Songrim,

683
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,103
but Park Jin did not let him have any.

684
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,722
Maidservant Kim was worried
he would hold a grudge,

685
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,767
so she wanted me to deliver this.

686
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,811
Are you saying they were childish enough
to fight over some food?

687
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,646
Our leader has a cheap way
of tormenting others.

688
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,568
Why was he so picky about a honey biscuit?

689
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,952
You are right. He was cheap.

690
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,618
Here, at Cheonbugwan,

691
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,504
we have records of all the constellations.

692
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,190
I will tell the Assistant Gwanju
that this was from the Jang family.

693
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,605
Please tell him that
it was from Maidservant Kim.

694
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,236
Tell him that we use a lot of oil
in our honey biscuits

695
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,615
and that he should have them
with green tea.

696
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,786
Yes, Young Master Jang.

697
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,498
We also use a lot of honey
for our honey biscuits.

698
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,875
He should store them in a cool place
or they will become sticky.

699
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,377
- Yes, Young Master Jang.
- Since we have brought that,

700
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,421
- can I take a look inside?
- Yes...

701
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,915
- Sorry?
- Thank you. It will not take long.

702
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,008
Let us go.

703
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,594
Butâ¦

704
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,312
I have always wanted to visit.

705
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,856
Despite my father being the Gwanju,
I never got to visit.

706
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,662
Gosh, what is that?

707
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,035
You have been here, right?

708
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,249
Your father was
a constellation recorder mage.

709
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,334
Did you come here for me?

710
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,050
You could have asked
someone else to run the errand.

711
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,764
Was it not
because you wanted to come here?

712
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,480
My father brought me here often
when I was little.

713
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:50,021
He even showed me the plate
that was recorded the day I was born.

714
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,111
He was a considerate father.

715
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,151
Come to think of it,

716
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,317
I believe he recorded the constellation
on the day you were born.

717
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,201
Is that so?

718
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:10,037
The constellation of the day I was born
must be somewhere here.

719
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,928
You had promised to shift my soul.

720
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,104
But rather, you are making me run wild.

721
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,189
You are no longer needed.

722
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,274
You will turn into a stone now.

723
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,287
You have gone insane.

724
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,476
Once night draws in, the mages will come.

725
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,647
Let us watch them
record the constellations.

726
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,821
I heard it is a magnificent view.

727
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:22,736
I would love that, but it will be
troublesome if we get caught.

728
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,952
Let us just go home.

729
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,254
Eunuch Kim has run wild.

730
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,718
No one must find out
that he is a soul shifter.

731
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,719
He is still in Cheonbugwan.
We must find him before morning comes.

732
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:46,973
Yes, my lord.

733
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,849
I know you are here.

734
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,685
Do not cause any more problems
and just come out.

735
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,309
I will give you what you want.

736
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,663
Come on out.

737
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,869
- Come on out!
- I will.

738
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,874
- Jang Uk.
- Yes.

739
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,051
Why are you here?

740
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,216
I am sorry. I was running an errand

741
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,840
and decided to take a look around.

742
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,309
An errand?

743
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,523
I heard you really wanted
our honey biscuits.

744
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,058
Honey biscuits?

745
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,191
She saw you were sad that
you did not have any honey biscuits,

746
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,025
so Maidservant Kim told me
to send you some.

747
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,074
Thank you. Tell her I said thank you.

748
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,954
What?

749
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,288
I thought you would be upset
that I came in here without asking.

750
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:36,908
Are you not mad?

751
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,288
You only came here to give me
the honey biscuits. You may go.

752
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,586
What a relief. To be honestâ¦

753
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,131
I have company.

754
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,430
Mu-deok, come out. He is not mad.

755
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,473
She is my maid.

756
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,805
I am Mu-deok,

757
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,442
his maid.

758
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,519
You were here as well.

759
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,231
I thought you would be furious.

760
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,444
I am truly grateful for your hospitality.

761
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,818
Please enjoy the snacks.

762
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,235
Let us know if you want more.

763
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,243
Thank you.

764
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,448
Let us go.

765
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,846
He is a royal eunuch.

766
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,310
What is wrong with him?

767
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,979
He is a soul shifter.

768
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,443
Look. He is running wild.

769
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,815
I cannot believe a soul shifter
was inside the palace.

770
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,948
It was probably

771
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,116
his doing.

772
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,826
I know you are here.

773
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,710
Do not cause
any more problems and just come out.

774
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,554
I will give you what you want.

775
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,764
Come on out!

776
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,614
I will.

777
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,716
Run.

778
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,104
There is a door behind us.

779
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,738
Why will you not let us leave?

780
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:15,816
I do not think it is right to let a mage
who has barged in here leave so easily.

781
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,076
You will be in a tight spot

782
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,535
if I disappeared from Cheonbugwan.

783
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,079
I never said I would harm you.

784
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,457
Your body will still be around.

785
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:35,967
Uk.

786
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,914
You are within a barrier that I have made.

787
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,616
Do not worry.

788
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,628
You will be unscathed
as long as you sit still.

789
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,172
Wait there for now.

790
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,225
Mu-deok, was it?

791
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,855
So you were the maid

792
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:16,149
who always stuck by his side
and caused a nuisance.

793
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,405
There is a human here.

794
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,079
Come and replenish your energy.

795
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,214
After that,

796
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:41,718
I will let you shift souls
with a young master as you wished.

797
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,231
Did that wench Shaman Choi

798
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,824
tell you to kill me?

799
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,824
I need your help.

800
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,445
If you do not trust me,
I will stay outside.

801
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,581
Feed on her as you please.

802
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,839
I need to get out of here.

803
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,693
Master, help me once again.

804
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,824
Give your hesitant pupil confidence.

805
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,503
Jang Uk.

806
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,674
Mu-deok.

807
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,381
Mu-deok!

808
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,365
Mu-deok.

809
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,984
Mu-deok.

810
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,449
Iâ¦

811
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,700
I just fed on his energy.

812
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,126
Am Iâ¦

813
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,302
Running wild?

814
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,563
- Mu-deok.
- Do not come near me.

815
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,490
No, you are fine.

816
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,624
You are all right.

817
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,212
- You will be fine.
- No.

818
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,249
Do not touch me.

819
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,957
If I am truly running wild,

820
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,014
then you must not touch me.

821
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,223
Otherwise, your energy will be stolen

822
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:21,228
and you will die.

823
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,536
There was a loud noise coming from
the Constellation Recording room.

824
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,995
Come on out!

825
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,039
Are you angry that we turned
your friend here into stone?

826
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,876
You will never be able
to leave this place.

827
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,004
Are you saying that a member
of the Cho family is in this household?

828
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:18,925
What if her spirit
is indeed lingering by Uk?

829
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,929
If I had not left you
there in the mountainsâ¦

830
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,931
You would not have to suffer this fate.

831
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,425
You said you have bet your life?

832
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,516
This time, place yourself for the bet.

833
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,228
I will definitely win tomorrow.

834
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,397
I only need those
who will definitely win the duel.

835
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,066
If he is looking for
the ice stone to protect herâ¦

836
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,150
They must not be together.

837
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:38,704
Everything about you has been exposed.

838
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:46,406
