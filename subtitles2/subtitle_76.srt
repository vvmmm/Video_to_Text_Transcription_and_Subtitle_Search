FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,951
EUN-HEE

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,465
{\an8}Eun-hee.

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,505
{\an8}I was curious about so many things.

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,811
{\an8}Eun-hee.

7
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,734
{\an8}I'm sorry.

8
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,689
{\an8}I'm not really sure what family is.

9
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,587
Can I see that too, please?

10
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,772
Excuse me.

11
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,139
Can Iâ¦

12
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,056
get three of these, please?

13
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,694
So would that be one ring
and three necklaces?

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,862
Yes.

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,534
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,150
about the biggest decision
in the 26 years of my life.

17
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,738
I think my family
will stop me if I tell them,

18
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,247
so I'm running away now.

19
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,211
I've been planning this for a long time,

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,459
but I'm not all that happy.

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,132
I thought it'd be freeing
to leave my family,

22
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,052
but if you explain it to my sisters
and comfort them,

23
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,222
I'm sure they will make
Mom and Dad understand.

24
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,926
I'm sorry,

25
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,892
Chan-hyuk.

26
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,021
Was Iâ¦

27
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,558
nothing to Ji-woo?

28
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,021
Am I just a family
he wants to escape from?

29
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,452
What's going to happen to my family?

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,986
We seriously knewâ¦

31
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,003
nothing about each other.

32
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,984
Ji-woo is a grown-up.

33
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,228
He can leave anywhere if he wants.

34
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,357
Even if it's family,

35
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,493
if he wants to leave, then he can.

36
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,795
There's no use now.

37
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,474
I'm going to tell Eun-joo.

38
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,142
I won'tâ¦

39
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,886
keep secrets anymore.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,605
We'll solve everything together now.

41
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,018
LOGIN

42
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,578
Eun-joo.

43
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,785
I guess he didn't want to
explain it to us.

44
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
I'm sure he couldn't even if he wanted to.

45
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,594
We had so many incidents recently.

46
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,835
He probably thought
we would be against it.

47
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,812
He's old enough to get married now.

48
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,308
We can't help but wait.

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,640
Butâ¦

50
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,022
something's bothering me.

51
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,356
How can he meet her
after sending her money first?

52
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,287
Stop thinking already.

53
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,754
Must you beat a person
who is having surgery tomorrow?

54
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,996
I'm old now.

55
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,210
I can't think of anything.

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,547
I can see it.

57
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,089
It's hard to see your path
but easy to see someone else's path.

58
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,678
Yes.

59
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,725
We are someone else.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
No, that's not what I mean.

61
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,896
Right.

62
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,782
I didn't hide the fruit

63
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,577
so I could only give it to the kids.

64
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,246
The fruit that wasn't in the refrigerator

65
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,504
was for the elders at the nursing home

66
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,127
I volunteer at.

67
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,889
I always left them there
so they won't be mixed up with ours.

68
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,517
It must've been so ridiculous for you.

69
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,352
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,268
I'm sorry too.

71
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:07,075
I knew that you got the wrong idea
and got angry because of the fruit.

72
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,081
Butâ¦

73
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,161
I didn't explain it on purpose.

74
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,789
When you got the wrong idea,

75
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,342
I felt great.

76
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,131
Yes.

77
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,965
"I hope you misunderstand that
I think it's a waste to give you fruit

78
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,682
and hate me."

79
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,388
I just let it be.

80
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,936
That's how we've been living our lives.

81
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,646
We didn't try to clear up
the misunderstandings.

82
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,317
After hearing you,

83
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,656
I nowâ¦

84
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,449
know why.

85
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,502
Why I collected sleeping pills.

86
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,711
It's because of those damn fruits?

87
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,722
That's not why.

88
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,314
I thought you'd see
the sleeping pills I collected someday.

89
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,770
"I'm always thinking of killing myself."

90
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,151
I wanted you to see them
and be filled with regret,

91
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,069
so I collected them,
without a desire to kill myself.

92
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,534
To break your heart.

93
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,004
Mr. Kim Sang-sik, it's time
to move you to a different room.

94
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,002
Why all of a sudden?

95
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,916
No way.

96
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,795
He's so strict about money.

97
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,472
I'm sure he won't be conned.

98
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,970
I don't think he's strict about money.

99
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,392
It seemed like he treats
his friends quite a lot.

100
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,812
Was he a cheapskate only to us?

101
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,311
Did you know about this?

102
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,102
How should I know?

103
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,652
I'm sure I don't know Ji-woo
as much as you do, Chan-hyuk.

104
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,571
The problems in our family

105
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,701
are like forgotten boxes
piled up in storage.

106
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,280
Then the door was opened,

107
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,991
and the baggage started
falling out all at once.

108
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,615
Is thereâ¦

109
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,666
another problem?

110
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,262
TAE-HYUNG

111
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,430
Hey.

112
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,438
Tae-hyung.

113
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,487
What brings you here?

114
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,449
Isn't fasting hard?

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,570
Skipping a meal or two isn't a big deal.

116
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,988
Are you the one who moved me to this room?

117
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm okay with sharing a room
with the others in a big, crowded room.

118
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,379
I thought it'd be hard for your wife.

119
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,422
That's true.

120
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,634
The son-in-law truly cares
for his mother-in-law.

121
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,215
You must be happy.

122
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,513
How did you know?

123
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,351
It seems like my mother
saw you at the hospital.

124
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,024
So she knew,
but she acted like she didn't.

125
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,816
Why didn't you tell Eun-joo?

126
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,200
None of your business.

127
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,995
I was going to tell her after the surgery.

128
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,325
They will all be here soon.

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,076
If Eun-joo finds out about this,

130
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,917
she will suffer even more.

131
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,796
You used to love your son-in-law.

132
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,346
Your mother-in-law is not herself
these days because I'm sick.

133
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,896
Why do you think

134
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,280
Mom and Dad didn't tell us?

135
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,781
When Mom heard about my divorce,

136
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,698
she blamed herself, saying
the graduation from marriage

137
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,997
caused the divorce.

138
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,211
Nonsense.

139
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,091
Then will they not tell us

140
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,166
if something happens

141
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,514
because it may burden us?

142
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,261
We would eventually find out,

143
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,223
so what's the point of making it harder?

144
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,473
We have to tell them
to tell us everything.

145
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,857
The location of the tumor is bad,

146
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,277
so there's a high chance
of having an after-effect.

147
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,746
He can lose his memories again too.

148
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,582
His vision may decrease,

149
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,126
or he may suffer from paralysis.

150
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,127
I'm sure they heard the explanation.

151
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,066
We have to go see them,
so don't cry too much.

152
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,672
Does my face look okay?

153
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,401
Mom, Dad, what is this?

154
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,478
That scared me, seriously.

155
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,070
It's okay.

156
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,070
You should've told us if you were sick.

157
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,075
Where's Ji-woo?

158
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,369
The mood will lighten up
when Ji-woo is here.

159
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,044
Is he busy?

160
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,792
He wasn't home yesterday,
so I called him but didn't answer

161
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,835
He calls back right away
when he misses a call.

162
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,249
Ji-woo

163
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,337
went on a business trip.

164
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,383
When?

165
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,764
He left urgently. Urgently.

166
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,635
To where?

167
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,851
Wellâ¦

168
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,193
Where was it again?

169
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,598
He went overseas.

170
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,732
He went on a business trip overseas?

171
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,069
He's all grown-up now.

172
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,611
Then don't tell him.

173
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,115
He'll find out if he comes back,
so let him do his work.

174
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,909
He has a soft heart
and he loves his family too much,

175
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,254
so he'll rush home right away
without working.

176
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,620
Don't tell him.

177
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,794
Okay.

178
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,408
Don't worry.

179
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,536
Ms. Sook.

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,213
I'm afraid that I might

181
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,134
lose my memories again after the surgery,

182
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,680
and I'm afraid that I might not be able to

183
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,433
return this time.

184
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,603
You don't need to be scared.

185
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,233
Just forget about all the bad things

186
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,239
and fill yourself with good memories.

187
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,572
We'll go into the operating room.

188
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,066
DEPARTMENT: NEUROSURGERY
PATIENT'S NAME: KIM SANG-SIK

189
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,901
DURATION: 8 HOURS AND 41 MINUTES

190
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,247
OPERATING CENTER

191
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,375
The surgery went well.

192
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,672
The location of the tumor was unideal,
so it took a long time.

193
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,427
We tried the best we can.
Let's keep an eye on his recovery.

194
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,220
Now everything depends on the patient.

195
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,270
Thank you.

196
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,730
Thank you so much.

197
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,151
It went well.

198
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,729
It went well. That's a relief, right?

199
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,955
Mr. Sang-sik.

200
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,461
Mr. Sang-sik.

201
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,838
-Dad.
-Dad.

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,640
-Dad.
-Mr. Sang-sik.

203
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,908
Mr. Sang-sik!

204
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,280
-Code Blue for Mr. Kim Sang-sik.
-Mr. Sang-sik!

205
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,787
-Dad!
-Mr. Sang-sik!

206
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,998
Dad!

207
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,198
Mr. Kim's family,

208
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,407
-please step out.
-Mom.

209
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,747
Mom.

210
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,225
You're like a rock.

211
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,399
You can't lose to something like this.

212
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,423
When I was wandering
without a place to settle,

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,958
my first child gave me
my first family photo

214
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,092
and called me father.

215
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,810
My second child is as heartwarming

216
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,731
as the spring sun and smiles brightly.

217
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,230
My youngest child makes
my heart mellow every time I see him.

218
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,860
And the strongest

219
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,862
and loneliest person in the world.

220
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,574
My wife.

221
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,035
Mr. Sang-sik.

222
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,790
Are you okay?

223
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,577
Can you see us?

224
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,749
Dad must be awake, right?

225
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,457
Don't worry, Mom.

226
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,474
Yes.

227
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,190
They're my familyâ¦

228
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,693
whom I love.

229
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,789
He regained his consciousness,
so he needs to rest.

230
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,212
Please come again later.

231
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,539
-Let's go.
-Okay.

232
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,421
No particular aftereffect was found.

233
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,758
We have to wait
for the checkup results to see

234
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,590
if the tumor is malignant or benign.

235
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,301
Don't worry too much and get some rest.

236
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,285
Is he okay?

237
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,762
Yes.

238
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,431
He recognized all of us,

239
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,769
and that Ji-woo was missing.

240
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,604
Ji-wooâ¦

241
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,234
hasn't called yet, right?

242
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,605
No.

243
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,993
I came because I was worried.
You should go now.

244
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,323
Stay with meâ¦

245
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,252
for a moment.

246
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,167
I feel relaxed.

247
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,391
I hide my facial expressions

248
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,679
and I'm careful with my words
even to my family,

249
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,387
but with youâ¦

250
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,063
I don't feel like that at all.

251
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,320
It feels like I'm resting.

252
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,606
I was worried if I came,
I would just be another nuisance,

253
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,950
but I'm glad I came.

254
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,814
Dadâ¦

255
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,813
came to see me

256
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,015
after I miscarried.

257
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,359
Dad.

258
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,078
Don't you have work today?

259
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,912
I have to go to work now.

260
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,537
You should've come home
for a short moment at least.

261
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,625
Why are you here?

262
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,379
No, it's okay.

263
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,167
I've been working for days,
couldn't wash up,

264
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,676
and went hiking from time
to time, so I'm filthy.

265
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,972
-How's your condition?
-I'm fine.

266
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,675
Get some rest.

267
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,385
It'd be better to just quit working
and take time off.

268
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,358
I have work for the second half.

269
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,942
I'll take care of it.

270
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,617
These areâ¦

271
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,212
wild pine mushrooms found
by a true wild ginseng digger

272
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,328
who climbs the mountains
a few times a day.

273
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,956
These are really good for you.

274
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,503
And you eat them all by yourself.

275
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,795
Can you smell them?

276
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,521
-Dadâ¦
-Go inside.

277
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,574
I have to go.

278
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,442
Go inside.

279
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,163
If it was Eun-hee,
she would've thanked him,

280
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,781
hugged him right away,

281
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:18,075
and taken him home
to make him see her eating it.

282
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,383
But I didn't say anything.

283
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,377
When Dad couldn't wake upâ¦

284
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,841
that was the first thing I thought of.

285
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,706
THIS ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE

286
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,969
CEO.

287
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,561
Ji-woo's first love disappeared.
She changed her account.

288
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,765
This is a fraud.

289
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,574
INTERNATIONAL CALL

290
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,705
Hi.

291
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm sure you won't have an opening party.

292
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,309
I came in to see if you need anything,
but it's empty.

293
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:58,974
I'm about to start.

294
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,848
It seems small, doesn't it?

295
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,555
At first, I thought so too.

296
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,015
But when the desk and the items came in,

297
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,686
it was actually pretty big.

298
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,573
Are you sure you don't need anything?

299
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,702
A gift from a colleague

300
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,528
and a fellow tenant.

301
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,374
Hey.

302
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,541
Really? Okay.

303
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,129
-Chief Yoo.
-Yes, Chief Kim.

304
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,965
I don't think I can wait for the shipment
because of my family matter,

305
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,339
so please open the door
when the furniture comes.

306
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,967
Yes, of course.

307
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,521
I have tons of work these days,
so I can wait for 24 hours too.

308
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,519
Don't worry.

309
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,152
Who was it that made you
answer the phone outside?

310
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,991
A friend.

311
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,038
Ji-woo's father had surgery.

312
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,325
-Surgery?
-Ji-woo, who's out of reach

313
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,087
is on a fake business trip
when his father had surgery.

314
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,340
How long do you think this lie will last?

315
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,432
He has no money for a return ticket.

316
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,392
And he said he's too sorry to call you.

317
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,975
Let's send him money first.

318
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,640
Don't tell him about the surgery.

319
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,444
Tell him to come back right away.

320
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,079
-Can you lift your arm, please?
-Your father

321
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:49,213
won't even know that the one
taking care of him isn't his son-in-law,

322
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:53,922
but an enemy who's even worse
than a stranger, right?

323
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,915
Mom.

324
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,427
You must be relieved now.
Your language is violent.

325
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,391
I'll tell him when he gets better.

326
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,682
No.

327
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,642
I'll tell him later.

328
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,636
Later.

329
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,152
Do we have to know everything
because we're family?

330
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,271
Sick people don't need
to know some things,

331
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,648
and only those who need to know
have to know.

332
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,321
That's coming from experience.

333
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,333
By the way, about Ji-wooâ¦

334
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,911
He still hasn't called back?

335
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,155
He's coming.

336
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,042
I didn't tell him about Dad's surgery.

337
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,626
I'm going to tell him when he arrives.

338
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,301
That's coming from experience.

339
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,756
If he finds out that
his father had surgery while he was gone,

340
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,854
Ji-woo, who loves his family so much,

341
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,268
will be heartbroken.

342
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,645
Go inside and rest. Don't overdo it.

343
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,066
Why? What about the kids?

344
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,485
Let's go.

345
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,494
Mom, Dad.

346
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,078
Wait for me.

347
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,564
Please understand my mom.

348
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,018
Of course.

349
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,940
I understand.

350
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,231
By the way, why isn't Ji-woo coming?

351
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,697
Is something going on with him?

352
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,276
It's a family matter.

353
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,493
You need to stop.

354
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,000
Okay.

355
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,054
I'm leaving tomorrow.

356
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,676
Yes.

357
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,698
He said he ran into her in a game,
and I think he was tricked.

358
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,124
And he has no money
to book a return ticket,

359
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,289
so I think he got ripped off too.

360
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,883
I've been searching on social media

361
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,249
and checked it with the story
I heard from Ji-woo,

362
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,376
and it looks like he fell
for her suggestion to live quietly

363
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,715
by the lake while running
a kayak rental shop.

364
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,642
Kayak?

365
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,389
Did he like things like that?

366
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,353
I'm sorry. I should've taken
better care of him.

367
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,767
Why would a CEO take care of
a grown-up employee's privacy?

368
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,108
If you feel bad,
we feel even worse for doing this.

369
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,032
Stillâ¦

370
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,584
I'm sure he's having the hardest time.

371
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:13,408
And he must be disappointed in himself
for falling for it so easily, like a fool.

372
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,126
When he gets back to his senses
he would regret losing all the money,

373
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,038
and it might last for a long time.

374
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,262
Go home now, Seo-young.

375
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,641
I'll get going now.

376
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,818
I'll meet him first.

377
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,399
You stand behind me and buy time,
so Eun-joo can't see him.

378
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,525
If not, she'll crush Ji-woo
into pieces with her words,

379
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,488
and blow him away.

380
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,035
You seriously know less
about your family than I do.

381
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,619
I'll pretend to smash Ji-woo
as soon as I see his face.

382
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,576
Never mind. Damn it.

383
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,384
I might do that for real.

384
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,877
You bastard.

385
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,981
Hey, youâ¦

386
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,229
Iâ¦

387
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,204
Why do youâ¦

388
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,994
look like this?

389
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,708
Didn't you have any money?

390
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,132
Did you eat something?

391
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,138
I ate on the airplane.

392
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,760
Ji-woo, let's unpack your things first.

393
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,334
Mom.

394
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,244
Dad shouldnât know

395
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,792
just yet, right?

396
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,085
We said you went on a business trip,

397
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,589
so tell them later

398
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,511
when you can actually laugh

399
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,390
when you recall today.

400
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,566
I'm so sorry.

401
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,917
Are you okay?

402
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,288
Yes.

403
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,464
-Much better than before.
-Okay.

404
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,803
Much better.

405
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,458
-And this sideâ¦
-This side too.

406
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,724
I can lift it quite high.

407
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,183
Hi.

408
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,519
Ji-woo.

409
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,818
Was the business trip hard?

410
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,492
You got so skinny.

411
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,161
No.

412
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,284
Dad, are you okay?

413
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,867
Are you allowed to stand up?

414
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,872
Yes.

415
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,707
Did you miss your youngest son?

416
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,209
Of course, I missed you so much.

417
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,671
Which country did you go to?

418
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,709
Canada.

419
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,256
It's quite far away.

420
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,182
That's awesome.

421
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,845
Canada isâ¦

422
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,403
He packed all of his stuff
for a business trip?

423
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,026
How meticulous.

424
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,091
He makes himself up so much.
Who does he take after?

425
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:16,093
He looks at the mirror
longer than his sisters do.

426
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,250
Eun-hee.

427
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,550
I would've left by the time
you read this letter.

428
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,509
I didn't want to live like Dad.

429
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,848
I want to live freely
without being tied down by my family.

430
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,059
Mom, you must've been tired.

431
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,363
You must be tired. Go home and rest.

432
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,901
It's okay.

433
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,025
Mom, I'll stay here now. Go home and rest.

434
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,452
Yes.

435
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,200
You should go home and rest.

436
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,912
No, thanks.

437
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,042
I have to stay next to your dad.

438
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,083
Eun-hee,

439
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,168
by the time youâre reading this letter,
I'll have started a new life

440
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,168
in an unfamiliar country.

441
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,213
I'm not confident to live like Dad.

442
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,471
I want to live a life in which
I don't have to achieve anything.

443
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,181
I want to just live my life
floating on a kayak

444
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,182
here and there, without doing anything.

445
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:17,018
I believe you'll explain
my feelings to Mom and Eun-joo

446
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,774
and be on my side.

447
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,280
I want the three of you
to wear the same necklace.

448
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,111
When I settle down,
I'll invite all of you.

449
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,204
Let's meet again
with a smile on our faces.

450
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,008
Ji-wooâ¦

451
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,051
His world must've crumbled.

452
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,945
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

453
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,530
Dad, why don't you walk back once more?

454
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,496
I think I can move well.

455
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,003
Dad, do it five seconds each. One.

456
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,877
Two.

457
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,134
Three.

458
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,625
Four.

459
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,836
Five.

460
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,933
Now, the left foot again.

461
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,388
Left foot. Slowly.

462
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,895
-Slowly.
-I have to try and stay like this.

463
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,400
Right foot again.

464
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,072
Lower it.

465
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,651
Left foot.

466
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,876
Remember when my workload got reduced

467
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,264
and got injured working
at a construction site?

468
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:17,677
You looked after me day and night
during my long hospitalization.

469
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,846
Eun-joo was busy making
money instead of me,

470
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,017
and Eun-hee was busy looking
after Ji-woo and going to school.

471
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,147
The kids suffered a lot because of me.

472
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,276
At that time, we didn't say a word
to each other at the hospital.

473
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,911
But now, you listen to me

474
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,119
and the kids take turns to come to see me.

475
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,707
I feel so great.

476
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,012
What are you trying to say?

477
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,927
Look.

478
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,800
You're keen too.

479
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,681
I'mâ¦

480
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,898
moving into a studio apartment
when I'm discharged.

481
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,397
Have you heard of a studio apartment?

482
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,358
It has a television, a refrigerator,
and a washing machine in it.

483
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,323
I just need to move in.

484
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,113
They deliver breakfast
and do the laundry too.

485
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,948
There are lots of idiots
in the world who are like me.

486
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,245
Good grief.

487
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,344
At that timeâ¦

488
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,423
I didn't look after you with all my heart.

489
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,798
You were a truck driver,

490
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,675
but you suddenly worked
at a construction site and made a mess.

491
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,734
The insurance couldn't cover it either,
so our two daughters

492
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,559
were suffering so much,
trying to make money.

493
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,895
I cursed you a lot in my mind.

494
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,780
I'm sorry.

495
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,410
I didn't bring it out
to make you feel sorry.

496
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,790
I'm just saying that this is the happiest.

497
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:00,948
I know that

498
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,212
at the timeâ¦

499
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,960
when you were not well,

500
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,461
you lived like a sinner.

501
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,133
I know.

502
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,220
I'm a sinner.

503
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,849
I was a sinner.

504
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,601
I'm so sorry to Eun-joo and Eun-hee

505
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,606
and my heart breaks.

506
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,478
That's the right thing.

507
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,147
Both of us now

508
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,450
should stop being scared of our kids

509
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,328
and stop thinking about them.

510
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,123
Let's decide

511
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,248
after you get discharged
and recover at home.

512
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,790
We only haveâ¦

513
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,128
each other now.

514
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,929
You're saying such romantic words,

515
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,346
so you should smile.

516
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,077
Why did you come all the way here?

517
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,535
You said you have no time for me.

518
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,956
Then I should try hard
to make time for you.

519
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,764
How's Ji-woo?

520
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,256
He doesn't talk.

521
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,219
I'm angry too,

522
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,189
but I'm holding it back
since he feels worse.

523
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,936
He said I'm like his brother,
and he just left like that?

524
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,823
Once he recovers,
that little brat is dead.

525
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,530
Let's teach him a lesson together.

526
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,906
Let him be for now.
He's having a hard time.

527
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,450
I can hardly remember the last time

528
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,124
he smiled so innocently.

529
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,464
I wanted Ji-woo

530
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,253
to live his life with optimism
without getting heartbroken,

531
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,836
and I thought

532
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,421
I can make him live like that, at least.

533
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,757
This is what's disgusting about family.

534
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,354
Who do you think you are to keep him
from being heartbroken or whatever?

535
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,523
Yes, you're right, you jerk.

536
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,520
Butâ¦

537
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,606
Seriously.

538
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,992
I saw

539
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,278
his heartbroken face for the first time

540
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,787
and my heart broke.

541
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,416
Just what's the deal about being a family?

542
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,514
Isn't it obvious?

543
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,846
You hurt each other more than anyone else,

544
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,101
and when you get hurt from somewhere else,

545
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,314
they comfort you. That's what family is.

546
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,446
Don't let your parents know for now.

547
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,159
I'm so disappointed by the thought of me
being nothing to Ji-woo.

548
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,616
So if your parents find out,

549
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,365
they'll be super disappointed.

550
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,795
We need to

551
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,233
see each other every day now.

552
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,484
Okay.

553
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,530
Okay.

554
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,371
Wow, look at the menu.

555
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,039
Donât you think this is a betrayal?

556
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,752
Then did you think
I'd be drinking wine and eating ramen

557
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,714
with the trauma of divorce?

558
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,377
I heard you have malnutrition and anemia,
so I bought these.

559
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,722
They are a matching set.

560
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,141
Ji-woo, who ran away
after giving us one heck of a time,

561
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,266
gave us a matching set of necklaces.

562
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,647
It's not my style.

563
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,980
Both you and I don't
want any popping hearts.

564
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,357
There's one for Mom too.

565
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,703
So the three of us got popping hearts.

566
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,319
What about the letter?

567
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,333
I'm sure he didn't just give us necklaces.

568
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,789
It didn't say much.

569
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,415
Stop keeping it quiet
and covering things up.

570
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,711
Tell me. So we can find out
what he was thinking.

571
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,154
Eun-hee.

572
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,736
The necklace.

573
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,293
First love or kayak or whatever.

574
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,579
Let's not mention those
in front of Ji-woo,

575
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,333
even as a joke.

576
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,787
You think I'm some kind of aâ¦

577
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,955
I have enough sense to know that much.

578
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,046
He only looks sparkly on the outside.

579
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,339
I think he was mentally exhausted
at his age.

580
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,178
That's how I was at that time.

581
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,677
That's how I was at that time.

582
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,226
At least we must teach him a lesson

583
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,482
that the dream of doing nothing
is utterly ridiculous.

584
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,403
Yes, crush him into pieces.

585
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,700
Oh.

586
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,530
Tae-hyung said to take the medicine.

587
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,325
Here.

588
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,996
Are you going to keep
calling him Tae-hyung?

589
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,423
Then should I suddenly call him
Mr. Tae-hyung,

590
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,758
Dr. Yoon,

591
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,432
Mr. Yoon, and so on?

592
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,676
It's a trace of being a family.

593
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,524
I'll try and change it slowly.

594
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,857
Here.

595
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,818
I made up my mind.

596
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,031
I'm going to meet

597
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,122
my biological father.

598
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,588
Are you going to the office?

599
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,763
Your desk and furniture all came.

600
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,552
You didn't bring your car, did you?

601
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,893
You knowâ¦

602
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,935
A call from Mom.

603
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,478
MOM

604
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,399
Gosh.

605
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,481
I got a call.

606
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,196
-Mom, you're on speaker.
-Min.

607
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,529
Do you know how to see
males and females in chicks?

608
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,744
Mom, I'm a patent attorney.
I think you need a gender attorney.

609
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,708
Right. A patent attorney, yes.

610
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,959
Hey, because you're so busy,
I thought you knew how to do this too.

611
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,463
Mom, you're on speaker right now,

612
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,795
-so I'll callâ¦
-Right, Min.

613
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Your stir-fried red pepper paste
was awful.

614
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,125
It's too sweet. I told you I'd do it.

615
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,507
Mom, that's blackberry jam.

616
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,426
Hey, is that true?

617
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,057
Hey, oh, I need to try it again.

618
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,404
Mom, you're on speaker,

619
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,149
-so I'll call you backâ¦
-Honey, this isâ¦

620
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,901
Not yet! Donât mix it with the rice!

621
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,280
It's not red pepper paste.

622
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,952
It's blackberry jam.

623
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,530
Anyway, it's something sweet.

624
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,065
Anyway, I'm hanging up, okay.

625
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,996
My mother doesn't know
what a patent attorney does just yet.

626
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,213
Well, butâ¦

627
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,803
She doesn't need to know, right?

628
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,586
She loves me the most in the entire world.

629
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,099
How do you like the desk placement?

630
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,680
Yes, it'd be fine like that.

631
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,104
You saw it well.

632
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,265
You seeâ¦

633
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,853
It's the East and West,

634
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,228
and do you see
the tall buildings back there?

635
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,815
It's a small difference,
but it affects the lighting.

636
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,862
The size of the window is a bit off, butâ¦

637
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,741
So what I mean is,

638
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,794
putting the desk here
would be the most stable.

639
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,448
That's what I mean.

640
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,747
Okay. I won't move it.

641
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,383
By the wayâ¦

642
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,998
These flower pots areâ¦

643
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,378
They're my office opening gifts.

644
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,585
These plants are NASA-approved
to purify the air.

645
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:22,056
This guy is a banyan tree. Ivy. Dracaena.

646
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,388
Don't they have lovely names?

647
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,560
When you get new furniture
and paper the walls,

648
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,475
you need to ventilate well.

649
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,534
You know, there's this thing
called sick house syndromeâ¦

650
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,824
Why are you laughing?

651
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,871
You can only think of
my mom's laughter when I talk, right?

652
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,671
I told Mom that she was on speaker butâ¦

653
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,433
Patent Attorney Yoo Min-woo.

654
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,099
Congratulations. Cheer up. Be successful.

655
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,598
Hello.

656
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,432
Are you preparing
for independent publishing?

657
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,097
Yes, I am.

658
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,685
Hi.

659
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,228
LEARNING ABOUT INDEPENDENT PUBLISHING

660
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,278
Hi, everyone. This is Mr. Im Geon-joo,
who will give us a lecture

661
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,953
on independent publishing.

662
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,282
Give him a round of applause.

663
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,493
Hello.

664
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,581
What do you think
was the most disappointing

665
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,674
when I started working this job?

666
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,455
Low payment.

667
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,957
Low income!

668
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,181
That's right.

669
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,759
"Those who overcame
such a low income write books

670
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,135
and translate them too."

671
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,351
"I didnât know that, and I've been

672
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,642
reading books too easily."
I had to repent.

673
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,976
I'm sure all of you have thought of this.

674
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,653
You might've thought of quitting

675
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,111
but never ended up doing so.

676
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:01,242
And then your thoughts
reached independent publishing.

677
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,411
I wish you the best in your work.

678
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,530
-Thank you.
-Okay.

679
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,026
Thank you.

680
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,081
Eun-hee, I uncovered your plan.

681
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,669
So your dream is independent publishing?

682
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,671
No.

683
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,052
This isâ¦

684
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,758
a long-term plan.

685
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,628
I'm going to think about it
after I learn a lot more.

686
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,926
I still have a long way to go.

687
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,680
Then do you want to go to the US?

688
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,102
CHAN-PAL

689
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,733
The look on your face is saying,

690
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,654
"You're so disgustingly persistent."

691
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,782
Right?

692
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,278
Jeez, come on.

693
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,112
I'm just suggesting it
because you can apply

694
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,447
for an education program
before you quit work.

695
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,953
I'm going to stay here.

696
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,035
Did you think
I was asking you to go with me?

697
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,711
Are you going to stay here?

698
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,289
I planned to do so from the beginning.

699
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,383
Eun-hee.

700
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,585
I think I can tell you
about the week I spent with Ha-ra.

701
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,967
Breaking up wasn't just
about me wrapping things up.

702
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,517
Things we've been ignoring for years.

703
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,232
Things we couldn't say for a while.

704
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,056
We did all of them.

705
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,572
I packed her things
so she could go back to the US

706
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,241
and helped her clean up.

707
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,159
You don't need to be that specific.

708
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,079
I'm saying this
so you don't blame yourself

709
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,829
thinking that you met someone horrible.

710
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,831
I would never blame myself.

711
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,376
Good.

712
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,166
I think I'll do better

713
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,468
when I meet my new love.

714
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,510
I'm sure you will too.

715
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,064
I guess so.

716
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,215
I'll get going then.

717
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,938
MISSED CALL
CHAN-PAL

718
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,696
Hey.

719
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,575
The lecture ended just now.

720
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,871
Really? I'm on my way there.

721
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:16,915
Really?

722
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,332
Wait for a bit.

723
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,179
You're here.

724
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,927
-Was the lecture good?
-Yes.

725
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,517
-Get in.
-Okay.

726
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,078
Seriously.

727
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,286
I think I'm a natural-born driver.

728
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,670
Are you scared?

729
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,376
No. You're doing great.

730
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,102
Go slowly and step on
the brake little by little.

731
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,048
Okay.

732
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:25,979
I knew it.

733
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,488
Stopping isn't easy in any form.

734
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,945
Hey, don't say cool things
for making a mistake.

735
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,827
Slowly.

736
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,418
Chan-hyuk.

737
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,465
Yes?

738
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:55,851
When I was dating Jong-pal,
I told small lies.

739
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,140
Why?

740
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,440
That bastard is narrow-minded.

741
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,772
My life was busy
with part-time jobs at the time.

742
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,114
So whenever I had free time,

743
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,191
he would say I'm doing something
without seeing him,

744
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,411
So when I went to see a show
or a movie I wanted to see,

745
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,620
I told him I was working.

746
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,124
Yes.

747
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,794
Whenever he went to take photos with me,
you always said you were working.

748
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,705
I promised myselfâ¦

749
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,835
that I would never lie

750
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,932
if I date anyone ever again.

751
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,061
So Mr. Playboy wasn't the one.

752
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,805
The whole beginning is a lie.

753
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,556
I think not telling a lie
sounds like a lie too.

754
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,648
Isn't that too overwhelming?

755
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:52,243
Just tell me sweet lies
and heartwarming lies at least.

756
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,410
I was at the lecture today,

757
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,828
and the lecturer was the vice CEO.

758
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,083
I'm going to the lectures
for three months.

759
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,247
Yes.

760
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,587
When I ignored your call earlier,

761
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,511
we had a private conversation too.

762
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,216
I'm not going toâ¦

763
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,846
lie to you.

764
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,019
Are you sure about that?

765
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,153
"I will never lie when I date someone."

766
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,610
So you won't lie to me?

767
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,200
Yes. Think a bit more.

768
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,120
We have plenty of time.

769
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,242
Let's go.

770
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,455
I was worried thatâ¦

771
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,221
it may be super awkwardâ¦

772
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,514
and thatâ¦

773
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,810
I may feel nothing, butâ¦

774
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,476
Let'sâ¦

775
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,358
give it a shot.

776
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,700
Yes.

777
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,145
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

778
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,895
A rock can crack and break

779
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,485
as it rolls down,

780
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,660
so be a tree instead.

781
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,833
Our time of lush green leaves has passed,

782
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,502
so let's be two beautiful autumn trees
with falling leaves.

783
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,580
Ms. Sookâ¦

784
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,667
wrote a poem.

785
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,023
Read the poems Ms. Sook wrote.

786
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,444
Send Ms. Sook on a trip to the U.S.

787
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,573
Buy a house with a yard.

788
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,150
Go to a theme park with the grandkids.

789
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,106
Take a family photo.

790
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,526
Go on a family trip.

791
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,534
Put 100 million won in my bank account.

792
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,866
Exercise.

793
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,791
Learn to play the harmonica.

794
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,960
Go to a Siberian chrysanthemum festival
with Ms. Sook.

795
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,999
Go trekking to the Himalayas.

796
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,253
Go camping with Ms. Sook.

797
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,013
Thank you.

798
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,256
Hello, ma'am.

799
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,637
I'm Chan-hyuk.

800
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,064
Yes.

801
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,563
You recognized me right away.

802
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,314
I recognize you too.

803
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,106
You haven't changed.

804
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,857
You're still wonderful.

805
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,533
That way, please.

806
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,701
Okay.

807
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,948
It's been so long, right?

808
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,248
Yes, this is my first time seeing you
since Eun-joo's wedding.

809
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,706
You gave Eun-joo's wedding photo
to me separately, right?

810
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,126
The one you gave Ji-woo.

811
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,467
I love that photo.

812
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,715
Thank you.

813
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:31,351
What am I saying
with someone busy like you?

814
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,730
I wanted to thank you

815
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,232
because you are the CEO
of Ji-woo's workplace,

816
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,734
but it was too difficult, so I couldnât.

817
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,187
I've been seeing you
since I was in college.

818
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,277
It makes me sad if you say I'm difficult.

819
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,703
Please think of me as Eun-hee's friend
before Ji-woo's boss.

820
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,746
I thought it was rude
to set up this occasion.

821
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,121
I thank you for saying that.

822
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,217
Iâ¦

823
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,474
I want to be careful here,

824
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,511
so I asked you to see me.

825
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,233
Yes. Please feel free to ask me anything.

826
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,229
Did Ji-woo

827
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:23,444
really go on a business trip recently?

828
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,644
Aren't we supposed to
eat dinner with our kids?

829
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,265
Our kids are supposed to
come for my discharge.

830
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:05,606
You have to take medicine too.
You go ahead and eat first.

831
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,993
I told the kids to eat dinner
before they come.

832
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,170
Divorce?

833
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,426
Our eldest daughter has beenâ¦

834
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,007
so miserable.

835
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,232
Are you okay?

836
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,559
I was heartbroken.

837
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,556
Like you right nowâ¦

838
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,278
We can't do anything about it.

839
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:54,277
I trust our eldest daughter's choice.

840
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,666
We're always heartbroken

841
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,756
because of them,

842
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:12,257
but at the same time, we trust them.

843
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,428
Do you thinkâ¦

844
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,271
our kids are the same?

845
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,570
Do you know

846
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,111
what Ji-woo did to us?

847
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,525
He wasn't on a business trip.

848
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,421
Heâ¦

849
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,043
he just left because he hated us.

850
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:51,088
He just left without a word.

851
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,475
Mom. How's Dad?

852
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,335
I'm here.

853
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,756
How's Dad?

854
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,358
Mom, I'm here.

855
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:10,882
Mom.

856
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,917
It's a gift.

857
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,796
It's the same one I gave my sisters.

858
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,185
Mom, I'll put it on for you.

859
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,484
No, thanks.

860
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,694
Follow me.

861
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,437
Mom, light the candles on the cake.

862
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:36,898
For Dad's return home.

863
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,607
Don't do that.

864
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,774
What is family?

865
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,862
What is familyâ¦

866
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,283
to you?

867
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,084
I'm asking because I really don't know.

868
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,172
You guys don't know either?

869
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,264
Orâ¦

870
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,931
have you never thought about it?

871
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,928
When youâ¦

872
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,020
cut ties with Eun-joo,

873
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,686
I was wondering, "What happened?"

874
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,571
"Is her heart filled with hard feelings?'

875
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,744
I was worried sick alone for years.

876
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,317
Did you know?

877
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,370
When youâ¦

878
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,499
announced your divorce
without consulting me

879
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:14,917
about it,

880
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,343
I just accepted it.

881
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:24,392
And it's still breaking my heart.

882
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,595
Did you know?

883
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,943
Youâ¦

884
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,146
Do youâ¦

885
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,235
Do you even knowâ¦

886
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,868
what you have done?

887
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,811
Momâ¦

888
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:19,228
Get out.

889
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,953
Your momâ¦

890
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,826
will have nothing to do with you anymore.

891
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,621
I'm going to make her.

892
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:39,879
What isâ¦

893
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,379
family?

894
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,012
Iâ¦

895
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,473
Weâ¦

896
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,560
stillâ¦

897
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:57,939
don't know.

898
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,593
BUCKET LIST

899
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,836
Do you think the kids know?

900
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,350
Mom, I need to meet my biological father.

901
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,182
And your girl might be watching too.

902
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,614
I've always been on your side
since we were trainees.

903
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:44,074
I can smell romance from CEO.

904
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,952
I've never thought this
but today, I disliked my kids.

905
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,622
Iâ¦

906
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,700
want to leave.

907
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:04,763
