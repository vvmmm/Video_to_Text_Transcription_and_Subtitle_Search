[people chattering]

3
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,170
I like church. It's cozy.

4
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,005
Of course you do.

5
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,925
Inside are candles, red wine
and cushions. It's basically our flat.

[Jason] Erica looks well.

8
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,681
That woman's BeyoncÃ© to me, Jason.

9
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,183
Comes out of a marriage breakup stronger

10
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,352
and without once dragging me
to a yoga retreat.

11
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,895
Do you know how hard that is?

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,480
[Jason] Come on. Let's go.

13
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,069
-Why're you wearing canvas shoes?
-Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,239
Well, I--
I tried to not overthink it, all right?

15
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,867
-Then I've ended up underthinking it.
-It's not very godparenty, is it?

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,077
It's difficult to think about things
the exact right amount.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,037
Anyway, don't worry. No one will notice.

18
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,956
See you in a bit.

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,542
-You all right? [chuckles]
-Yeah, yeah, fine.

-Why is Jason wearing those shoes?
-I do not know.

-Okay, should we--
-Should we just pop inside?

22
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,804
-Yes.
-Yeah.

23

No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

[Nikki] It's too early to tell.

Everyone's hot when they're 27.

28

We won't know for sure until she's 35.

29
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,987
Yeah, what do they talk about?
What has she done?

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,448
Women under 30
don't do anything except juice.

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,159
-And tell people they're bisexual.
-Very true.

32
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,203
We're just gonna keep it simple.

33
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:03,999
People who obsess over the wedding day
are just trying to cover up the cracks.

34
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,878
Like, if the relationship's a six,
the day has to be a ten, you know.

35
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,339
-Exactly, don't overthink it. Yeah.
-Yeah.

-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,222
Doctor told me to, uh, keep a food diary
last month,

39
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,141
and I just, I really leant into it,
you know. Found my voice.

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,685
And an allergy to soy.

41
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,564
Yeah, so that's me, trying to crack
the Great American Novel for my sins.

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,650
But you're English, mate.

43
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,568
I think it gives me a unique perspective.

44
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,987
-[man] Glad you made it.
-[woman] Yeah.

45
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,405
Lovely to see you.

-Tonight.

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,583
I lasted six weeks. Erica,
I have no idea how you did 12 years.

49
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,460
Humans are resilient. Mandela did 27.

Yeah, not with Freddy he didn't.

-Hey.

57
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:28,000
Why don't we bring your girlfriend back?
Because he could do her while we're here.

58
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,418
-Can we not?
-Not what?

-[Nikki, Jason] Amen.
-Amen.

63
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,344
Freddy and Erica, do you receive
this child as a gift from God?

64
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,596
-Yes.
-Yes.

65
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,472
Do you wish to give thanks to God
and seek his blessing?

66
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,599
-Yes.
-Yes.

67
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,934
Do you acknowledge this day
that God's love is already at work?

68
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,352
Mate, we're not really religious,

69
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,647
so if you wanna just cycle forward
to the water bit, that'd be great.

70

What name have you chosen for this child?

71
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,861
-Samuel.
-Buster.

72

-What?
-Buster.

73
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,657
-His name is Samuel.
-Nope, it's not. I changed my mind.

74
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,243
You can't change your mind.
He's named after my grandfather.

Okay, guys, I'm-- I'm not sure
this is the ideal place for this.

81
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,094
I'm not naming him Sam.

82
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,055
-I'm not naming him Buster.
-[Erica] Why not?

83
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,599
Because he's not a talking bus
in a children's cartoon.

84
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,644
Yeah, this really does sound
more like a pre-font sort of chat.

85
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,812
What about a little compromise?
What about Stan?

Mm, it's just a sound really, isn't it?

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,451
John? Just-- Paul? George?
I'm just doing Beatles now.

-Parker.
-No.

93
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,663
-Why not?
-Because he's not a wealthy murderer.

Joh-- I don't-- George.

95

I'm back on Beatles again, aren't I?
Christ. Sorry.

-Amen.
-Namaste.

108
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,326
You can't rename a child out of spite.

109
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,413
Okay, you cheat on your wife,
she might rename a kid or two.

110
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,081
It is the risk that you take.

111
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,585
Actually, Nikki, from an evolutionary
perspective, monogamy is really--

112
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,838
Okay, stop. I'm-- I'm not absolving you
of your sins, okay?

Freddy, Freddy,
we've got Penny here in five,

00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,139
and I need this not to be happening, okay?

118
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,932
[Jason groans]
We're never going to find a kid.

119
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,058
-What?
-Ellie's gone.

120
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,019
-You're kidding.
-She only come on the site yesterday.

-What sort of a--
-They go so quickly!

122

It's like trying
to get Glastonbury tickets.

-This is you.
-What?

124
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,984
You took too long again.

125
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,154
Yeah, but it's difficult choosing
a child from a photograph, isn't it?

126
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,572
You wanna get in there, kick the tires.

127

-Jase.
-Um, this meeting. Is it gonna be quick?

128
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,120
What, the meeting that decides
all of our hopes and dreams

129
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,456
and defines the rest of our lives?

Yeah, it's just,
I need my stuff from Erica's,

Sorry, you want us to get it?

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,507
I just know
she's not watering my staghorn fern.

134
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,717
-Seriously, Freddy--
-Okay. All right.

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,637
Fine, we'll do it. Can you--
Can you give us a minute, please?

136
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,473
-Thank you.
-Jase.

137
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,226
His middle name is Ivan.

138

Thomas Ivan Turner.

139

His initials are "TIT."

Tit, Nikki, tit.

141
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,028
So she did name him after you then,
didn't she?

[chuckles]

143
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,493
I wish you'd back me up a bit.

144
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,995
I don't like it
when you don't dislike things I dislike.

145
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,997
You know how betrayed I felt
when you started liking olives.

146
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,667
Yeah. And I stopped eating them, didn't I?

147
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,585
For you, you little weirdo.

00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,384
Hello? Okay, all right, Penny.
Come up now. Yeah.

151
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,386
-Right.
-Do you think she's gonna tell us off

152
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,470
for not finding a child?

153
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,014
No. It takes a long time
to find the right one, doesn't it.

154
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,393
Look at me. I had hundreds of girlfriends
before I met you, andâ¦

155
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,395
Okay.

156
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,188
That sounded better in your head,
didn't it?

157
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,690
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thought so.

158
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,484
-Come on.
-[exhales]

159
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,611
I just, uh, I don't want this to slip by.

160
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,572
We need something in our lives
that's bigger than us,

161
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,116
something that will outlive us,
carry on after we've gone.

162
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,868
We will, all right?

163
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,412
We have loads of plastic bags
in our kitchen drawer.

164
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,496
[chuckles]

165
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,581
-All right?
-Yeah.

166
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,665
-Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,208
-Okay.
-[pants]

168
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,294
-Oh. Hi. [pants]
-Hello. [chuckles]

169
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,212
Is there CCTV on this street?

170
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,548
Uh, no, no.
No, I-- I don't think there is, no.

171
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,176
Oh, good, good. That's, uh--

172
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,802
No, that's good. Good, it'll be fine.

173
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,220
-[Jason] Okay.
-Okay.

174
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,680
Anyway, I only have half an hour,

175
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:56,018
because my sister and her husband are
having a naming party for her new puppy.

176
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,102
[Nikki] Aw.

177
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,606
Six months of marriage therapy,
and that's the best idea they've had.

178
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,150
I said cut to the chase,
call it "last throw of the dice"

179
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,236
'cause that's what it is. Ooh! Tea.

180
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,740
[pants] Anyway, it's gonna be
an absolute slog

181
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,783
because she has gone hard vegan.

182
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,160
-Sugar?
-Oh, no, thank you.

183
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,662
I'm sorry,
but no amount of tofu stir-fries

184
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,373
is going to un-hit that swan
with your car last summer,

185
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,084
so maybe just deal with the guilt head-on,
can we,

186
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,712
and stop burying it under
a lot of spinach triangles.

187
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,380
[Penny sips, swallows]

188
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,633
Oh, long story. He was fine.

189
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,469
It was mainly his fault. He was warned.
Right.

190
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,678
Oh.

191
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,138
Mm. [clears throat]

192
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,140
-[sighs] Gather, please.
-Oh.

193
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,852
-Okay. [chuckles]
-For I have news.

194
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,438
[whispering] I was never here.

195
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,858
This is an illusion.
This is not happening. Okay?

196
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,109
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

197
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,030
[loudly] Okay, so, there is a boy.

198
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,451
His name is James.

199
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,497
He is a nice boy.

200
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,916
-[Jason] Oh, look.
-[Nikki] Aw. [chuckles]

201
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,463
I think he's your boy. [breathes shakily]

202
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,009
By means I do not wish to divulge,

203
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,679
I have advanced knowledge
he will be on the system in 24 hours.

204
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,182
I want us to be ready to go for him.

205
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,725
James?

206
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,604
James. James Newman-Ross.

207
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,147
James Newman-Ross.

208
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,149
-"JNR." That's good. That's good.
-[chuckles]

209
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,818
Yeah. [chuckles softly]

210
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,237
Hi, hi. Uh, sorry, sorry.

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,533
Um, just to say that
she'll be doing the kids' tea from six,

212
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:39,997
so absolutely no pressure, but anytime
in the next 45 minutes would be ideal.

213
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,457
Okay?

214
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,045
[inhales]

215
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,132
-Aw, look at his little face.
-I know. Sweet. [chuckles]

216
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,383
So exciting.

217
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,307
How do we know
which of this stuff's Freddy's?

218
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,767
If you can imagine a character
in a Bret Easton Ellis novel owning it,

219
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:01,852
then it's his.

220
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,812
[items rattling]

221
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,025
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Fine.

222
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,109
Yeah?

223
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,946
-'Cause you-- you really don't need to be.
-I'm fine.

224
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,742
I have a plan for the new me.
[clears throat]

225
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,746
It's a combination of taking up running,
meditation and screwing other people.

226
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,666
-Oh. Are you dating?
-Yeah. Maybe.

227
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,168
[chuckles]

228
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,713
I don't know. It's a lot of vagina admin,
isn't it? But I could.

229
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,048
That's it. The car's full.

230
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,425
He can come and
get his bloody staghorn fern later.

231
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,887
-Does that need watering?
-It does, yeah.

232
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,027
[Nikki sighs] I can't believe
we're doing this. Have you got it?

233
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,320
[Jason] Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,827
[Nikki] Why're you wearing all that?

235
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,287
Ran out of bags.

236
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,580
Ah, thanks, Nikki.

237
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,501
Thought I'd lost that.

238
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,428
Oh, my God.
No woman would ever have two blowtorches,

239
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,557
three different sets of things
for cracking lobsters,

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,350
but no colander. [stammers]

241
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,397
-[quietly] What do you think of the flat?
-I think it's like one big panic room.

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,731
-Horrible, innit?
-Yeah.

243
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,692
So, what do you think?

244
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,193
-Gorgeous, mate.
-So lovely.

245
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,611
-Beautiful, yeah, very--
-Yeah.

246
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,198
'Cause sometimes things
can be too colorful, can't they?

247
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,283
Um, it's distracting.

248
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,993
What are you gonna do
when the kids come over, mate?

249
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,661
'Cause it is quite-- Sort of--

250
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,496
I've ordered some beanbags
off the Internet

251
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,456
and, um, uh, maybe some cushions.

252
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,375
We can sort you out
with cushions, can't we?

253
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,752
We've got 30 or 40 spare ones
in our flat you can have, mate.

254
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,087
-[Freddy] Oh!
-Jase.

255
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,882
Lobster crackers.

256
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,385
[softly] Four sets.

257
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,227
He likes football,
Nerf guns and Minecraft.

258
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,608
And his favorite food is
a chicken fajita wrap. [chuckles]

259
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,484
Oh, that makes me feel old.

260
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,904
My favorite food when I was a kid
was fish fingers and beans.

261
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,988
[chuckles] Yeah.

262
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,743
-Oi. What's the matter?
-Hmm?

263
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,037
-Nothing.
-Okay.

264
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,164
Why you being weird then?

265
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,708
I'm not. I'm acting completely normally.

266
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,001
Yeah, but that's what's weird.

267
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,754
Because normally with this sort of stuff,
you'd be all hyper.

268
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,548
-I'm fine.
-What's going on?

269
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,094
[stammers] I d-- I don't wanna say,

270
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,681
because if I tell you,
then that makes me a terrible person,

271
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,768
and not being a terrible person is
the thing that I like most about myself,

272
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,852
soâ¦

273
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,780
[sighs] Okay, I sort of assumed
that we'd be getting a girl.

274
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,574
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

275
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,868
I sort of thought that we decided that.

276
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,205
No, I didn't realize we'd decided that.

277
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,457
No, I thought that you said
that you wanted a girl

278
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,584
because
you wanted to learn how to do the--

279
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,336
What's it? The French plait thing.

280
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,171
Because the guy on the bus looked cool
when he did it.

281
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,965
The guy on the bus did look cool, but--

282
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,300
How have we not discussed this? [scoffs]

283
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,970
So, sor-- Are you--
Are you set on a girl, yeah?

284
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,764
Well, are you set on a boy?

285
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,101
I'm, no-- I-- Look, am I? [stammers]

286
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,478
If I had to choose,
then, maybe selfishly, yeah.

287
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,146
Because, you know, because there's that,

288
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,024
there's that special bond
between father and sons.

289
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,278
Oh, really? How many conversations
do you have with your dad

290
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,072
that aren't about
how to get the TV back to HDMI1?

291
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,242
Actually, loads recently,
because he's just hurt his shoulder.

292
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,202
So now I can ask him about that too.

293
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,204
Jase, I just, I-- I--
I don't understand them.

294
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,289
-Who? Who?
-Their choices.

295
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,456
Men!

296
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,166
All men? Yeah?

297
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,960
Oh, I don't know, you-- [swallows]

298
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,548
You all react weirdly to things, and
you have emotions in all the wrong places.

299
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:04,136
And you watch films that are basically
an hour and a half of fast driving.

300
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,888
You always like your hair
loads shorter than you should.

301
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,014
What are you talking about?

302
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,516
What am I supposed to do with a boy, Jase?

303
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,895
Seriously. What?
Do-- Do I fill him full of confidence,

304
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,565
or do I take some of it away because
society already fills him with confidence,

305
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,276
so if I do it too, I'm just--
I'm gonna turn him into--

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,903
-Into what?
-Freddy!

307
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,616
That is seriously the worst-case scenario?

308
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,992
Do you know, Jase, it's-- [stammers]

309
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,661
It really scares me
that you don't hate him

310
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,246
and what he's done as much as I do.

311
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,415
He's my mate though, Nikki.
What am I gonna do?

312
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,127
-And anyway, women can be dicks.
-Yeah, okay.

313
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,213
-Myra Hindley!
-Yeah.

314
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,215
That rude woman at the post office.

315
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,344
Queen Mary I.

316
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,180
Okay, three women in,
and you're back to the 16th century.

317
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,474
I could name you
five men off tonight's news.

318
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,351
But none of them are four-year-old boys,
are they?

319
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,145
Yeah, no, Jase,
but they were once and then society,

320
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,272
society just came in
and messed them all up.

321
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:01,360
How can I compete with society, Jase?
It's bloody everywhere.

322
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,071
I mean, we're the only people
that get to pick a gender.

323
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,323
Why would we not pick the best one?

324
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
Oh, have this week's rankings
come out already?

325
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,078
Sorry, I must've missed that.
This is a ridiculous conversation!

326
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,584
-Will you get the plates?
-I'm doing it.

327
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,962
Margaret Thatcher.

328
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,713
[scoffs]

329
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,168
Can I ask your advice?

330
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,919
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

331
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:04,298
Oh, my God, that is wild.
No one has ever said that to me before.

332
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,425
It's always like,
"Jen, no one asked your opinion.

333
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,218
This is my wedding. Go back to your seat."

334
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,303
Okay, umâ¦

335
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,139
But I will be honest with you, 'kay?
I won't sugarcoat it.

336
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,016
You wouldn't want me to sugarcoat it,
would ya?

337
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,518
Uh, yes, I would.
When have I ever said that?

338
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,146
-Always sugarcoat it.
-Okay, fine. Go.

339
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,523
Well, it's-- it's about boys.

340
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:25,110
Okay, they look like their worst bio photo
is a good rule of thumb,

341
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,530
and always reply to a below-the-waist nude
withinâ¦ ten minutes.

342
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,698
[woman] Hello. What can I get you?

343
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,826
Hi. Uh, two falafel wraps,
uh, one with extra pickle. Thank you.

344
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,496
Yeah, no, um, raising them,
not dating them.

345
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,417
-Do you think I could raise a good one?
-Oh.

346
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,882
-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
-Yeah?

347
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,509
-Oh, 100%.
-Okay.

348
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,552
Just don't let them be fussy eaters.

349
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,096
My friend, Clayton,
only ate toast until he was 12,

350
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,057
and now he's really into S and M.

351
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,350
It's not a coincidence.

352
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,810
Okay, yeah. No, that-- that's a handy tip.

353
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,481
And anyway, you know,
bad parents make interesting people.

354
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,273
Joel's parents divorced when he was nine,

355
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,859
and he's the most interesting person
I know.

356
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,864
I mean, we can talk for hours, like,
even when we're not high. [chuckles]

357
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,782
He does get quite angry at stuff.

358
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,661
Which is wild, 'cause I'm the lowest
maintenance person in the world.

359
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,164
I'm so low-maintenance, I might
still be going out with some people.

360
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,916
Jen, does he sound like
he's the right person for you?

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,752
Yeah, no. We're on a break at the moment.
[chuckles]

362
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,382
We couldn't agree what race Ariana Grande
was, and it all just sort of spiraled.

363
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,342
-[woman] There you go, ladies. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

364
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,635
Thank you. [chuckles]

365
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,470
Mm. [inhales]

366
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:37,808
Basically, just fill them with love,
and it'll be fine. [chuckles]

367
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,977
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. [chuckles]

368
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,979
[chuckles] Oh, but not too much.

369
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,231
'Cause then they get too close
and resent all other women

370
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,524
for not being as good.

371
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,943
It actually happens a lot
with serial killers.

372
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,696
Did you see that one in South Korea?
He was really handsome,

373
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,781
which you don't really expect
in a murderer, do you?

374
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:53,907
No.

375
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,203
Has this helped?

376
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,582
Yeah. Massively.

377
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,166
Cool. [chuckles]

378
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,307
[sighs] Look, are we gonna talk about this

379
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,309
or just keep pretending
you wanna buy sunglasses?

380
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,519
I do maybe wanna buy some sunglasses.

381
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,062
There you go.

382
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,939
I like to have a choice.

383
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,193
Look, who says that our boy is gonna
be boyish anyway?

384
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,111
He might not be.

385
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,239
Gender norms are ingrained, Jase.

386
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,949
Erica bought Lauren a monster truck.

387
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,619
She put it in a dress
and pushes it around in a buggy.

388
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,746
I'm not sure how scientific
some of your arguments are.

389
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,623
So what if a monster truck
wants to wear a dress?

390
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,917
Good luck to him. Her. They.

391
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,129
I wanna be a guide to our child.

392
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,674
I wanna be wise, and offer help
and smooth their path.

393
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,636
How can I do that if I don't know
what it's like to be a boy?

394
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,262
You'd expect me to do that for a girl.

395
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,181
Yeah, because girls
tell you what they're feeling.

396
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,849
-They know how to ask for help.
-Do you? Bollocks.

397
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,559
You just sit on the sofa
hugging a cushion,

398
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,978
sighing louder and louder
until someone asks you what's wrong.

399
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,439
Boys are uncomplicated, okay?

400
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,442
They're just, you know, bosh,
straight lines.

401
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,902
It's like maintaining a bit of machinery.

402
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,363
Bit of a wipe down with a damp cloth
now and then, they're golden.

403
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:18,158
-Oh, wow, another worrying opinion.
-Oh, hello, mate.

404
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,952
-Hello.
-How are you?

405
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,371
Haven't seen you in ages.
What you been up to?

406
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,206
-No staghorn fern?
-Sorry, come again?

407
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,084
-You didn't bring my staghorn fern.
-No, we couldn't fit it in.

408
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,002
Yeah, well, could you pop back and get it?

409
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,296
-[scoffs, chuckles]
-[chuckles]

410
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,217
-Are you actually being serious?
-Yeah, well, I've had it since uni.

411
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,679
We spent yesterday afternoon
moving all of your stuff.

412
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,348
Not all my stuff,
'cause I am light one staghorn fern.

413
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,432
Wow.

414
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,227
Go and get it yourself then.
We're not your interns, Freddy.

415
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,312
I can't. Me and Erica aren't talking.

416
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,648
We've got lots of stuff on ourselves,
okay?

417
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,444
And to be honest, mate, you're acting
like a bit of a selfish dick.

418
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,821
You think I'm selfish?

419
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,156
I once saw you
unplug a cafÃ©'s Christmas lights

420
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,826
-so you could charge your phone.
-Oh, come on! For a quick bump.

421
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:01,952
There were four people--

422
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,163
Freddy, you're being a dick. Okay?

423
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,041
I thought you were a dick
when I first met you, but I thought,

424
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,043
"No, it's all right.
Everyone's a dick in their 20s."

425
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,628
But then when you were
still a dick in your 30s,

426
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,840
I thought, "He's under a lot of pressure.
He's got a new baby."

427
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,676
And let's face it, you know, Erica's not,
you know, warm as toast, is she?

428
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,927
But you are still being a dick,

429
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,139
and there comes a point where you're not
acting like a dick anymore,

430
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,599
you're just a dick.

431
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,268
I'm not the sort of dick
who walks away from someone

432
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,395
because he's being a dick,
but you do need to be careful, Freddy,

433
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,980
because there are not that many of us left

434
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,274
and you've already thrown one of us away.

435
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,358
Okay?

436
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,029
-Nikki, can you call Erica, please?
-Yeah.

437
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,489
You, follow me.

438
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,004
-Are you two all right?
-Yeah, why?

439
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,341
-You don't need to talk?
-About what?

440
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,510
You just had an argument.

441
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:00,594
When?

442
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,555
-[chuckles] Look at this.
-What? What?

443
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,932
[both chuckle]

444
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,267
-[Freddy] Uh-oh.
-[chuckles] That looks very sore.

445
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,144
-[Freddy] I know, right?
-[chuckles]

446
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,939
-Oh. Hello, hello.
-Hello.

447
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,857
One staghorn fern.

448
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,944
Thanking you.

449
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,322
-Okay, then.
-Mm-mmm. Hang on. Wait, please.

450
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,406
-What?
-Please.

451
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,991
The kids think
they can get us back together.

452
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,494
No, not back together,
just able to talk, all right?

453
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,871
I'm having enough trouble
getting my own family

454
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,831
without keeping your one functioning too.

455
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,918
Okay, so this is neutral ground.
It's halfway between where you both live.

456
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,963
Well, no, technically the canal
would be exactly halfway between.

457
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,340
I'm assuming no one
wants to go in there, all right?

458
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,259
So in that case,
let's do this on dry land.

459
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,052
-Do what exactly?
-Just sort it out!

460
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,556
Please! Sort it out for--
for, um, Lauren andâ¦

461
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,640
-Thomas.
-Thomas!

462
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,143
[sighs] Okay, fine.

463
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,439
We need to talk about childcare.
You have got to take more responsibility.

464
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,234
-Um, I've been babysitting.
-You have babysat twice,

465
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,862
and anyway, it's not even called that
when they're yours.

466
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,114
-Have you been watering this?
-My God.

467
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,740
I've had this since uni.
I don't want it neglected.

468
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,993
You've had her since uni too
and you've neglected her, soâ¦

469
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,369
That's a fair point, mate, yeah.

470
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,329
It's weird, the love affair
you've got with that plant.

471
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,998
It's not weird. It's special.

472
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,252
It's been there through everything.

473
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,175
[inhales] All right. Fine.

474
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,803
-[Nikki] What are you doing?
-Freddy! What are you playing at?

475
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,388
-What are you doing?
-Freddy!

476
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,808
-No, you are right. It is just a plant.
-You can't just chuck it away!

477
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,435
-Why?
-Because it's part of our family.

478
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,436
But you hate it!

479
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,314
I can hate something
and I can still be sad when I lose it!

480
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,401
Oh, f--

481
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,362
-[Nikki] Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

482
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,531
-What are you doing, Erica? Shit!
-[Nikki] Oh!

483
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:46,909
-Freddy!
-No!

484
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,787
-Ah!
-Okay, come back! Just come back!

485
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,289
I can't. She needs me!

486
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,583
-Don't die, Erica. I'm coming.
-Freddy, I've got it.

487
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,920
-What are you doing?
-Backstroke is my best stroke!

488
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,087
I can't see you.

489
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,464
Help him!

490
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,008
I'm gonna stay here and watch their stuff.

491
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,635
Mate, I'm gonna stay up here
and watch your stuff.

492
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,470
-Okay! Thank you!
-Jason!

493
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,556
What? It's a-- That's a very expensive
jacket. Very expensive jacket.

494
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,726
Where are you? Where are you?
I'm coming. I'm coming. I've got you.

495
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,853
[murmuring]

496
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:17,064
Oh, my God! [spits]
I swallowed a lot of water.

497
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,066
[grunts] Come on. Oh!

498
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,193
-Oh, my God, there's a boat! Guys!
-[Erica screams]

499
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,277
-There's a boat!
-Oh, my God!

500
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,820
-There's a boat, guys!
-Oh, my God!

501
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,282
Okay, all right! Okay, okay, okay!
Stand up! Stand up, both of you!

502
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,867
Just stand up!

503
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,245
Oh.

504
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,708
-How do?
-Hiya!

505
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,588
-[Jason] Hello, mate.
-You all right? Hi!

506
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,933
[Erica] Okay.
Yeah, that would be really helpful.

507
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,060
[Jason] Look at him. He's like a new man.

508
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,896
-[Nikki] Yeah, thanks to you.
-I dunno.

509
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,525
I just sort of always assumed
that I'd be good in a crisis.

510
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,110
When I was young,
I used to wanna be a fireman.

511
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,194
-Yeah?
-Mm.

512
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,698
-I think you'd make a good fireman.
-Do you think so?

513
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,826
Waiting outside, watching all their stuff
while they're inside fighting fires.

514
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,411
[chuckles]

515
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,417
[Erica] Yeah. Saturday would be great.

516
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,794
Maybe a boy would be good.

517
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,588
Yeah?

518
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,799
I thought the world
turned us all into monsters.

519
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:27,134
Yeah, it has.

520
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,762
So maybe the world needs one raised by us.

521
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,307
Yeah?

522
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,559
Yeah.

523
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:42,232
-James Newman-Ross. That is good.
-It is.

524
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,321
Come on.

525
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,161
"Excuse me, Doctor. My son, James,
has got blocked sinuses."

526
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,455
"Hi, I'm James's mum.

527
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:00,125
I think we might have met
at the school fair." Yeah, I like that.

528
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,753
"James is bloody shoplifting again.
I just can't get through to him."

529
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,005
Okay, well, don't ruin it.

530
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,925
-Still sounds good though.
-[Jason chuckles]

531
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,219
-Cheers. Bye.
-Thanks.

532
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:14,473
[woman singing]

533
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,107

534
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,735
Go, go, go.
