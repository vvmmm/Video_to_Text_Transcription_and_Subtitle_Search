1
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,048
Ah! There's Princess
Dawn and Terry with the

2
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:34,749
Blooney Looney soldiers
protecting them.

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,414
Oh, Terry, look!
Here comes the Grump.

4
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:45,795
Yeah! And looks like he's going to
shoot some darts at our balloon.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,911
Well, if they think king blooney's gas
bag guards can protect them from me.

6
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,195
We got another thing coming.

7
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,428
Okay! When I get the signal,
we'll make our move.

8
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,868
This will fix him.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,224
Okay.
Everybody up!

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,843
Oh, Terry, I'm frightened.

11
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:10,208
Isn't there some way
we can fight back?

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,414
I'd better do something,
and quick. Here he comes again.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,161
I'll show them they
can't outsmart me.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,440
Maybe if I can put these two stove
pipes together it just might work.

15
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,843
Oh boy!
It's working great.

16
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:31,904
Old grump has turned around
he's heading the other way.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,004
Come on, dragon,
step on it, step on it!

18
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:38,253
Before we get our
pride puncture.

19
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,695
Faster! Faster!

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,340
Uh-oh. old Grump
hasn't given up yet.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,675
Hey sergeant,
what do we do now?

22
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,317
We all hide in that cloud.

23
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:11,611
The boys and I have a surprise
planned for Mr. Grump.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,892
Faster dragon, faster.
We got him cornered in that cloud.

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,172
Oh, you dumb-dumb, you.

26
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,757
Hey, maybe that knocked some
sense into Grump's head.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,870
No I don't think so.
Because here he comes again.

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,577
Ah! Getting tricky with clouds, eh?

29
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,626
Well, let's see how
they like my cloud.

30
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,713
Of sleeping gas that is.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,801
Quick, Terry. do something.
It's sleeping gas.

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,785
<i>This fan ought to do it.</i>

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,150
You could keep your
sleeping gas, Grump.

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,307
He's blowing it back on us.

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,805
Stop, dragon.
Whoa! look out!

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,621
Wait, wake up dragon,
wake up, wake up.

37
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,735
Do something, stupid.

38
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:38,335
No long, Dragon.
I'll bail out.

39
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,525
Geronimo!

40
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,542
Don't guess on me,
you dumb-dumb.

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,786
That stupid dragon.

42
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:18,552
Oh, dear. Terry, look!
The Blooney Looneys.

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,215
Well, they'll be okay.
The way they're drifting by the time,

44
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,800
they wake up they'll be back
in Blooney Looney land.

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,222
Look princess. I wonder what
kind of place that is up ahead.

46
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:37,229
<i>I don't know.</i>

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,965
Hey, maybe this is
where we'll find the

48
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,369
Cave of the Whispering
Orchids and the Crystal Key.

49
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,107
- Oh, I sure hope so, Terry.
- Let's have a look around.

50
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,881
I wonder where
this road goes.

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,119
<i>It goes to the village.</i>

52
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,633
Who said that?

53
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:05,499
I did!
I'm farmer Jack.

54
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:08,381
Welcome to Jack-in-boxia.

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,665
I'm pleased to meet you.

56
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,600
I am princess Dawn and this
is my friend Terry, and uh...

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,104
Where's Bip?

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
Oh, he must be out
playing somewhere.

59
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,658
Gosh! Is everybody
a jack in the box?

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,137
Of course. That's what
makes this Jack-in-boxia.

61
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,814
- Goodbye now.
- What do we do now, Terry?

62
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,919
Maybe we'd better deflate the
balloon and drive to the village.

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,650
Maybe someone there will
have more time to talk.

64
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,439
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

65
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,180
Ao this is the village?
It's kind of different isn't it?

66
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,253
You can say that again.

67
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,611
I wonder if there's
anybody around.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,227
I'll find out.
Hello!

69
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,337
Farmer Jack send us.

70
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,755
For Farmer Jack?

71
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:31,311
I'm officer jack and over
there is store keeper Jack.

72
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,972
Hi there, friends.

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,972
You cal me, Jackie.

74
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:42,149
I'm seward Jack.
Do you know what I mean?

75
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,377
You know who I am.

76
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:47,039
And my name isn't Jack.
You know what I mean?

77
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,427
Can any of you folks
tell us where we might

78
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:51,253
find the Cave of the
Whispering Orchids?

79
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,648
We're sure it's where Grump
is hidden the Crystal Key.

80
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,914
And we must find it to save my
country from the curse of gloom.

81
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,166
Speaking of Grump,
I wonder where he is.

82
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,721
Keep your eyes peeled dragon, they
must be around here somewhere.

83
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,022
You know, Terry. I get the feeling
that Grump isn't too far away.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,470
Yeah, we've got to keep
a sharp lookout for him.

85
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:21,252
Look out? look out?
All lookouts hear this.

86
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,306
Get up there and
look out for uh, uh...

87
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,215
What was her name again?

88
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,538
- Uh, Grump and his dragon.
- And his dragon.

89
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,124
They're going, you look outs.

90
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,924
No sign of Grump.
Two o'clock an noise while.

91
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:49,731
All work here.
Still two o'clock and all's well.

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,635
What was that up ahead there?

93
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,056
I saw some,
faster, dragon.

94
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,736
Oh-oh! It's not all's well.
No matter what time it is.

95
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,938
Run for your life!
It's the Grump with his dragon!

96
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,172
Ah-ha! Did you hear that, dragon?
We got him this time.

97
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,499
<i>He's here.
The Grump is here!</i>

98
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,922
Ah-Ha! There we go.
After them, dragon.

99
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,621
Whoa!

100
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,818
Why you no-good
sneak jack.

101
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,155
Wherever you are,
come back here!

102
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:48,086
Shh! We are sleeping down here.

103
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,277
You smart alley jack.
So you gonna sush me?

104
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,261
You hear?
Well, say something down there.

105
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,656
Look, Terry.
Mr. Grump is really getting it.

106
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,392
Yes and he really deserves it too.

107
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,244
Hey sporty jack,
how about a game of tennis?

108
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,686
<i>Okay, I'll serve.</i>

109
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,564
Oh stop it!
Take it easy! Hold it! Whoa!

110
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,567
Watch fellas, easy now.
Don't you guys haven't missed?

111
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:24,762
I might have taken a coffee break.

112
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,873
Well, when Grump is busy playing
tennis we might as well take off.

113
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,121
Okay, Terry.
Bye, everybody.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,459
- Goodbye, friends.
- Good luck.

115
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,176
Bon voyage.

116
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,143
Gee, it was sure nice the
way they helped us out.

117
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:43,106
It sure was.

118
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,858
Oh, by the way,
which way are we headed?

119
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,677
In a direction as far away
from Grump as we can get.
