FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,864
I SHARED THE PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

4
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,279
I also had a great time.
I wish you good luck!

5
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,608
That soulless encouragement is habitual.

6
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:17,538
Thistle, stay happy.

7
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,748
Stay happyâ¦

8
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,575
Is it too abstract?

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,874
THISTLE, STAY HAPPY

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,997
Whatever. Just send it.

11
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,591
E-MAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,012
MOM

13
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,806
Seriouslyâ¦

14
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,768
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,563
Yes, I'll be there before 9:00.

16
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,494
MOM

17
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,203
What's wrong with her?

18
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,456
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

19
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,095
You have received a call from Mom.

20
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,814
Jeez, this old womanâ¦

21
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,694
Ms. Lee Jin-sook, good morning.

22
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,105
Why weren't you picking up?

23
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,863
Don't call me in the morning.

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,695
I'm busy getting ready for work.

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,370
"Don't call me in the morning."

26
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,908
"Or during a meeting."

27
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,292
"Or when I'm eating lunch."

28
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,448
"Or when working late."

29
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,196
Then when should I call you?

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,958
You should call me back
if you missed my call!

31
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,417
Do you think I called you
because I'm bored?

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,957
I call much less than other moms.

33
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,336
I will never call you again!

34
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,060
Hasn't her menopause passed already?

35
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,982
Why is she always yelling at me?

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,850
Why are you yelling at her?

37
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,766
Got any aged kimchi?

38
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,153
That's the last aged kimchi
we have from two years ago.

39
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,284
If you need more,
mix the kimchi from last year.

40
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,239
But you don't like mixing them.

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,158
Jeez.

42
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,832
Forget it.

43
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,918
Tell the kids today.

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,711
Don't play dumb with me.

45
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,546
Do as you wish.

46
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,343
Okay. Fine.

47
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,519
Dad, which mountain
are you going to today?

48
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,816
-Mountains are all the same.
-Have a safe trip.

49
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,821
What?

50
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,993
I'm working part-time
and about to get hired full-time.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,790
I can't stand on my own feet.

52
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,297
Mom, I can see you burning
with rage from behind.

53
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,507
Who was it?

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,216
Who made you angry? Who did it?

55
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,977
Call Eun-hee and tell her
to come home in the evening.

56
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,140
I have something to say.

57
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,478
Eun-hee seemed to be
working late recently.

58
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,323
Tell her to come anyway.

59
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,359
Say she's not family if she doesn't come.

60
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,026
Jeez.

61
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,033
YOUNGER DAUGHTER

62
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,246
-The caller cannot be reachedâ¦
-So you're upset, right?

63
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,336
What? Is something going on at home?

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,250
Why?

65
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,337
Both you and Mom have been
calling like crazy since morning.

66
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,513
Was Mom talking to you
on the phone earlier?

67
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,932
Yes. You heard it too, right?

68
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,978
She was yelling at me on my way to work.

69
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,151
Whatever. Mom says
to come home in the evening.

70
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm busy.

71
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,978
She said you should come,
regardless of the time!

72
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,737
She said you're not family if you don't!

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,780
It looks like she has something to say.
Just come. She's never been like this.

74
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,237
Do you not know what's going on?

75
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,825
No, not at all.

76
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,171
-Is Eun-joo coming too?
-I don't know.

77
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,846
Mom, see you in the evening.

78
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,310
LOVE

79
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,390
YOON TAE-HYUNG FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC

80
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,193
We'll return after listening to

81
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,946
"Mozart's Concerto
for Flute and Harp, Movement 3."

82
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,094
I told you to take it to the cleaners.

83
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,511
I have it washed
at the laundromat and I just pick it up.

84
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,221
The laundromat is the best place
to read books.

85
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,636
I have nothing to do either.

86
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,812
You're writing something every day.

87
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,689
I'm looking forward to it.

88
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,648
Goodness.

89
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
I told you I'm not writing anything.

90
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,192
But I heard about it.

91
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,492
About what?

92
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
From who?

93
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,204
You heard it from Hyo-seok, right?

94
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,041
I'm just having fun alone

95
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,212
using my computer at the cafe.

96
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,919
Hyo-seok?

97
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,127
You call a cafe part-timer

98
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,712
near your house by his name?

99
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,168
He's a kid.

100
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,257
You're not jealous, are you?

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,600
Barista Ahn is not a kid, is he?

102
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,441
Hello.

103
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,811
-Hi.
-Hi.

104
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,734
Right. Mom's coming today.

105
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,316
I'm having dinner with her today.

106
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,151
Okay. See you at the cafe.

107
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,736
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

108
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,788
How could I see it as jealousy
and ask him about it?

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,473
TEAM LEADER KIM EUN-HEE
THREE MINUTES LATE

110
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,719
Seriously.

111
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,929
If I didn't send the email

112
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,136
and the emoticon in the car,

113
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,555
I wouldn't have been late.

114
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,273
-Good morning.
-Hi.

115
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,153
-Hi.
-Yes, hello.

116
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,150
Small things can build up
to something big.

117
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,153
Even if you're a few minutes late,
the fine is still the same.

118
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,406
I don't want to have a get-together
with the fine you paid.

119
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,621
Thank you for your
kind words this morning.

120
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,081
Darn it!

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,829
Darn it!

122
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,003
Good morning.

123
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,004
-Darn it.
-Goodness.

124
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,006
What a lunatic.

125
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,048
Our CEO's explosive disorder
is going on too long.

126
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,393
The US headquarters is sending a Vice CEO.

127
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,140
He's younger than CEO Jung,
but I heard he's super competent.

128
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,854
That rumor about him aiming
to take CEO Jung's place.

129
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,806
Anyway, frowning won't change your life.

130
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,648
You'll just get more wrinkles, right?

131
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,784
Wrinkles.

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,360
I like your quote today.

133
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,855
All right, let's work.

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,330
-Rolling.
-It's light.

135
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,909
I've been so curious about it.

136
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,044
-Popular people these daysâ¦
-Cut!

137
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,621
Is it just me
or is she not pulling it off?

138
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,207
She'sâ¦

139
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,591
a bit bland.

140
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,749
Is that my fault?
I know things are tough right now,

141
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,167
but can we use an actress?

142
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,506
No, we have no money.

143
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,550
Act like you're talking to us.

144
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,184
Just do as you wish.

145
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,891
-Just do it. You can do it.
-Ready.

146
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,274
Rolling. Action!

147
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,063
Put on your basic makeup!

148
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,233
I'll open it.

149
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,516
My second older sister
might come home this evening

150
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,357
and I'm going to tell her I work here.

151
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,032
-Donât. I'll tell her.
-What?

152
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,282
-Do you keep in touch with my sister?
-No.

153
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,414
Even if we haven't been in touch,
we're still friends on chat.

154
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,582
Social media notifies me on her birthday.

155
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,711
-I can contact her whenever I want to.
-I see.

156
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,130
If you didn't want to contact her
for a long time, then don't.

157
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,384
How long has it been?

158
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,551
Five by number of years, four by duration.

159
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,795
Have I been counting that?

160
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,006
Yes, it's nice.

161
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,266
It must've cost a lot to build.

162
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,518
My goodness.

163
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,770
Gosh, my knee.

164
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,097
-Hello.
-Hello.

165
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,478
Ma'am, this place
is so serene and beautiful.

166
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,358
There would be no problem
meditating in a place like this.

167
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,778
-I brought some materials as references.
-Okay.

168
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,987
Who's doing the meditation
experience tomorrow?

169
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,907
Yes, I will do it.

170
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,166
I'll be 29 soon,
and that age brings bad luck, so I must--

171
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,709
This is not the place to relieve bad luck.

172
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,133
-Okay.
-The promotional filming team

173
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,383
is coming tomorrow too,

174
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,335
so the meditation will be very difficult.

175
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,761
That experience will also
help you understand the book.

176
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,006
Okay.

177
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,435
Eun-joo has become more minimalistic.

178
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,698
It's nice though because it's big.

179
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,532
I'm sure nothing lasts in this house.

180
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,200
This doesn't look like a house
for a person to live in.

181
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,260
Here's a freshly brewed coffee delivery.

182
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,517
-I don't drink coffee.
-What?

183
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,982
Didn't you start drinking it?

184
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,527
I'll drink it.

185
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,904
But how did you know?

186
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,821
You said you're going to hold back
every time I brewed coffee.

187
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,326
But you declared you'll eat
whatever you want

188
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,199
starting today.

189
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,834
So I carefully brewed it with new beans.

190
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,847
It's good.

191
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,597
It's really good.

192
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,230
I quit this for years?

193
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,599
I really am stubborn.

194
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,194
You knew I'd come, right?

195
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,446
You brought this to lend it to me, right?

196
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,318
Return it within a month.

197
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,828
I don't like people
who never return my books.

198
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,698
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,456
Did you tell him
that we meet here sometimes?

200
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,707
To Dr. Yoon?

201
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,625
Dr. Yoon?

202
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,931
Isn't that what everyone calls him?

203
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,101
Right.

204
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,889
Did you tell Dr. Yoon?

205
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,265
Was this placeâ¦

206
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,901
supposed to be a secret between us?

207
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,397
Was the laundromat such a secretive place?

208
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,384
Yes.

209
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,496
You're here.

210
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,797
Why is a doctor's wife always at
the laundromat or cleaning the hospital?

211
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,972
What's in your head to say
ridiculous words like "doctor's wife"

212
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,763
without thinking through?

213
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,846
-You need to think.
-Sure, whatever.

214
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,140
Why did you make kimchi all of a sudden?

215
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,977
Tae-hyung loves fresh kimchi.

216
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,482
-What about the laundry?
-It takes a while.

217
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,356
Youngest.

218
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,942
Go get your sister's laundry.

219
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,237
Me?

220
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,116
How can I bring it?
I don't know what's in her laundry.

221
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,369
Of course, you do.

222
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,001
It'll be nothing but hospital bed sheets,
nurse uniforms, and doctor's gowns.

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,460
Go get it now.

224
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,120
She said it takes a while.

225
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,338
Well, do I get some pocket money for this?

226
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,469
Get going.

227
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,483
-Do you two sleep in separate rooms?
-Yes.

228
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,275
Why?

229
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,664
It's what people do now.

230
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,333
How can you get pregnant
in separate rooms?

231
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,577
You'll be 40 soon.

232
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,424
Living with him alone
can be fun in its own way.

233
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,301
-Start seeing a doctor again.
-No.

234
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,224
Tae-hyung agrees with me.

235
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,755
If neither of us wants it,
then it's right to stop.

236
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,354
A married couple must have a child.

237
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,600
-Without a childâ¦
-Stop it.

238
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,770
Is that the only thing you care about?

239
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,692
Without a child, there's no married love.

240
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,072
You and Dad have three kids, but what's
so great about your married love?

241
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,160
Is staying together because of your kids
that great of married love?

242
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,418
You always say things so harshly.

243
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,149
Eun-joo.

244
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,058
It's the laundromat right below, right?

245
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,543
Didn't I bring it back perfectly?

246
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,672
Is Dad still only hiking these days?

247
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,304
Wellâ¦

248
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,144
His work is on and off,
so he just spends more time hiking.

249
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,265
His thighs got muscular like a horse.

250
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,692
He's going to the Himalayas next year.
Isn't he going too far?

251
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,560
He can go if he wants to.

252
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,438
Eun-joo.

253
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,238
I work part-time at Chan-hyuk's company.

254
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,491
-Who?
-Donât you know Chan-hyuk?

255
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,320
You knowâ¦

256
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,198
He used to come to our house
with Jong-min back in university.

257
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,789
You mean that goofy guy?

258
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,917
Is Chan-hyuk goofy?

259
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,046
It seems like Chan-hyuk liked you.

260
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,170
Youâ¦

261
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,182
You're dumb and slow-witted.

262
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,339
-What did I do?
-That's enough. Stop it.

263
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,216
Anyway,

264
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,814
Eun-hee and Chan-hyuk
haven't been in touch for five years.

265
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,231
So?

266
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,649
You and Eun-hee
became estranged at that time.

267
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,896
Five years?

268
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,694
Time flies.

269
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,067
So ten years won't take long.

270
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,494
So make up with Eun-hee and--

271
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,583
Why do you care?

272
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,078
That's between them.

273
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,080
But it's uncomfortable for us.

274
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,792
You're assembling a family meeting

275
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,542
but you have to see them separately.

276
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,376
Family meeting?

277
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,789
Let's talk when Tae-hyung comes.

278
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,384
One iced Americano for him
and I'd like my usual.

279
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,718
I'll bring them to you.

280
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,357
He looks young. Is he the owner?

281
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,741
He works part-time in the evening.

282
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,196
Do you come here often?

283
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,659
In the evenings usually?

284
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Who's Mom talking to on the phone?

285
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,874
Are you changing the subject?

286
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,874
What?

287
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,501
We're family,

288
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,791
but I just can't understand you or Mom.

289
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,878
Look.

290
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,302
Mom's smiling brightly.

291
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
What?

292
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,094
You're right.

293
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,679
Do you want anything?

294
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,475
No, thanks. I can't sleep
when I drink coffee in the evening.

295
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,113
Ma'am, I made chamomile tea for you.
It has no caffeine.

296
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,834
Tae-hyung.

297
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,042
Tae-hyung?

298
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,167
-Hello.
-We had dinner.

299
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,342
I had dinner, too.

300
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,707
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

301
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,376
What do you want to drink?

302
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,625
The roasted coffee beans
today are Ethiopian.

303
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,717
Doctor Yoon, you don't like bitter coffee.

304
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,267
Taste Ms. Kim's coffee before you decide.

305
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,357
Yes, it's okay.

306
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,365
Hello?

307
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,081
Anybody home?

308
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,512
Gosh, this smell.

309
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,552
It smells like rotten dog food.

310
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
The lights are on.

311
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,308
He said this room was his now,

312
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,648
but turned it into a storage room.

313
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,938
Is there any fruit wine?

314
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,798
THE YOO'S THAT STUDY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

315
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,915
VOLUNTEER COORDINATION

316
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,843
Mom?

317
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,507
Who are you?

318
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,984
I heard there's no one home.

319
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,689
Stop there for now! Don't move.

320
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,981
Who are you?

321
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,034
Good grief. I'm from the realtor's office.

322
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,898
Your mother put this house up for sale.

323
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,146
You didn't know?

324
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,025
Call your mother.

325
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,914
-My mom put the house up for sale?
-Yes.

326
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,788
Mom, is the house for sale?

327
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,094
They said it isn't easy
to sell a house nowadays.

328
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,208
Did someone come?

329
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,045
Let them see the house.

330
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,419
Why did you suddenly
put the house up for sale?

331
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,587
Mom?

332
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,057
What do you mean
you put the house up for sale?

333
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,349
Did Dad mess up again?
Did he cause big trouble?

334
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,113
I'm going to part ways with your father.

335
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,623
What?

336
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,199
You mean you're getting a divorce?

337
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,000
Eun-joo, what do you mean divorce?

338
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,120
-Don't overreact.
-She wants to split up.

339
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,881
That means divorce.

340
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,302
It's not a divorce.

341
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,920
They call it graduation from marriage.

342
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,758
I'm going to do that.

343
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,723
I see.

344
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,013
Graduation from marriage?

345
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,467
Do you think my decision is funny?

346
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,903
Does Dad know?

347
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,809
Is your Dad the one you're worried about?

348
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,517
Because he's involved, too.

349
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,607
At any rate, both of you are doing it.

350
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,783
So talk to him first

351
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,781
-before consulting us.
-Yes.

352
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,413
I consulted him and he agreed,

353
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,751
so we don't need your opinions.

354
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,292
If you don't need our opinions,
why did you assemble a family meeting?

355
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,686
Tae-hyung, even if you feel uncomfortable,

356
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,358
you're family too, so I thought
you should hear it together.

357
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,896
Yes.

358
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,109
Your father told me to sell the house,
take half of the money, and move out.

359
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,155
What's Dad going to do?

360
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,243
It's not my problem.

361
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,747
He told me to tell all of you

362
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,631
and went hiking.

363
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,208
How irresponsible.

364
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,713
It means he doesn't want it.

365
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,335
Dad doesn't want to
graduate from marriage.

366
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,671
Do you think I decided this
over a few days?

367
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,127
Have you thought of
how much I would've contemplated?

368
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,008
I can't do it if your Dad says no?

369
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,215
Let's say you split the house in half

370
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,135
and live on your own.

371
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,274
How will you support yourself every month?

372
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,650
Did Dad say he'll give you
half of the living expenses too?

373
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,648
-Stop that!
-Stop that!

374
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,228
Stop sighing.

375
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,743
Mom, you'll be 60 soon.

376
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,950
-People live up to 100 nowadays.
-Don't worry.

377
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,487
I can support myself.

378
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,784
Whether I wash the dishes

379
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,657
or work at a supermarket, I can manage.

380
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,834
I won't ask any of you for money.

381
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,293
You stayed home all your life.
How will you manage?

382
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,504
Why can't I? What do you know about me?

383
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,424
Why do you keep getting angry?

384
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,053
Can't I even ask?

385
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,260
Should I just say yes?

386
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,719
Lower your voice.

387
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,049
Yes.

388
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,434
Just say "Okay, I got it"
for once for things like this.

389
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,972
Eun-hee is home, so I'm leaving.

390
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,190
Tae-hyung, finish your coffee and come.

391
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,653
Whereâ¦

392
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,493
-Where should I go?
-You figure it out.

393
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,277
Why did Mom call Eun-hee?

394
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,867
She'll just say, "Mom, do as you wish."

395
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,871
"I'm always on your side."

396
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,457
Go after her.

397
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,893
-Got it?
-Hey.

398
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,807
-Jeez.
-Just shake it off, okay?

399
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,813
Graduation from marriage is sugarcoating.

400
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,605
It's just kissing his butt
when he made money

401
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,609
and abandoning him after retirement!

402
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,435
-You're right.
-Right.

403
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,986
Goodness, what are you saying?

404
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,779
If you say such things these days,

405
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,913
you'll become marriage graduate buddies.

406
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,620
Are you guys still talking
about my graduation from marriage?

407
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,002
Stop it already.

408
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,165
It's all because of you, Oppa.

409
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,288
Our poor Sang-sik oppa.

410
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,835
What are you going to do?

411
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,129
I never expected your wife to do that.

412
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,338
By the way, does that mean
we can't have your wife's kimchi anymore?

413
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,845
-You littleâ¦
-Goodness.

414
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,511
I can bring kimchi.

415
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,015
Oppa?

416
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,977
Straighten your shoulders.

417
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,153
What's wrong with my shoulders?

418
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,441
Hey. What's graduation from marriage?

419
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,284
It's graduating from marriage.

420
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,451
That means you can get into a new school!

421
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,909
-Right!
-You can do that.

422
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:38,079
That's right, Oppa.
You can go to a new school.

423
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,291
Why are you calling everyone oppa?

424
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,372
I don't drink alcohol

425
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,997
Help yourselves.

426
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,384
Cheers!

427
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,381
Mom, do as you wish.

428
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,838
I agree with everything you do.

429
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,220
I'm on your side.

430
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,681
The symbolic area of Havana,
the port city, is Malecon.

431
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,604
I'm leaving.

432
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,732
It's surrounded by the water.

433
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,979
It's always filled with people

434
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,532
as you can take walks, fish,
and even enjoy dates with your partner.

435
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:13,568
The entire area,
including the Habana Vieja,

436
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,445
is a UNESCO World Heritageâ¦

437
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,673
-You drove here.
-I'm calling a designated driver.

438
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,499
Mom is graduating,

439
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,043
so I must drink as her daughter.

440
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,547
I'm planning to drink a lot.

441
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,625
Hey, Ji-woo.

442
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,304
There must've been signs.

443
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,473
Did Mom and Dad have a big fight recently?

444
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,215
Not at all.

445
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,522
Whenever Dad's home, the house is silent.

446
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,690
When Dad's not home,
there's the sound of the TV,

447
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,401
Mom sings,

448
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,901
and she even chats
with her friends over the phone.

449
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,531
But whenever Dad's home,
it's total silence.

450
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,109
They're both silent.

451
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,912
What did Eun-joo say to Mom?

452
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,038
If you're so curious, call her.

453
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,921
I'm not. I'm sure she only said
harsh and realistic things.

454
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,627
"Did Dad agree?"
"Will he share the house?"

455
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,762
"How will you support yourself?"

456
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,339
"What can you do?"

457
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,886
Amazing.

458
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,260
Eun-joo also guessed
what you would say 100% right.

459
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,515
"I'm always on Mom's side."
"Mom, do as you wish."

460
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,693
You guys know each other so well.
Why don't you see her?

461
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,151
Know what?

462
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,320
Eun-joo knows nothing about me.

463
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,816
Go buy alcohol.

464
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,624
I charge double.

465
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,740
Double, okay?

466
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,948
Okay.

467
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,761
Yoon Seo-young.

468
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,887
I told you to quit if you get caught
sleeping here one more time.

469
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,024
I'm not going to sleep here.

470
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,312
I was about to go home.

471
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,107
Really? Then go home.

472
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,025
Okay.

473
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,317
I really was about to go home.

474
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,065
Why look at someone else's photos?

475
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,117
I was curious about what photos
our CEO took back in university.

476
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,252
Go home.

477
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,999
Why are you here at this time?

478
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,250
To monitor me?

479
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,871
I have to revise the editing.

480
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,088
-I have to pull an all-nighter.
-Again?

481
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,053
They pay us so little,
yet they're so tyrannical.

482
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,835
-I'll help you.
-Go. You're distracting me.

483
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,386
Get out of here.

484
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,642
I guess I should just go home.

485
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,424
EUN-JOO

486
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,625
You take care of Mom.
I'll take care of Dad.

487
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,587
Take care of what?

488
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,444
"We're their children,

489
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,980
so we should tell them
to think twice about it."

490
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,614
"Should we just be democratic
and agree with the divorce

491
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,112
just because they talked about it
and he agreed?"

492
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,622
This is tiring.

493
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,874
It's not a divorce.

494
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,542
It's graduation from marriage.

495
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,791
What kind of lunatic
made such an expression?

496
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,459
A word called "separation" already exists.

497
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,216
"It's not complicated enough
to make a new expression for it, right?"

498
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,972
Kim Eun-joo.

499
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,228
Gosh. Okay.

500
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,692
All right.

501
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,145
Call her.

502
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,872
There's no need to.

503
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,906
She doesn't call me, either.

504
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,119
Why am I so frustrated?

505
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:35,714
I'm going to bed.

506
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Gosh.

507
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,595
Are you ready?

508
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,809
MEDITATION CENTER

509
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,233
I don't want to do this.

510
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,151
Why not?

511
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,988
I don't want to reflect on myself.

512
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,068
My life has been so problematic.

513
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,818
Thenâ¦

514
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,906
-Don't meditate.
-Okay.

515
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,004
Just sit there.

516
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,539
As an employee of a publishing company,

517
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,712
you should know
everything about the author.

518
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,588
Yes.

519
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,631
One, as you breathe in,

520
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,762
and two, as you breathe out.

521
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,265
Some daysâ¦

522
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,282
were as long as life.

523
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,281
Take out the memory

524
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,294
of that day,

525
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,962
which you've been keeping.

526
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:20,605
MARCH 10, 2016

527
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,978
The longest day of my life.

528
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,530
It was that day.

529
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,757
Mom.

530
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,767
Did you get up at this hour because of me?

531
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,595
I must be getting old.

532
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,435
I can't sleep at dawn.

533
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,108
What about Dad?

534
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,565
I knew Mom was crying, but I ignored it.

535
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,160
So that's whenâ¦

536
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,736
Mom was preparing for a divorce.

537
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,875
Did Dad blow up and throw his lunch again?

538
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,717
Water's dripping. Go dry your hair.

539
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,691
When did I take off the ring?

540
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,444
It was over for us a long time ago.

541
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,031
I'm leaving!

542
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,985
-Have a slice of bread before you go.
-I'm late.

543
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,236
You didn't move a muscle
the whole weekend,

544
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,405
I'm proud you woke up.

545
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,003
Good rest made me more tired.

546
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,078
My back feels stiff.

547
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,373
You only rest on weekends

548
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,956
and you're busy at work.

549
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,631
Do you even see Jong-min?

550
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,455
That's how long-term couples are.

551
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,511
-You should set a wedding date soon, then.
-Mom.

552
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,800
Don't nag at someone
who's on her way to work.

553
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,176
Youâ¦

554
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:19,061
This is the only time I can talk to you.

555
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,270
Jeez, you're exaggerating.

556
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,771
Do you contact your sister?

557
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,903
Ask her when she's going to quit her job.

558
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,360
This isn't the Joseon Dynasty.

559
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,280
You're free to call a married daughter.

560
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,858
Why worry about the in-laws?

561
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,743
A doctor family isn't a big deal.

562
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,950
She said she'll have a baby,

563
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,281
so I don't understand
why she's still working.

564
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,986
If you're that curious, call her.

565
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,998
Don't say "Eun-joo this and that" to me.

566
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,826
Bye.

567
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,972
Give me Dad's lunch. I'll eat it.

568
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,179
Even money can't buy this lunch.

569
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,265
He's so spoiled and pampered.

570
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,019
I'm leaving.

571
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,477
-Be careful.
-Okay.

572
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,127
Did you call me?

573
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,393
Yes, I'm Kim Eun-hee.

574
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,717
Youâ¦

575
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,769
I mean, meâ¦

576
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,104
Were you expecting
that a moment like this would come?

577
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,652
Lookâ¦

578
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,112
We didnât expect you to come alone.

579
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,903
Jong-min has been calling me,

580
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,120
but I didn't answer his calls.

581
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,200
You're nothing but a cheater

582
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,496
and you dared to come here with Jong-min?

583
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,618
Cheater?

584
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,496
What do you mean?

585
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,804
Hye-soo has been
dating Jong-min for three years.

586
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,011
So those two knew about me already.

587
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,600
And they shook me
by saying I was the cheater.

588
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,309
Well, I've been dating him for nine years.

589
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,390
Both of our families know each other well.

590
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,726
That makes no sense.

591
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,857
We've been seeing each other
every weekend for three years.

592
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,859
Jong-min and I were really estranged.

593
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,200
We were just a couple
who's been dating for a long time.

594
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,831
I went to Jong-min's house
quite often as well

595
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,829
and I didn't sense any trace of you.

596
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,003
You went to Jong-min's house?

597
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,501
-Jong-min doesn't live alone.
-Chan-hyuk knows me, too.

598
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,974
Chan-hyuk knows you, too?

599
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,429
He's Jong-min's friend who lives with him,
so of course, he does.

600
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,850
We ate together a few times, too.

601
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:10,519
I also went on a trip
with Jong-min this past weekend.

602
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,645
A trip?

603
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,905
JONG-MIN

604
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,160
3 MISSED CALLS

605
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,326
It has to be rice.

606
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,457
No noodles.

607
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,458
Excuse me.

608
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,514
I'll eat separately today.

609
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,168
Why all of a sudden?

610
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,127
Eun-joo.

611
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,050
My sister is here.

612
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,890
Okay.

613
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,516
What's wrong?

614
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,189
Eun-jooâ¦

615
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,332
I don't know what happened, but don't cry.
People are watching.

616
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,006
You didnât eat at all.

617
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,169
Leave it here, please.

618
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,772
Why did you come to me?
You should go to Jong-min.

619
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,021
I don't know.

620
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,612
Jong-pal keeps calling me,

621
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,862
but I didn't answer the calls.

622
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,363
I can't answer them right now.

623
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,450
Are you going to break up?

624
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,369
I'm not sure about that either.

625
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,630
If you're not sure and won't break up,
why are you crying?

626
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,170
I told you
something's weird about you two.

627
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,417
Never mind.

628
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,717
What's the point of saying this now?

629
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,175
I'm sure you knew it already.

630
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,772
But you ignored it so you would feel okay.

631
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,478
Confrontation is always
the most difficult for you.

632
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,021
You just got a job, so you were tired.

633
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,813
You wanted to rest on weekends,

634
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,067
so you talked over the phone
and that was it.

635
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,651
If you've been dating for nine years,
either get married or break up.

636
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,988
It's not something to cry about.
Eat your food.

637
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,995
I didn't like him from the beginning.

638
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,504
Nothing's clear about him.

639
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,711
He told small, unnecessary lies.

640
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,956
He always pretended to know

641
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,054
all the books and movies
when he could've just said he didn't know.

642
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,720
I really hated that. No one said anything.

643
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,140
It's not important,
but he was so serious about it.

644
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,508
And he acts sociable,

645
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,096
but he kissed up and kicked down.

646
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,929
This situation doesn't surprise me at all.

647
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,812
You should've told me nine years ago.

648
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,975
I've been telling you all this time.
You just never listened.

649
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,855
I shouldn't have come to see you.

650
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,990
I'm such an idiot
to see you on a day like this.

651
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,823
You brat.

652
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,580
I don't even expect you to comfort me.

653
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Can't you just

654
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:18,168
be there for me
when you're my older sister?

655
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,249
You're out of line.
Don't take it out on me.

656
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,384
I'm sorry.

657
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,458
It's all my fault.

658
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,798
I dated a jerk

659
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,592
and came to see you for nothing!

660
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,926
I'm sorry for everything!

661
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,259
Youâ¦

662
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,978
You're so sick.

663
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,555
I never want to see you again.

664
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:53,116
I didnât know that you
had a miscarriage at the time.

665
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,543
You were having a hard time too.

666
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,198
I really didnât know.

667
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,498
You never say anything.

668
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,384
You make us hear about your news
from other people.

669
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,716
Hey.

670
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,262
Jong-min told me to step outside
because you're coming.

671
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,891
I'm here to see you.

672
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,055
What?

673
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,442
Me?

674
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,809
You're the worst, you jerk.
You're not even a friend!

675
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,728
What are you saying all of a sudden?

676
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,026
I heard you knew everything.
That woman said she knows you.

677
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,742
She said the three of you
ate and drank together!

678
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,454
What theâ¦

679
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,997
Come inside and talk.

680
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,495
When she said that,
I was more angry at you than him.

681
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,506
What a great friendship you guys have.

682
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,668
Am I not your friend?

683
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,258
You must've thought I was a joke,
laughing around so cluelessly.

684
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,593
Your habit is coming back.

685
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,684
You're blaming the wrong person.

686
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,433
You coward. Let's get this straight.

687
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,965
Have we seen each other lately?

688
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,938
Did I ever get the chance
to see you as a joke?

689
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,148
-You never came here!
-Hey.

690
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,809
What's wrong with you guys?

691
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,067
-I see.
-Go stay outside.

692
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,360
So you never had the chance.

693
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,822
I feel so sorry for not coming here
because I was busy, you bastard.

694
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,320
Couldnât you make time to tell me?

695
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,947
I didn't know what to tell you!

696
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,495
You shouldn't be involved.
What's wrong with you guys?

697
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,083
We'll talk it out, okay? I'm sorry.

698
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,415
Because you didn't know what to say?

699
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,172
You didn't care enough to do so.

700
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,474
You don't care about others.
You're just an irresponsible jerk!

701
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,719
He said he was going to tell you
when it was time, so what can I say?

702
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,512
And let's get this straight.

703
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,765
Do you think a long-term relationship
is a vested right protected by law?

704
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,519
Is there a privilege in it?

705
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,401
He was fed up, so he dated another girl.

706
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,898
What was I supposed to say?

707
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,480
Hey, watch your mouth!

708
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,275
Watch what? You punk!

709
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,282
Hey, you two are done.

710
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,200
Even I'm fed up.

711
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,792
Nine years? Did you think it was some
great love because it surprised people?

712
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,787
Both of you are cowards

713
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,291
and you guys just put up
with each other for more than five years.

714
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,245
Yes, okay.

715
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,377
We, the two cowards will break up today,

716
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,375
so please get out.

717
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,591
As of today,

718
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,053
I'm done with you too.

719
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,681
-You're out.
-Okay.

720
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,894
Thank you for telling me politely
even if it's been a long time.

721
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,226
I feel much better too.

722
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,115
On that day, I couldn't make out

723
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,544
what was okay to lose
and what I had to keep and protect

724
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,923
for the long term.

725
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,555
Get rid of everything that comes to mind.

726
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,654
Memories are saved as images.

727
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,947
Take out the images of the past
that you kept hidden

728
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,871
and hadn't taken out.

729
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,627
Keep taking them out

730
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,381
and keep getting rid of them.

731
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,677
Now open your eyes.

732
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,563
That's it for today.

733
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,693
Thank you for your cooperation
with filming.

734
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,593
It's six o'clock.

735
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,206
You said to tell you when it's six.

736
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,718
Right.

737
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,507
5:50 P.M.

738
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,973
Right.

739
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,692
-Let's talk for ten minutes.
-Okay.

740
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,519
Looks like you have something to say.

741
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,567
There's this regular customer I like.

742
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,698
She suddenly started to
drink coffee, which she quit,

743
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,530
and she drank wine and had a hangover.

744
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,615
And it looks like she started working.

745
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,874
What does this all mean?

746
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,036
That's my privacy.

747
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,171
I have an important call to make.

748
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,005
Okay.

749
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,394
Removing the back of the truck
seems a bit funny.

750
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,516
Isn't this an expensive car?

751
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,103
It's all debt.

752
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:19,529
I won't charge you for riding it,
so just buy me a meal. Nothing's free.

753
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,370
Yes, my older daughter.

754
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,838
Dad, isn't it dinnertime?

755
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,383
Yes.

756
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,714
When are you coming to Seoul?

757
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,094
Why?

758
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,045
So I can see you.

759
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,055
You're busy. Why do you need to see me?

760
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,603
Did your mother say something?

761
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,606
-Yes.
-Don't mind it.

762
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,358
I'm going to do
what your mother wants to do.

763
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,651
Let's meet and talk first.

764
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,656
I have to go to Ulsan

765
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,663
to load the truck and return to Incheon.

766
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,452
And load the truck again there.

767
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,906
I'm a bit busy.

768
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,616
I'll go to Incheon.

769
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,246
Call me when you come.

770
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,833
It'll be just a moment, Dad.

771
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,049
Okay.

772
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,877
Dad, make sure to eat.

773
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,505
-And drive safely.
-Okay.

774
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,222
-Eun-joo.
-Yes?

775
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,345
You knowâ¦

776
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,974
Live happily

777
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:38,937
and lovingly with Tae-hyung.

778
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,606
Don't focus too much
on having a baby and justâ¦

779
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,070
live happily

780
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,032
and joyfully together.

781
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,620
Okay.

782
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:14,218
MUNMAE SERVICE CENTER

783
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,848
Thank you for choosing us
as the publisher for the meditation book.

784
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,360
-Please read it.
-Okay.

785
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,282
We'll read it carefully and thoroughly.

786
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,530
Thank you.

787
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,950
Let's go.

788
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,084
Eun-hee.

789
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,380
I didnât expect to see you here.

790
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,762
I know, right? Why are you here?

791
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,418
Right.

792
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,087
This is the Golden Goose Media Team.
Shooting Director Kim Young-ho.

793
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,848
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Kim Eun-hee.

794
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,680
This is the producer.

795
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,096
-I'm Yoon Seo-young.
-Hi, I'm Kim Eun-hee.

796
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,517
I saw you while shooting
and you have amazing concentration.

797
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,114
By the way, I never agreed to be filmed.

798
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,914
We can remove you from the video.

799
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,452
Long time no see.

800
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,623
Young-ho, return the shooting devices,
and you two can go home.

801
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,371
What about you?

802
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,915
Do you have plans after this?

803
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:21,964
Me?

804
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,803
I don't.

805
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,957
Let's have dinner.
We have something to talk about.

806
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,639
Okay.

807
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,216
-Are we dismissed, then?
-Bye.

808
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,055
Stop being flirtatious.

809
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,270
The way you talk
gets more and more out of control.

810
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,694
-Are you still being flirtatious?
-"Still?"

811
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,943
You were popular
because you were exceptionally kind

812
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,776
to female friends.

813
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,994
Don't talk about the past.
I hate that alumni reunion vibe.

814
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,539
You guys aren't having a fling, are you?

815
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,829
Focus on work at the company.
Don't do anything stupid.

816
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,165
What?

817
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,210
Don't you remember?

818
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,962
When I told you
Jong-pal and I were dating, you said,

819
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,916
"Just study at school.
Don't do anything stupid."

820
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,546
I really hate that alumni reunion vibe.

821
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,335
You got old, too.

822
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,598
That was a long time ago.

823
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,349
I like it. I'm going to do it more.

824
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,351
I feel like I'm suddenly getting younger.

825
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,016
What should we eat?

826
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,148
Thanks.

827
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,942
For what?

828
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,698
For asking a friend who let her
anger out on you and cut ties with you

829
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,359
to eat together.

830
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,068
And acting like nothing happened.

831
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,869
Thank you.

832
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,495
Maybe it's the meditation?

833
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,497
It works so well.

834
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,035
Let's eat soup and rice.

835
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,884
I'm in.

836
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,594
Time for soup and rice.

837
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,383
Hey.

838
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,255
President.

839
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,022
Yes.

840
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,018
You're always working hard.

841
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,312
We must go to the peak.

842
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,266
Yes.

843
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,186
That guy named Hong is nothing but talk.

844
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,605
How could he have made
8,000,000 won last month?

845
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,525
That lunatic.

846
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,743
Leave him out.

847
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,284
No need to call him.
Just send him a message.

848
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,238
Yes.

849
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,161
All right.

850
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,246
Gosh.

851
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,982
We need to talk.

852
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,315
Why?

853
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,741
Is something wrong?

854
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,620
Yes.

855
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,657
There's something wrong.

856
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,789
Who?

857
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,171
Eun-joo?

858
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,128
Eun-hee?

859
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,298
Ji-woo? Who is it?

860
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:54,842
Us.

861
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,471
Us?

862
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,138
No, me.

863
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,099
What is it?

864
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,609
I want to put an end to this.

865
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,068
What?

866
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,367
Put an end to what?

867
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,337
There's a thing called
graduation from marriage nowadays.

868
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,381
It means to graduate from marriage.

869
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,472
Because divorce is complicated.

870
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,806
It's about not seeing each other
and living separately.

871
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,428
It seems like a wise thing to do.

872
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,439
We should graduate from marriage too.

873
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,173
Can you see this?

874
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,843
It's rock-hard because it's been
cramped all my life.

875
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,626
I've worked so hard
and there's less work nowadays,

876
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,005
so I'm going hiking.

877
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,353
I know.

878
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,564
And I also know how hard that job is.

879
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:35,152
I also know that you've
worked hard and diligently all your life,

880
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,480
and raised three kids well by doing so.

881
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,238
So Iâ¦

882
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,783
I've been doing great until now.

883
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,528
-You were happy when I made money.
-Moneyâ¦

884
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,407
It's not about money!

885
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,044
I get why you won't divorce me.

886
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,671
You hate living with me,
but you want me to make money.

887
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,748
If soâ¦

888
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,378
Let's get a divorce.

889
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,344
I won't ask for money.
Let's sell this apartment and split it.

890
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,763
Did you buy this house?

891
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,394
Yes.

892
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,694
I bought it.

893
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,573
You don't want to split this either?

894
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,742
How many times do I come home in a month?

895
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,412
Graduation from marriage?

896
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,950
That's ridiculous.

897
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,408
Just don't look at me when I come home.

898
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,999
I hate it.

899
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,167
I hate it so much

900
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,964
when you're home.

901
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,465
I can't breathe.

902
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,139
I hate it when you walk.

903
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,394
I hate it

904
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,142
when you take
health supplements all by yourself.

905
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,225
I hate it when you talk
on the phone and say vulgar things.

906
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,652
I hate it when you
take your clothes off and do cupping,

907
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,192
and I hate seeing
those cupping marks on you.

908
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,776
If you hate it so much, get out!

909
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,704
You said you hate it!

910
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,661
Get out!

911
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,792
You get out.

912
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,058
Graduation or divorce, do as you wish.

913
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,608
Sell the house.

914
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,820
Split it in half or you keep all of it.
Do as you wish.

915
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,461
The vibe of this place isâ¦

916
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,343
What was the name of the restaurant
in front of our school?

917
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,086
A White Houseâ¦

918
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,092
A White House, right?

919
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,724
You're doing this on purpose because
I said I hate the reunion vibe, right?

920
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,812
What can we talk about
when we met after five years?

921
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,018
Shall we talk about politics or mukbang?

922
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,766
We can talk about BTS.

923
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,897
We're taking a bottle of soju.

924
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,022
Okay.

925
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,243
-One is enough.
-You're not drinking?

926
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,374
You're the one not drinking.
You drove here.

927
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,115
How did you know?

928
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,003
Weren't you spinning
the car key in your hand earlier?

929
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,038
Such keen eyes.

930
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,084
We're just going to eat and say goodbye,

931
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,918
so it's a waste to call a driver.

932
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,086
Ji-woo has been working for me

933
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,926
since he was discharged from the army.

934
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,561
If Ji-woo wants it too,
I'm going to hire him full-time.

935
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,808
Hire him full-time? What can he even do?

936
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,100
He's a good worker.
He's nice and sociable.

937
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,646
Small companies make
advertisements for social media,

938
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,690
and they pay us very little
but are very tyrannical.

939
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,404
But Ji-woo knows how to
deal with them sensibly.

940
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,695
You're going to take the precious
youngest son of a family and make him

941
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,452
flatter people and kiss their butts?

942
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,504
Considering how much
I would be paying him,

943
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,458
you think I hired him to flatter people?

944
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,328
He's only a little boy in your family.

945
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,875
He's an adult everywhere else.

946
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,549
That face.

947
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,093
Do you still use the silence tactic
when you're on the defensive?

948
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,178
I donât.

949
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,142
Why didn't Ji-woo tell me?

950
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,644
I told him not to tell you at first

951
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,518
and he never did.

952
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,942
He said he was going to soon.

953
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,517
Why did you tell him not to tell me?

954
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,106
Because you misunderstand easily.

955
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,028
Misunderstand what?

956
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,030
"What's his scheme in hiring my brother?"

957
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,575
"Is it because he won't complain

958
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,539
because they know each other already?"

959
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,411
I meditated but I still get angry.

960
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,208
So you remember me
as a total loser, right?

961
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,052
People say I'm generous.
I have a good personality!

962
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,168
Yes, you do have a good personality.

963
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,876
Meditation shows your personality.

964
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,796
You really are gullible.

965
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,894
You follow instructions so well.

966
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,102
You were crying so sadly.

967
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,562
I saw myself from the past.

968
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,728
You were there too.

969
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,275
I took that memory out

970
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,908
and I was so immature.

971
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,374
I thought the age of 30
was quite mature at the time,

972
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,081
but I was immature.

973
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,290
I knew nothing.

974
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,416
I'm still immature.

975
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,345
About that dayâ¦

976
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,386
I'm sorry.

977
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,349
I guess you were the only one
I could get angry at comfortably.

978
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,480
I couldn't remember

979
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,193
what I was going to say to Jong-pal.

980
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,448
But I gotâ¦

981
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,617
so angry at you.

982
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,703
I guess I trusted you more.

983
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,576
I'm sorry.

984
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,632
It took me too long to apologize.

985
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,142
Drink up.

986
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,351
Eat up.

987
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,230
-Bye.
-Thanks.

988
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,651
Let's keep in touch.

989
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,898
Well, sure.

990
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,112
What's with that reaction?

991
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,243
So you actually meant it?
Would we even need to keep in touch?

992
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,867
You've been so harsh since you were young.

993
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,245
Fine, you jerk. Take care.

994
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,870
Go on.

995
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,264
Why are you standing there all sappy?

996
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,645
Let's take a trip down memory lane
to the early 2000s.

997
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,693
"Coincidence" by Baby V.O.X.

998
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,277
It was too serious
To call it a coincidence

999
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,204
We had to ignore each other
Like we didn't know each other

1000
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,994
The changed looks

1001
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,118
Different loversâ¦

1002
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,139
At the moment my eyes met yours

1003
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:15,057
I tried so hard
Acting like I'm totally fine

1004
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:19,988
But when I saw that flustered look
On your faceâ¦

1005
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,928
Seriously.

1006
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,865
What do you want to drink?

1007
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,368
Do you have beer?

1008
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,245
I don't like spending money on coffee.

1009
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,209
You don't have to.

1010
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,248
Give me a cup of herbal tea
with no caffeine.

1011
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,627
Okay.

1012
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,260
Did you just talk casually to him?

1013
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,225
You said you'll never see me again

1014
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,771
and you randomly come
after years without even a call?

1015
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,398
I called Tae-hyung.

1016
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,897
He told me that you're here.

1017
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,449
He was happy to hear we were meeting.

1018
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,659
He told me to just go as a surprise.

1019
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,048
Did you talk to Mom?

1020
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,915
No.

1021
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,603
I'm just here to see you today.

1022
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,314
Then say something.

1023
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,744
I'm sorry, Eun-joo.

1024
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:31,534
I was wrong.

1025
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,951
I apologize.

1026
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,636
If you know, then it's okay.

1027
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,693
I had no idea what you were going through.

1028
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:05,742
Because you don't talk about those things
and endure them on your own.

1029
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,357
If I knew, I wouldn't have done that.

1030
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,447
I'm thankful that you apologized first,

1031
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,905
but what happened on that day

1032
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,043
has nothing to do with you
knowing about my situation or not.

1033
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:21,211
When things happen, you say,
"How could Jong-min do this to me?"

1034
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,379
"How could you do this to me?"

1035
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,472
And then you get exhausted
and say, "Let's stop it."

1036
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,425
That's such an immature thing to do.

1037
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,351
Anyone can do that to you.

1038
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,680
You're not special.

1039
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:38,725
Yes.

1040
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,734
I'm not special.

1041
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,228
Your facial expression says,

1042
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,275
"She's lecturing again even after years."

1043
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,689
I'm not.

1044
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,532
I feel like I'm home.

1045
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,874
I'm not your home.

1046
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:53,949
Right.

1047
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,083
You hate vague expressions, right?

1048
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,872
You're not home. You're just my sister.

1049
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,790
All right.

1050
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:52,973
Why did I take so many photos
that I wouldn't even look at later?

1051
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,462
TEAM MANAGER KIM EUN-HEE
BEGIN WORK

1052
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,131
I got here first!

1053
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,966
-Hi.
-Hi.

1054
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:44,691
What's going on?

1055
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,609
What's going on?
What's with your fashion today?

1056
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:52,859
Why do you look even tackier
when you dress up?

1057
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,073
Why are all of you here so early?

1058
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,414
It's the same reason why you dressed up.

1059
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,491
Me?

1060
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,615
I just got up earlier today than usual.

1061
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,122
Then I guess everyone got up early.

1062
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,825
They were either nervous or excited

1063
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,495
because the Vice CEO
is coming from the headquarters.

1064
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,302
So it's today.

1065
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,588
Don't act like you don't know.

1066
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,722
Didn't you get dressed
like this for a get-together

1067
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,261
posing as a welcoming ceremony
at a fancy place?

1068
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:20,755
He's here.

1069
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,063
Everyone.

1070
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,564
The Vice CEO is here from the US.

1071
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,324
Stay seated. You got seats in the evening.

1072
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,329
Why get together in a place like this?

1073
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,754
I crave beer and soju today.

1074
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,753
Have you ever mixed spirits and wine?
That thing is incredible.

1075
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,126
Sounds awful.
I guess rich people are different.

1076
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,973
-Yes.
-Why do you mix those expensive things?

1077
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,338
Because I'm rich. Why?

1078
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,466
-Look at all the alcohol.
-It's all alcohol.

1079
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,767
This place is insane.

1080
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,569
Kim Eun-hee.

1081
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,195
Eun-hee.

1082
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,990
Hey.

1083
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,044
Go on in first.

1084
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,380
-Does she know him?
-Yes.

1085
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:39,052
That jerk wasted Eun-hee's 20s.

1086
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,803
Look at him ignoring me.

1087
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:45,385
By the way, why did he
ignore me but call Eun-hee?

1088
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,826
How are you doing?

1089
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,497
Fine.

1090
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,384
Itâs my wedding anniversary today.

1091
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,456
My wife wanted to skip dinner

1092
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,007
and have some wine.

1093
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,931
But I got here too early.

1094
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,136
You must be enjoying your life.

1095
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,690
Do you still keep in touch with Chan-hyuk?

1096
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,741
Yes.

1097
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,782
I had a drink with him yesterday as well.

1098
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,945
I see.

1099
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,164
So you two still see each other.

1100
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,089
Give me Chan-hyuk's number.

1101
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,013
Ms. Kim.

1102
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,652
FATHER

1103
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,997
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

1104
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,640
Hi.

1105
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,220
Mom, what are you doing?

1106
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,385
Cleaning.

1107
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,099
I can understand
why you live without things.

1108
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,443
Throwing things away
does make me feel better.

1109
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:56,809
Mom.

1110
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,901
Dad's not answering.

1111
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,283
That's how he is all the time.

1112
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,900
But he keeps his dinnertime
like clockwork.

1113
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,198
I'm sure he has a reason
why he can't answer it.

1114
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,582
I have to take out the recyclable wastes.

1115
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:12,828
Okay.

1116
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,170
KIM SANG-SIK

1117
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,853
CHILBO DRIVER REST STOP

1118
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,561
Goodness.

1119
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,524
What?

1120
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,725
Why is Sang-sik's truck here at this hour?

1121
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,649
That's weird. He's the most diligent man.

1122
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,968
Eun-hee?

1123
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,339
-Are you awake?
-Is something wrong?

1124
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,506
I heard Chan-hyuk stays at his office.

1125
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,057
He does.

1126
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,060
Where's his office?

1127
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,314
Why?

1128
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,903
I have something to say to him.

1129
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,109
It's nothing.

1130
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,029
But send me his address right now.

1131
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,492
At this hour?

1132
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,221
What are you doing?

1133
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,223
How did you find this place?

1134
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,647
What's wrong?

1135
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,695
Are you not packing a lunch box today?

1136
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:16,414
Today is the weekend,
loved by office workers.

1137
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:18,998
You got a call.

1138
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,423
Hello?

1139
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,172
Yes.

1140
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,419
Hi.

1141
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,797
What?

1142
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,473
No, he doesn't call
that much when he's working.

1143
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,308
Yes.

1144
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,030
Yes.

1145
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,027
Who is it?

1146
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,584
The caller cannot be reached.
Please leave a messageâ¦

1147
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,250
Mom.

1148
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,801
It's the Ulsan factory.

1149
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,381
Your father is neither calling
nor answering

1150
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,927
and hasn't come to get the load.

1151
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,683
Your father is not one to do that.

1152
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,901
What if he had an accident?

1153
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,316
What is it?

1154
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,493
I donât know why I came to see you.

1155
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,115
Youâre the only one I can tell this to.

1156
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,584
I metâ¦

1157
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,089
Jong-min yesterday.

1158
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:53,509
Iâ¦

1159
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,682
made a mistake.

1160
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,692
Mom.

1161
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,767
Where is it at?

1162
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,856
There really was
a medicine bottle in his truck.

1163
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,527
He's been identified.

1164
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,663
My body and face are so weird right now.

1165
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,621
Ms. Jin-sook?

1166
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,290
-Did you say 1982?
-Did you say 1982?

1167
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,698
So Dad is living in a time
when he and Mom were super romantic?

1168
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,327
Ms. Sook, did you kiss me?

1169
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,464
And didn't Eun-joo's style change a lot?

1170
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,838
We communicated so well.

1171
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,010
You don't want to forget it, do you?

1172
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:21,930
