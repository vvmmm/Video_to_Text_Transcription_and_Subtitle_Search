00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,660
<i>Episode 36
Extremely Polite Yumi</i>

3
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,860
<i>Yumi.</i>

4
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,580
<i>Should we...</i>

5
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,720
<i>get married?</i>

6
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,590
<i>Let's get married.</i>

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,020
The sky is pretty.

8
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,910
- Eonni Yi Da, good morning!
- Hey, good morning.

9
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,210
Wow. It's been so long since she made a comeback on here.

10
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,370
I'm talking about Yumi. She uploaded a post. What's going on?

11
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,230
Really? I'll have to leave a comment.

12
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,600
<i>A nice day for a change. Spring. A new feeling. A good hunch.</i>

13
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,990
So she just uploaded it.

14
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,350
Wait. This isn't just a normal picture of a ring.

15
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,050
Why?

16
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,740
- Hello?
- Hey, is there something going on?

17
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,250
<i>Huh?</i>
- Hurry up and come clean, something good happened, right?

18
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,740
Listen. Ruby and Writer Yumi are having dinner together today.

19
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm going to act like I came to look for Ruby and join in.

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,280
Then if Hyeong and Hyeong Wung act like you
just happened to come to that restaurant for dinner

21
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll naturally invite you to join us.

22
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,890
So I'll get there first and you guys
come in ten minutes later. Then we'll meet.

23
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,090
But you said that Yumi is dating her
ex-boyfriend again. So isn't it already game over?

24
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,140
No, no, no. Don't dare call yourself a
person if you haven't tried your best.

25
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,420
Isn't that something that stalkers say?

26
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,360
So you don't trust me, Hyeongnim.

27
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,990
You can trust me when it comes to dating.

28
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,770
Why?

29
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,670
Do you know why people call me Control Z?

30
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,120
No, but I'm not really that curious.

31
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,690
It's a bit embarrasing to say it myself,

32
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,420
but I'm a dating expert.

33
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,370
You must have a lot of dating experience then.

34
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,920
Rather than a lot, it's deep.

35
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,140
Then, how many times...?

36
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,560
You know that how deep your relationships are is
more important than how many you've had, right?

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,140
I'm the type who stays in a relationship
for a long time when I date. That's all I'll say.

38
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,250
I got it, so how many times?

39
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,870
Three times, officially.

40
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,500
Three times?

41
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,090
Three times. Hey, I've been in over seven relationships!

42
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,510
How dare you act like a know-it-all when you've only dated three times?

43
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,370
- Hey.
- Huh?

44
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,320
You said seven times? You?

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,910
Yeah.

46
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,030
Really?

47
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,550
Well...

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,570
I'm saying it's seven times if you include flirting.

49
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,270
You said it's seven times if you include flirting?

50
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,470
Hyeongnim, I would have been in a
relationship over 30 times if I included flirting.

51
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,950
Wait, if you've only dated seven times
including flirting, then this is serious.

52
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,140
Hyung Wung, I'm telling you that Yumi is lonely right now.

53
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,210
Although they're back together, it's awkward.

54
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,960
A relationship like this can't last long.

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,240
Now's your chance.

56

58
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,320
Hello?

59
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,280
- Oppa Z!
<i>Hey, Ruby. I was planning to call you...</i>

60
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,970
Oppa Z! Big news! Big news!

61
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,620
Eonni Yumi said she's getting married!

62
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,270
<i>With Team Leader Ba Bi. She said he proposed to her.</i>

63
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,050
<i>I thought things weren't going well for them, but this is a big twist!</i>

64
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,520
<i>Oh, I have to go to a meeting. I'll call you back.</i>

65
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,460
- Wait...
- Are you telling me that Yumi's getting married to her ex-boyfriend right now?

66
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,070
Hello?

67
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,050
<i>What are you up to?</i>

68
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,230
I'm drinking coffee, cleaning, and cooking.

69
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,010
I didn't tell you yesterday, did I?

70
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,110
<i>Tell me what?</i>

71
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:10,410
I've always had a feeling that I'd live happily when I got married.

72
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,040
Based on what?

73
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,570
A strong signal came to me from the future.

74
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,160
What are you saying?

75
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,440
But I became certain that it's not just a hunch yesterday.

76
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,800
I think we'll be happy.

77
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,430
You don't have much going on today,
right? Do you want to go out for lunch?

78
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,120
Lunch? I'm making a lunchbox right now.

79
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,550
There was somewhere I wanted to go with you.

80
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,560
Where?

81
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,270
Your father?

82
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,110
<i>Huh? Aunt, Su Cheol didn't get divorced.
It was the younger sibling that got divorced.</i>

83
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,840
<i>Su Cheol doesn't have a younger sibling.</i>

84
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
<i>What? Why doesn't he have a younger sibling? There's two of them.</i>

85
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,210
<i>What's the youngest one's name?</i>

86
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,820
<i>What is it?</i>

87
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:17,270
<i>Yumi grew up around a lot of adult relatives from a
young age, so she never found it difficult to interact with adults.</i>

88
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,210
<i>Do you have a boyfriend? Did you get a job?</i>

89
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,110
<i>No, I don't have a boyfriend, and I'm getting ready to get a job.</i>

90
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,640
<i>Is that so?</i>

91
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,900
<i>However...</i>

92
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,260
<i>It's different with her boyfriend's father.
Babi's Street Food</i>

93
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,550
But is it okay for me to suddenly come see him?

94
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,850
I thought that you'd feel more burdened if we made plans to see him.

95
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,530
So we can say that we decided to stop in since we were passing by,

96
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,860
greet him, and then leave.

97
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,330
Let's take the official meeting slow.

98
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,020
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

99
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,560
Welcome.

100
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,280
Father!

101
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,710
I stopped by.

102
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,270
Why did you come here with your foot like that? You should be at home.

103
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,870
I came with my girlfriend.

104
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,360
That's Ba Bi's father?

105
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,260
He doesn't look like his son at all.

106
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
He looks scarier than his picture.

107
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,970
He looks like an actor.

108
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,760
Who does he look like?

109
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,720
Move!

110
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,490
You all need to get yourselves together!

111
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,470
Is it important which actor he looks like right now?

112
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,570
He's going to be our father-in-law!

113
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,830
Marriage? Don't you know if we make
a mistake, we'll get intercepted here!

114
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,980
Say hi. He's my father.

115
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,070
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yumi.

116
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,390
Nice to meet you.

117
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,450
You should have let me know you were coming.

118
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,220
Sorry. We happened to have an
appointment in the area, so we just stopped by.

119
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,890
We thought it would be good to say hello.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, I got this...

121
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,190
Yu Mi bought it to give it to you.

122
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
You didn't have to.

123
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh it's nothing, it's just snacks.

124
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,770
We don't have any food because lunchtime
is over. We've only got tteokbokki left now.

125
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,930
Oh, no, it's okay. I really like tteokbokki.

126
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,380
<i>Tteokbokki, Soondae, Ramen, Kimbap</i>

127
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,770
The atmosphere is so nice.

128
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,910
It's been around for a while, so it's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

129
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,770
No, that makes it better! It really seems like it will be delicious.

130
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,500
My father is usually quite blunt. Especially since my mother died.

131
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,130
Yeah, you told me.

132
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,470
He's not doing it to you specifically, so don't worry about it.

133
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
What is it, Bon Hui?

134
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm outside at the moment.

135
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,860
What?

136
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,110
I'll send it to you as a photo.

137
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,620
Fax? But why...

138
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes, I understand. I'll call you once I've sent it.

139
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,550
Yu Mi, just a second.

140
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,180
Do you need to go somewhere?

141
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,180
I'll just send a fax and then I'll be back.

142
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,800
I'll go.

143
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,150
No, I need to go myself.

144
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,150
Father, the stationary store is open, right?

145
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,400
Of course, it's open.

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,360
What is the highest form of respect you
can show to someone who made you food?

147
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,250
Of course it's to eat everything
deliciously so there's nothing left over!

148
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,090
Exactly! That is the highest form of respect.

149
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,690
Hold on, this...

150
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,140
Father, that's too much.

151
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,840
Leave some.

152
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,940
So much...

153
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,440
I'll be right back. Eat.

154
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,380

<i>[Which of the following is the coolest way to greet Yumi?]
A. Yumi, congratulations. I heard that you're getting married soon.</i>

310
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,560
<i>B. I heard you got a proposal? Good for you.</i>

311
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,100
<i>C. Mr. Yu Ba Bi is a good man. You made a good decision.</i>

312
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,580
A good man? Yeah, right.

313
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,550
Does he really have to say that?

314
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,860
Hey. Hey, Love. Calm down.

315
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,500
We can just brush past it.

316
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,060
Do we really have to call her out and say this?

317
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,620
Love! This is something that makes Yumi happy.

318
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,500
It's the same as leaving comments on her web novel.

319
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,780
What's so hard about wishing her well?

320
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,300
I don't want to do it! Why do I have to go this far?

321
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,390
Wung.

322
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,650
Hey. You made it?

323
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,950
What do you want to drink?

324
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,020
Nothing.

325
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,530
I had some tea right before I came, so I'm okay.

326
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,340
Are you sick?

327
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,850
I must have a cold. I'm okay.

328
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,890
How have you been?

329
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,920
What about your finger?

330
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,280
It's fine.

331
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,140
That's a relief.

332
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,420
Congratulations.

333
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,460
Huh?

334
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,860
About that.

335
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,460
That?

336
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,120
You getting that thing.

337
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,590
Being proposed to.

338
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,160
Thank you.

339
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,610
I didn't think that you'd say that to me.

340
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,950
Thank you.

341
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,040
No need to be thankful.

342
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,050
Look at that. Yumi's happy.

343
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,490
<i>Don't get married, Yumi!</i>

344
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,620
I contacted you because I wanted to tell you that.

345
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,120
I could say it over the phone, but still...

346
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,790
Yeah.

347
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,330
When are you getting married?

348
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,900
Not right away. I think it will be
better after I finish writing the sequel.

349
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,160
So it will probably be late fall or winter.
We're thinking around November or December.

350
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,630
Oh, I see.

351
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,730
It's still far away, so it doesn't feel real.

352
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,200
Are you happy?

353
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,320
Yeah.

354
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,530
I think I am happy.

355
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,990
That's good.

356
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Good.

357
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,020
When you get married, send me a wedding invitation, too.

358
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,700
I'm not sure.

359
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,340
Why?

360
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,940
You can't do that either because I'm your ex-boyfriend?

361
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,060
I'll discuss it with him.

362
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,450
With your boyfriend?

363
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,020
Yeah. I think I should ask him.

364
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,050
Then I won't be able to go. Would Yu Ba Bi allow it?

365
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:44,050
Why are you acting like that? Are you still upset with Ba Bi?

366
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,770
Do you have to get married to that guy?

367
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,820
If you're going to do it, can't you do it with some other guy instead?

368
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,060
Why does it have to be that guy?

369
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
Wung.

370
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm saying these words for the first time in a long time.

371
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,720
What?

372
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,670
Goodness.

373
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,090
Goodness, Wung.

374
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,960
I'll take you home.

375
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,430
- That's okay.
- It's because you look sick.

376
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm okay. My house is right around the corner.

377
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,310
Can I say one more thing?

378
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,810
Stop it.

379
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,550
Do you know what I regret the most in my life?

380
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:42,530
It's when I couldn't answer when you said let's get married.

381
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,200
I thought I would have another chance after I earned some money.

382
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,460
Do you love that guy?

383
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,710
Do you love him?

384
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,330
Of course! Yeah!

385
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,160
Huh? Why isn't she saying anything? Yeah!

386
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,760
<i>What are you doing? Yumi, you have to answer him!</i>

387
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,940
<i>Say that you love him! It's Wung!</i>

388
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,180
<i>She can't answer.</i>

389
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,620
- Why?
- Love isn't here!

390
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,110
Huh?

391
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,030
- Love!

392
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,930
- I haven't seen Love either.
- Love, where are you?

393
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,850
You're saying Love isn't here?

394
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,130
Love still hasn't come back.

395
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,140
Is that possible? Has no one seen Love?

396
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,690
- I haven't.
- No.

397
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,690
- Have you seen her?
- No.

398
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,080
Love is the only one who can answer if she loves him.

399
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,190
But you said that Love isn't here!

400
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,250
That's why she can't say yes.

401
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,220
Darn it! Then I'll just answer it!

402
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,060
Why are you asking something so obvious?!

403
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,050
Why are you asking something so obvious? How childish.

404
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,020
I've always been childish. You know that.

405
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,210
Hurry up and go.

406
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,780
Bye.

407
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,900
Go home.

408
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:06,640
<i>When I wondered what love was, I realized
it was when I couldn't control how I felt.</i>

409
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,360
<i>Congratulations. Be happy.</i>

410
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,920
Hey! Why won't you die? It's 39Â°C (102.2Â°F) out here!

411
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,920
It's still bearable. Why?!

412
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,350
Hey! We'll all die first at this rate.

413
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,130
I don't care. Let's see who'll win!

414
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,950
<i>Let's go over 39 degrees!</i>

415
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,900
Do you have to go this far just to get rid of one cold?

416
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,690
You stupid fool...

417
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,400
You're crazy!

418
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,600
We'll all die. Lower the fever.

419
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,990
We don't have a temperature-lowering function, though.

420
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,090
Wait, are you determined to kill Yumi?!

421
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,390
Huh? She suddenly got cool.

422
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,410
<i>It's Ba Bi.</i>

423
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,380
Are you okay?

424
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,760
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.

425
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,600
You've got a really high fever. Should we go to the hospital?

426
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,910
It's not that bad. What about work?

427
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,130
I worked outside the office and got off work from there.

428
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,450
Let's monitor it a little longer and go
to the hospital if it doesn't get any lower.

429
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,720
You didn't eat dinner either, did you? I'll make you something.

430
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,350
I'm not hungry.

431
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,250
Get some more sleep.

432
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,920
â« <i>It's not about something I can understand</i> â«

440
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,150
<i>Who is it?</i>

441
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,890
Who was it?

442
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,580
Father sent you some tteokbboki.

443
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,220
What?

444
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,960
I spoke with him on the phone earlier, and he asked me for your address when I
said that you're sick. <i>30 years of traditional tteokbboki - Babi's Street Food</i>

445
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,570
He said that since you eat tteokbboki so well,
you should eat some if you don't have an appetite.

446
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,980
Do you want some? The soup is almost ready, too.

447
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,930
I'm so thankful.

448
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,790
Have the soup first. Let's eat the
tteokbboki when you get a little better.

449
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,040
Okay.

450
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,920
Go back to sleep.

451
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,700
<i>I'm so touched.</i>

452
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm so touched! I'm touched by Ba Bi and his father!

453
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,380
Why are they so sweet?

454
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,190
<i>When Yumi's sick, Sensitivity gets more excited than usual.</i>

455
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,120
Is sweetness hereditary for the men in this family?

456
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,950
That's crazy! I'm going crazy!

457
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,730
Ah, Yumi. Aren't you doing too well with your marriage?

458
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,320
Eat some more.

459
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,090
I ate a lot. It's so delicious.

460
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,310
Shall we take a look?

461
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,990
I think it went down a bit.

462
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,790
Aren't you going to eat dinner?

463
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,890
I'll take care of it. Go back to sleep.

464
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,800
I'll take this away.

465
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:17,150
Oh, that's right. Yumi, what do you think about Hawaii?

466
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,200
- Hawaii?
- I told you that my older sister lives in Hawaii, right?

467
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,820
What do you think about getting married
in Hawaii? I suddenly thought about it.

468
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,270
It was really nice every time I went to Nuna's house.

469
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,880
A small wedding in Hawaii?

470
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,730
A small wedding in Hawaii.

471
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,770
What? Are you saying that because you know?

472
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,960
My dream is to have a small wedding in Hawaii.

473
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Really? I didn't know. How would I know that?

474
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,940
Then, you're saying it's really a coincidence?

475
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,560
Wow.

476
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,890
I like it! I love it.

477
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,170
I knew you would like it.

478
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,940
Get some more sleep. You're sick.

479
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,860
I think it would be nice to have a small wedding in Hawaii.

480
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,500
Yeah. Let's talk about it again later.

481
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,570
Go to sleep.

482
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,410
Ha-Hawaii?

483
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,150
Don't talk anymore. Go back to sleep.

484
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,240
You're sick.

485
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,310
I think I'd love to have a small wedding in Hawaii.

486
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,670
How can he be like this?

487
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,920
How could his Nuna live in Hawaii?

488
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,930
I thought that we'd end up having a small wedding in Hawaii with Wung.

489
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,570
You really never know how things will turn out.

490
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,190
Life is mysterious.

491
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,460
<i>When she's sick, she gets twice as touched and twice as annoyed.</i>

492
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,690
<i>She also fantasizes twice as much.</i>

493
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,320
Yumi, you're awake?

494
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,300
Your fever went down.

495
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,550
How do you feel?

496
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,380
I think I'm okay now.

497
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,910
Ba Bi, hurry up and go.

498
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,070
I'm not going to go.

499
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,130
You have to go to work tomorrow.

500
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,320
I'll just sleep here.

501
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,810
You seem like you've gotten a little better, so I'll go buy some beer.

502
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,830
A soccer game is on soon.

503
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,700
I'll have some beer before I go to bed.

504
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,940
I'll be back.

505
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,510
No, don't go.

506
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,100
I can't?

507
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,160
Go, go.

<i>Totally!</i>

511
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,880
I should wash my face.

512

What's with this look?

513
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,280

<i>Thank you.</i>

524
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,050
CEO, you're tired, aren't you? You couldn't
get any rest as soon as you came here.

525
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,780
I slept during the plane ride, so not really.

526
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,120
Miss Seo Yeon said she was bringing
clothes for you to change into earlier.

527
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,280
And this is your mail that came while you were on the business trip.

528
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,820
Why is there so much?

529
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,020
<i>Park Yong Seon, Lee Som Yi</i>

530
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,120
Yong Seon, that punk, is getting married.

531
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,850
Seok Ju is, too.

532
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,360
Are these guys all getting married in a row?

533
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,160
Why are they all wedding invitations?

<i>I'm not sure. I'll discuss it with him.</i>

538
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,100
Alright, guys. Let's hold hands.

539
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,080
That day has finally come.

540
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,620
You've prepared your heart, right?

541
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,210
We got rid of all the lingering feelings.

542
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,590
We decided to calmly let Yumi go.

543
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,990
<i>It is a wedding invitation.

<i>Why is the wedding invitation so pretty?</i>

546
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,330
<i>Yumi probably picked it out, right?</i>

547
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,330
<i>- I don't want to look at it.
- I don't want to see it.</i>

Mr. CEO, you're not going to the company. You're going home, right?

556
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,600
I'll go home and get some rest.

Please schedule the meeting after four o'clock.

Yes, sir.

- Please go to Hannam-do.
- Yes, sir.

<i>This is Yumi's neighborhood.</i>

<i>That was when we had the least money, but were the happiest.</i>

563
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,350
One moment. Please stop the car.

564
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,940
Please take my luggage to my house and
leave it there. I'll head straight to the company.

00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,870
Where are you going, CEO?

566
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,180
There's somewhere I want to visit for a bit.

567
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,650
Then it would be best to go by car.

<i>When he would get off work, Yumi would wait for him there.</i>

- Put it down there.
<i>Huh?</i>

573
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,360
<i>Isn't that sofa from Yumi's place?</i>

00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:01,110
<i>You're right. That's Yumi's bookcase.</i>

575
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,370
Are they moving to Ba Bi's place?

Or to a new newlywed home?

Don't cry, Love.

579
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,990
We said we would smile when she gets married.

580
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,860
Stop!

581

Sure, but where is the tenant?

Are you her husband?

No, I'm not.

591
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:44,290
I thought you were her husband.

592
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,560
She said she had to stop by somewhere for a bit and left.

593
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,180
Please be careful.

594
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,150
She's even taking that dining table to the newlywed home?

595
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,720
They're going to even eat at that dining table...

596
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,530
He didn't buy it for that to happen...

597

There you again! If you're going to be like this then let's just go.

We're not going to see Yumi.

Come on, let's just go. Come on.

600

- Let's just go.

601

Yes, the deposit went through. I verified it.

Thank you.

603
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,860
- Thank you.
- No problem.

604
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,280
- Get home safely.
- I will.

605
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,140
Wung!

606
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,670
It was you.

607

What are you doing here?

608
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,880
I had a lecture nearby, so I stopped by.

609
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,590
I see.

610
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,580
I'm here because of my house.

611
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,620
Congratulations.

612
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,130
You know?

613
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,740
Of course, I know.

614
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,480
So you heard. Thanks.

615
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,150
But I don't know if it was a good idea. The loan was a lot.

616
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,620
You took out the loan?

617
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,500
Of course, I would.

618
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,820
Is that necessary?

619
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,920
I don't have enough money, so what else would I do?

620
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,530
What the heck, Yu Ba Bi? You're making
Yumi take out a loan and getting married?

621
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,930
He has no conscience. If they're going to get married
like that then Wung would have married her by now!

622
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,800
That's right.

623
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,650
Guys, please stop!

624
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,350
I mean... well...

625
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,730
It's not my business.

626
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,940
I will pay back the debt slowly.

627
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,580
Exactly, why are you paying that debtâ

628
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,970
Yes, anyway, congratulations.

629
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,650
That's not important anyway.

630
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,370
Still, I'm excited.

631
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,700
As long as you are happy.

632
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,240
You got the wedding invitation, right? I sent it.

633
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,390
Yeah.

634
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,200
Are you going to come to the wedding?

635
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,550
Of course.

636
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,040
I'm glad.

637
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,690
Why? Did you think I wouldn't go?

638
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,170
Possibly. I thought it was a 50/50 chance.

639
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,620
It's too bad. It would have been nice to grab a coffee,

640
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,650
but I have to get back. They're moving out my things right now.

641
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,850
Head back. I'm also leaving now.

642
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,450
A taxi is coming.

643
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,690
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

644
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,370
I'll see you at the wedding.

645
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,050
Okay.

646
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,570
I will look forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.

647
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,490
What?

648
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:23,520
I think you will look really beautiful.

649
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,630
Bye.

650
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,820
What? Me?

651
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,480
<i>Hold on. Wasn't there something weird
about the end of that conversation just now?</i>

652
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,660
<i>It was weird. Something was off.</i>

653
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,180
<i>The wedding invitation! Check the wedding invitation!</i>

654
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,830
<i>What the! What's this?</i>

655
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,510
<i>The bride isn't Kim Yumi!
[Bride - Kang Yi Da]</i>

656
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,690
<i>Kang Yi Da?!
[Groom - Ahn Dae Yong]</i>

657
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,010
<i>Yumi's friend, Kang Yi Da?</i>

658
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,250
<i>Yi Da was debating on whether she should give you a wedding invitation.</i>

659
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,560
<i>You told her to send her an invitation whenever she gets married.</i>

660
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,890
Sir, please go backwards!

661
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,260
Sure.

662
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,630
- Excuse me?!
- Please drive backwards. Backwards!

663
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,270
Right now?

664
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,640
I said go back! Go back!

665
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,210
<i>So I am sending one on her behalf.
She won't be hurt if you don't come. Yumi.</i>

666
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,270
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

667
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,540
Wung!

668
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,490
It's Yi Da's wedding.

669
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:43,930
What?

670
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:48,370
- The wedding invitation. It's Yi Da's wedding invitation.
- Yeah.

671
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,190
Then what we're you just talking about?

672
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,910
You weren't talking about coming to Yi Da's wedding?

673
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,540
Why are you moving?

674
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,670
- Moving?
- You moved out all of your things.

675
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,150
I saw them putting things into the moving van.

676
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,890
I bought my apartment.

677
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,110
I thought it was a waste to keep paying rent,

678
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:09,100
so I took my deposit and took out a loan to buy
the place even though it was a little impractical.

679
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,850
Since I bought it, I'm going to put in new wallpaper and flooring.

680
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,280
That's why I'm moving everything to storage.

681
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,460
You weren't congratulating me on buying a place?

682
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,370
No.

683
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,670
Then what were you talking about earlier?

684
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,560
- I thought you knew.
- What about you?

685
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,170
Me?

686
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,250
Your wedding?

687
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,940
Are you not getting married? It's been a while.

688
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,320
Oh...

689
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,570
I'm not.

690
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,270
Then when are you going to?

691
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,440
We broke up.

692
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,970
I guess you didn't know. I thought you heard.

693
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,120
Iâ I didn't know.

694
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,940
That's what happened.

695
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,390
I see.

696
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,790
I didn't know, sorry.

697
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,160
It's fine.

698
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,550
Then I'll see you at Yi Da's wedding.

699
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,520
All right.

700
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,140
I'll get going.

701
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,860
Okay.

702
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,810
Sir, let's go, please.

703
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,460
But why...

704
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:51,230
<i>Wung probably wanted to ask why we broke up.</i>

705
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,250
<i>Goodbye, ajeossi.
Eight months ago.</i>

706
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,450
<i>Goodbye!</i>

707
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:09,370
âª <i>Happy Birthday to you</i> âª

708
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,320
âª <i>Happy Birthday to you</i> âª

709
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,650
<i>That night
That's enough...</i>

710
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,970
<i>when I was drunk on my birthday.</i>

711
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,030
âª <i>Dear Da Eun</i> âª

712
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:33,560
<i>The moment I wasn't thinking right, I called him just once.</i>

713
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:38,020
<i>Calling Team Leader Yu Ba Bi</i>

714
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,640
<i>Yu Da Eun (Intern)</i>

715
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,870
<i>That's a relief he didn't answer.</i>

716
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,470
<i>Team Leader Yu Ba Bi</i>

717
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,770
<i>That's a relief.</i>

718
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,050
<i>I didn't know this was love.</i>

719
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,990
<i>My feelings not being what I want them to be.</i>

720
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,700
<i>Does she want to eat tteokbokki?</i>

721
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,770
<i>Yumi, are you sleeping?</i>

722
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,850
<i>Missed call from Yu Da Eun (Intern)</i>

723
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,650
<i>Yu Da Eun (Intern)</i>

724
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,780
<i>Delete contact</i>

725
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,330
<i>The contact has been deleted.</i>

726
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,420
How are you feeling?

727
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,450
I'm fine. I think I'm all better.

728
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,220
Then let's eat breakfast.

729
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,840
Okay.

730
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,250
Did you reply?

731
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,560
Huh?

732
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:03,830
To your father. Did you reply back?

733
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,680
That the tteokbokki arrived well.

734
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,000
Oh... No.

735
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,980
I will have to do it. I will call him later.

736
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,880
You don't have to. I will tell him later.

737
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,690
Still, won't he like it more if I do it?

738
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:21,780
Of course, he would.

739
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,410
<i>The reason we broke up</i>

<i>Yu Da Eun (Intern)</i>

742
