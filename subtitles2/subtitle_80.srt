You don't really stop and think about why

5
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:30,996
half of the population
of the planet is wearing them

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,860
on any given day.

7
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:34,448
We just are.

8
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,141
Have you ever asked yourself

9
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:41,144
why everyone you know

10
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,216
owns multiple pairs of jeans?

11
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,942
Dress it up, dress it down...

12
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,278
People know that when they wear them

13
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:48,669
they look cool.

14
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:52,604
This one garment can be both

15
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:57,298
universal and individual at the same time.

16
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,428
There is nothing like that
in the history of clothing.

17
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:02,924
And, in fact,
Yves Saint Laurent said he wished

18
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,686
he had invented jeans,
that he thought they were

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,309
the most important item of
fashion in the 20th century.

20
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,553
They wore them in the mines,

21
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,106
on the cattle trails.

22
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:17,318
My own father wore them toppling
200-foot Douglas firs.

23
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:20,080
Jeans are the quintessential
American garment.

24
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,636
120 years later, gentlemen,

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,226
blue jeans are still basically
the same pair of pants

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,298
that came out of the California Gold Rush.

27
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:34,611
But so much
of the story we tell about jeans

28
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,130
is a myth.

29
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,478
The strongest pants the West has ever seen.

30
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,687
It is about the cowboys, and the West,

31
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,310
it's about Levi Strauss,

32
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:44,932
and the Gold Rush.

33
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:47,969
It's always the same story...

âª <i>Bluejean bop, baby.</i> âª

36
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,802
After the cowboys, jeans got picked up

37
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:55,667
by rockers and bikers and hippies

38
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,151
and now everybody wears them.

But denim has been around

41
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,675
much, much longer.

42
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,299
It has a long and deep history

43
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,715
with so many other fascinating stories

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,993
that are not always told.

45
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,385
In 1850, Levi
Strauss invented the toughest pants

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,835
the West had ever known:

47
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,182
Levi's blue jeans.

48
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,667
Blue jeans do represent American culture

49
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:33,187
to the rest of the world,

50
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,294
but like any other good product of America,

51
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:38,917
you know, we, we borrow all the best ideas

52
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,814
from, from everywhere.

âª <i>Levi's</i> âª

54
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,197
The real fact of the matter is

55
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:46,200
that blue jeans themselves
originated somewhere else.

56
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,617
âª <i>That Levi's were
surely the best things of all</i> âª

57
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,862

58
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:56,935
âª <i>To roll out of
America's West.</i> âª

59
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,248
The story of denim jeans

60
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,559
is so much more than Wrangler,

61
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,527
it's more than Levi Strauss,

62
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,771
especially when it comes to the material.

63
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,570
We're not quite sure
exactly where the fabric originated,

64
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:14,124
but there are several hints.

65
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,301
One is Dungri, India, where as
early as the 17th century,

66
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:21,028
they were creating
a coarse cloth for workers,

67
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:24,721
eventually called dungaree.

68
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:27,103
There's the Genoans of Italy,

69
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,794
who had a type of sail cloth

70
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,351
that was fashioned into work pants.

71
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:37,527
And there's Nimes, France,
where the cloth there was known

72
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:41,221
as "serge de Nimes."

73
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,739
Not always, but very often,

74
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:45,432
these various types of cloth
were dyed blue,

75
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:48,883
probably to hide dirt as much as anything.

76
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:53,440
So, we have blue "jean" from Genoa,

77
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:58,376
we have blue "de Nimes" or denim
coming from Nimes,

78
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,138
but when we make it into pants in America,

79
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:07,350
we end up morphing the garment
into blue jeans.

80
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,552
People don't necessarily
think about how their blue jeans

81
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:14,392
came to be blue.

82
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:16,266
Historically, that's because of
the indigo dye.

83
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:21,882
Centuries ago, indigo was said
to be worth its weight in gold.

84
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,713
Competition for it was so fierce
Europeans actually called it

85
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,268
the "devil's dye."

86
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,786
Indigo is in fact a weed.

87
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,722
The process of turning indigo
from this small green leaf

88
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:39,313
into a dye is a very delicate process;

89
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,936
so only the most skilled
are able to do this.

90
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:48,322
One of the neatest
things about dying with indigo

91
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,359
is the dye vat is green;
it's not blue.

92
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:57,573
And when you introduce a fabric
like denim to the dye vat,

93
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,644
it comes out green.

94
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:05,235
And then, as it oxidizes in
our atmosphere, it turns blue.

95
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,858
It is magic.

96
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,342
Indigo dyeing is magic.

97
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,903
In many cultures,
indigo cloth has a spiritual importance.

98
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:20,941
In Africa, the cloth
is considered the next layer

99
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:22,874
to the skin.

100
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:26,360
It holds the person's soul, their spirit.

101
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:34,713
Africans have had a long history
of working indigo and knew

102
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,060
the special process involved
in making the dye

103
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,095
and in dyeing cloth.

104
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,896
And of course many
African captives who became enslaved

105
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,554
in the new world brought with
them knowledge of how

106
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,901
to extract the blue from the plant,

107
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:54,595
and how to fix the blue to fabrics.

108
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,047
Indigo is one of the ways
in which slave-holding

109
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,395
became tied to the economic fortunes

110
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,466
of the colonial experiment in the Americas.

111
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,609
So in the mid-1700s, there was this labor

112
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:11,163
that had been extracted from Africa,

113
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,787
and indigo presents itself as this thing

114
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,721
with economic possibility.

115
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:18,205
And then when you add to it

116
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:22,140
moving the dye stuff from one
end of the world to the other,

117
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,038
it only increased in value.

118
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:28,111
And Eliza Lucas benefited enormously

119
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:31,839
from the impact of this trade.

120
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:35,705
Eliza Lucas has
been credited as literally producing

121
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,189
indigo in America.

122
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,227
She's been credited as a botanist.

123
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,816
She's even written about
in elementary school

124
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,404
and high school textbooks.

125
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:49,201
Eliza Lucas was the
daughter of a colonial governor.

126
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:51,031
She had studied botany,

127
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:56,139
and when Eliza was a teenager,
her father bought her,

128
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:59,902
among many other plants, indigo.

129
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,870
The gift came from perhaps Antigua.

130
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:03,871
The South needed something

131
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:07,116
to add to crop rotation, and tobacco

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,187
was something cultivated here.

133
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,672
Rice was cultivated here.

134
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,536
Adding indigo into your crop rotation

135
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,365
was a way to find additional profit.

136
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,992
Once Eliza gets
her hands on the indigo seeds,

137
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,063
it takes off in terms of production.

138
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:28,309
Indigo was a second cash crop
behind rice in South Carolina.

139
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,691
And on the eve of the American Revolution,

140
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:32,555
more than a million pounds of indigo

141
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,454
was being shipped overseas.

142
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,944
Eliza Lucas was probably one of
the most well-known producers

143
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,637
of indigo in colonial America.

144
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,088
But Eliza's hands weren't blue.

145
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,987
She didn't get her hands dirty
with the indigo crop.

146
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:54,715
The knowledge to grow indigo
came from enslaved people.

147
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,200
They're the ones that did
the work that allowed her

148
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,996
to become this great planter
that she's been credited for.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,933
Indigo really encapsulates

150
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:10,559
this problem of how do we begin
to tell the story

151
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:13,769
of captive people and how we document

152
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:16,668
their contributions in America,

153
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:20,327
and to the denim history in particular.

154
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:21,673
We know the names

155
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,537
of all the enslaved people that were owned

156
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,228
by the Lucas and Pinckney family.

157
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:29,992
"Isaac, Pompey,
Molly, and their child, Nanny...

158
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,166
Mary and her children,
Prince and Be..."

159
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,653
These are generations of families.

160
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,689
We're not just talking about
a husband and a wife,

161
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,209
or a mom and a dad.

162
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,900
We see grandparents on this list.

163
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,661
"Nanny and her children. Juno..."

164
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:47,285
They're the ones
that came from communities that dyed

165
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,564
all kinds of cloth in beautiful colors.

166
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,808
They're the ones that had
the knowledge of indigo

167
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,707
and created generations of wealth for these

168
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,675
white slave-holding families.

169
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,337
Back in the 19th century,

170
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:09,100
denim really dominated,
because it's a strong weave.

171
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:12,517
So with the rise in durable cotton goods,

172
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,108
denim made itself the accepted second skin

173
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,075
in terms of cloth that was
put into clothing

174
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,525
meant for laborious work.

175
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,460
As American cotton
manufacturing begins to sort of

176
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,428
find its footing in the 18-teens and 1820s,

177
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:30,570
mills in Rhode Island,
mills in Massachusetts,

178
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,814
mills in New Hampshire,
they need a source of cotton.

179
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:37,024
And the only source of cotton to
make these mills

180
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,508
economically viable

181
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,270
is cotton that's being grown
by enslaved men, women,

182
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,479
and children in the American South.

183
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,101
Cotton from Alabama,

184
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,621
cotton from Louisiana,

185
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,140
Texas cotton, Mississippi cotton,

186
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,349
cotton from Georgia,

187
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,489
cotton from Charleston.

188
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:56,492
It takes two pounds of cotton
to make a pair of jeans.

189
00:09:56,526 --> 00:10:00,082
When you follow
the trail of cotton being grown

190
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:05,328
in this country in the South,
being shipped to the North,

191
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:08,677
being woven into blue jeans,

192
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:12,646
and then being shipped down back
to the South,

193
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,647
where is it going?

194
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:15,028
Who's wearing it?

195
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,962
There's a database that's called
Freedom on the Move

196
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:20,481
that has cataloged and crowdsourced

197
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,830
runaway slave advertisements
from all over the United States.

198
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,007
So slavers would put an ad
describing the person

199
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,182
with detailed descriptions
of what they had on them

200
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,493
when they left.

201
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,278
What clothing they were wearing,
what type of clothing,

202
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,359
what color the clothing was.

203
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,915
"Had on when he left, dark
jeans clothes, and a black hat."

204
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,573
"He carried off a
blue cloth coat, one blue jeans,

205
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,610
and two or three pair
pantaloons."

206
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,544
"Has on a blue Kentucky
jeans coat and striped pants."

207
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,305
"... wore a brown jeans
coat, and blue jeans pants..."

208
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,962
"New brown jeans."

209
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,654
"Mixed jeans,
frock coat, and pantaloons."

210
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,690
"A pair of jeans pants."

211
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:01,143
"... a blue jeans homespun
dress coat."

212
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,041
And so you have
advertisements that have very

213
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:07,321
detailed information about enslaved people.

214
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,276
And enslaved people were,
in fact, wearing jeans.

215
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:15,364
This is a story in which
coerced labor produces a raw material

216
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:18,816
that is exported from one region
to a second region

217
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,440
and which is then sold back
in an ongoing cycle.

218
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,583
An increasing number of
American slaves will come

219
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,412
to be wearing cloth that's manufactured

220
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:33,416
in the United States, that
travels under a number of names,

221
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,487
that sometimes goes under

222
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:38,076
an umbrella category of
"Negro cloth."

223
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,830
This is one of the powerful
things about clothing, right?

224
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,428
The ways in which it can be
used, not only for individuals

225
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:48,604
to perform their own identity,
but also for the ways in which

226
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:51,124
a dominant society can stigmatize people.

227
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,441
So blue jeans

228
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:01,721
clearly existed,
clearly predated Levi Strauss.

229
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,654
You're looking at farmers,

230
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,277
you're looking at factory workers.

231
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,590
Miners were wearing denim.

232
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,754
The enslaved peoples of America

233
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,422
were clothed very often in denim.

234
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:19,290
Basically any type of labor, hard work,

235
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,741
that you can think of
in the late 19th century,

236
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,088
you would have found people wearing denim.

237
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,849
Jeans did exist,

238
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:27,954
but they ripped.

239
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:31,233
They ripped and they wore down

240
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,337
and they became tatters.

241
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:33,442
They became unusable.

242
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:34,684
They didn't last as long.

243
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:38,309
Anybody who has ever torn a seam

244
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:41,174
through exertion knows

245
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,659
that there are certain points
in garment structures

246
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:47,559
that are more stressed than others.

247
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:50,252
So Jacob Davis is really sort of
the unsung hero here.

248
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:56,120
Jacob Davis was a tailor in Reno, Nevada,

249
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:59,606
or somewhere thereabouts in the 1870s.

250
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:05,681
Nevada was, you know,
one of the great bonanzas at the time.

251
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,614
There's this enormous rush of people.

252
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:11,756
And great fortunes are made
there from mining gold.

253
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,139
But the greatest fortunes
that are made there are not made

254
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,555
by individual prospectors.

255
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,834
They're made by the people
who can sell goods to miners.

256
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:25,080
So this lady
approached Jacob Davis and she said,

257
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,909
"I have a portly husband
who continues to rip

258
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,290
"his work pants,

259
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:32,328
and I'd like you to construct
a sturdy pair for him."

260
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,918
So he thought, "Well,
I have all these washer

261
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:40,440
"and post rivets that people
put on these saddles.

262
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:42,304
"Let's add these to all these
places he keeps

263
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,512
ripping his pants."

264
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:45,755
So he adds them to places like

265
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,930
the fly and mouths of pockets,

266
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,726
and even onto the mouth of the back pocket,

267
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,728
which is a patch pocket.

268
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:54,523
Customer loved them.

269
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:56,249
Obviously, word of mouth spread.

270
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,286
Soon he had more customers
than he could handle,

271
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,013
and he wanted to scale up the business,

272
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:05,534
but he was one man in a
tailor shop in Reno, Nevada.

273
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,295
So he contacted Levi Strauss,

274
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,473
who was his dry good supplier
based in San Francisco,

275
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,441
and offered him a partnership deal.

276
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,468
He said, basically, "Let's go
into business together.

277
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:19,755
"We need a patent.

278
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,205
"We'll take out the patent,

279
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,483
"and then we can make these riveted pants,

280
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:26,417
because you have the wherewithal
to scale up."

281
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,384
Levi agreed.

282
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:32,906
The two of them filed for the
patent, and received it in 1873.

283
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,666
The basic design has not changed

284
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,600
in nearly a century and a half.

285
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:40,189
Today, every pair of Levi blue jeans

286
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,950
has six copper rivets

287
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:45,229
that ensure the longevity
of each pair of pants.

288
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,093
The rivets were crucial

289
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,647
in the design for durability.

290
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,786
It was like making

291
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,926
some kind of, you know,
armor for your body,

292
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,894
that could just hold up to anything.

293
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:59,381
With the addition of the copper rivets,

294
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:03,626
the product becomes the most
durable form of workwear

295
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:05,939
available to any working American.

296
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,806
I'm looking for the ultimate jeans!

297
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,157
Hya!

298
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,130
At the end of the 19th century,

299
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:27,547
Americans were still largely
working with their hands.

300
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:31,137
Nearly 70% of workers
were toiling on farms,

301
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,898
in factories, mines, or construction.

302
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:39,386
This, of course, created
a huge market for jeans.

303
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:40,999
But jeans initially weren't called jeans.

304
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,426
They were called waist overalls.

305
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,256
Overalls were so prevalent
in the culture that jeans were

306
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,983
just a truncated version of overalls

307
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,467
without the bib.

308
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,883
That's where the term
"waist overalls" comes from.

309
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,614
So 1890,

310
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,618
17 years of patent exclusivity
for this rivet reinforced pocket

311
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,345
by Levi Strauss and Company ends.

312
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,316
Now anyone can use the rivet
reinforced pocket that wants to,

313
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,042
and everybody does it.

314
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:17,217
Once they lose their patent protection,

315
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,047
there are rivets everywhere,

316
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,739
there are knockoff logos
and brands everywhere.

317
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,159
So you have
companies called Can't Bust 'Em,

318
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,885
Can't Rip 'Em,

319
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,198
and Never Rip and Never Wear Out.

320
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:36,443
There were brands
called Blackbear, Dubbleware, Dozfit.

321
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:37,789
And Fitsu.

322
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:38,894
Boss of the Road...

323
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:39,895
Tuf Nut.

324
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:40,929
Stronghold...

325
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,106
And so you have all these companies

326
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:48,041
trying to push their version
of the work pant

327
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:51,769
out into society,

328
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,601
and we start to see so much
evolution going on within jeans.

329
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,087
We started with
one pocket and a button fly.

330
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,674
There were no belt loops.

331
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,643
Most people wore suspenders.

332
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:07,785
But in mining you
can't have a strap over your shoulder

333
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,891
that could get snagged
and cause the mine to collapse.

334
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:15,793
So several folks had a rope tied
around the waistband.

335
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,829
Then a second pocket was added,

336
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:20,280
and there was also a waist cinch.

337
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:22,662
And then they added zippers...

338
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,112
Belt loops...

339
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,079
There was a rivet at the crotch.

340
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,116
People had been complaining
about it for years.

341
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,808
I think they were happy
to get rid of that rivet,

342
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,879
and that has never come back.

343
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:37,470
Denim was changing

344
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:41,198
and so was America.

345
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:43,121
That image of someone clad
in denim at the turn of

346
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:47,307
the 20th century is inevitably,
you know, romanticized.

347
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:53,865
And the reality is that people
of all different ages, races,

348
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,214
and genders were wearing denim
during this time.

349
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,319
Sharecroppers in the South,

350
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:02,736
Chinese immigrants on the
transcontinental railway...

351
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,497
As the word of the Gold Rush spreads

352
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:08,501
not only across the nation,
but across the whole world,

353
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,641
people really from all over the world

354
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:14,714
come through, and often stay in,
San Francisco.

355
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,294
Turning San Francisco overnight,

356
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,409
not only into a booming boom town,

357
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:25,345
but also into a place
where you have more diversity,

358
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,865
a more cosmopolitan place

359
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,626
than any other spot
on the face of the Earth.

360
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,044
There was a huge
nativist outcry in San Francisco

361
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,117
at the time...
the idea that other people

362
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,740
from elsewhere are coming to
take our jobs away.

363
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,849
The backlash galvanizes
an immense political movement,

364
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:50,336
who make it their central platform to

365
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,822
see the expulsion of Chinese labor.

366
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,829
There's a rise in racism
you do see in the 1880s and '90s...

367
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:03,038
"No Chinaman made your clothes,"

368
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:07,939
and "Made by white labor only."

369
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:11,288
Because Levi was
a San Francisco based company,

370
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:15,188
they decided, "Okay, we're not
hiring any Chinese people.

371
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,535
We're going to give the jobs to
the local white people."

372
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:22,954
I think it's a
challenge for us as we embrace

373
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,577
how we came to be here,

374
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:26,993
we have to embrace the whole
story and the whole history.

375
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,722
Jeans are a great example to
think about American history

376
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,472
and a way to go into parts
of American history

377
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,415
that we haven't always addressed.

378
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:45,080
During the Great
Depression and the Farm Securities Act,

379
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:48,704
and the contracting of
photographers to go about

380
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,880
the country to document everyday life,

381
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:55,849
denim became symbolic of our nation.

382
00:19:55,884 --> 00:20:00,716
You see people on the West Coast
wearing jeans,

383
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,409
and people laboring
in the ports and the shipyards.

384
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,858
You see people

385
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:08,137
in the Empire State sitting on
I-beams during lunch breaks.

386
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,624
And you see tobacco farmers
with sun-faded overalls

387
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,971
and it became this common identity

388
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,905
that I think helps the country

389
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,632
to still feel unified
even during dark times.

390
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,635
The
knives are cutting; the load piles high.

391
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,982
The sun beats down from the August sky.

392
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:28,468
We built our freedom and strength this way.

393
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:30,470
We're building it still together.

394
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:32,265
Up until about the 1930s,

395
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,613
denim was really worn out of necessity.

396
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,615
When we get together we're hard to stop.

397
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,376
Working together...

398
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,275
It wasn't until those
years and beyond that the product

399
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,796
went from a necessity to a fashion.

400
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,662
A lot of that had to do with this nostalgia

401
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,285
for the American West.

402
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,426
Hey, come back with them horses!

403
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,568
Thanks to westerns,

404
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:03,227
cowboys became the American figure

405
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,540
that kind of helped us get out
of the Great Depression

406
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,783
in a way.

407
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,026
We didn't have royalty

408
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,028
like in England and other
European countries,

409
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,340
but we had cowboys

410
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,824
wearing blue jeans.

411
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,308
Thank you so much.

412
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,748
They were our knights in shining armor.

413
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:20,002
Follow me, ma'am,
and you'll never go astray.

414
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,935
Right this way.

415
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,665
It's hard for people
today to really appreciate

416
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,565
how big the western was.

417
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,637
As the United States is
transformed from being

418
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,777
a rural and agrarian nation

419
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:40,816
to one in which most people
live in cities or towns,

420
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:44,372
there is a nostalgic embrace

421
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:46,684
of the frontier world lost,

422
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:50,654
and the cowboys in those
westerns almost always

423
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,688
were wearing jeans.

424
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:59,870
And yet, there's no question
that when we look more closely

425
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:03,667
at the ways in which jeans
come into the West,

426
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,186
the story turns out to be much
more problematic.

427
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:12,365
The stories we tell are all white people.

428
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,369
In fact, the reality of life
in the American West

429
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,061
was much more multi-ethnic.

430
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:22,375
You know, a significant portion
of the workforce

431
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,102
were people of color...

432
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,379
people from Mexico,

433
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,899
Native Americans,

434
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,408
African Americans
probably making up an eighth

435
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,972
to a quarter of the cowboy workforce.

436
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,563
So we have a much more complicated reality

437
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:40,911
that contrasts with the whitening

438
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,189
of those figures in the westerns.

439
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,730
Of course, Hollywood's take on the cowboy

440
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,405
was just the start of denim spreading

441
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,580
beyond the working class.

442
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:58,480
Now this shift is, is happening

443
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:02,415
in an era of huge economic schisms.

444
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,006
The vast majority of people
were really struggling

445
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,663
during the Great Depression,

446
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,803
but there continued to be

447
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:14,427
an elite class of individuals.

448
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,601
They still traveled.

449
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:17,085
They still shopped.

450
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,606
âª <i>If you want to be a cowboy</i> âª

451

âª <i>Just come along with me</i> âª

452
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,162
âª <i>If westward you'd be going.</i> âª

453
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,853
One consequence at the time

454
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:31,582
was that this idea of the
dude ranch came about.

455
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:33,481
The dude ranch was essentially

456
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:37,830
a getaway, like sort of a spa
getaway for wealthy Easterners.

457
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:40,349
âª <i>Get yourself some wooly chaps</i> âª

458
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:42,800

00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:47,115
âª <i>Then saddle up a wild mustang
and head out on the trail.</i> âª

460
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:48,530
Because of the collapse

461
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,982
of many of the sources of income
based on cattle ranching

462
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,087
and other traditional
agricultural pursuits,

463
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:56,124
many working cattle ranches

464
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,298
turned their attention to dudes,

465
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,231
which was a more reliable source of income.

466
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:04,891
âª <i>The dude ranch cowhands

but now it's quail on toast.</i> âª

468
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,069
Many of these ranches were very remote.

469
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:15,488

travel by train and horseback.

473
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:22,150
They accepted paying guests

to participate in all the ranch chores...

cowhand is acting as a guide</i> âª

477
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,919
âª <i>He's rounding up
the moonbeams</i> âª

478
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,163
âª <i>For the lady at his side</i> âª

479
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:36,751
âª <i>Yippee-ki-yay</i> âª
âª <i>Ki-yay</i> âª

480
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:40,375
This was particularly
an opportunity for women.

481
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:45,484
American society was still not
fully comfortable with the idea

482
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:49,384
of women wearing pants in the 1930s.

483
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:52,283
Bifurcated garments seemed so unladylike.

484
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,081
Vacationing was a secure laboratory...

485
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,119
especially for the women.

486
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:03,605
When they looked in the mirror,
which I think many dudines did,

487
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,390
they didn't see their old self
from Connecticut

488
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,540
or Rhode Island;

489
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:10,267
they saw a cowgirl from the movies.

490
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:16,411
Denim afforded many women the
ability to get dirty, to hunt,

491
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,551
to fish, to ride horses.

492
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,311
So I think blue jeans on a dude ranch

493
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:22,451
not only gave women the ability

494
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:24,177
to move more freely,

495
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:26,490
to experience their bodies
in different ways,

496
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,493
but perhaps also to sort of
think more freely,

497
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,358
to rethink their position
in American society.

498
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,295
This was one of
the first times that women felt

499
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,194
comfortable enough to say,
"Hey, you know what?

500
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:43,058
"I enjoy wearing that kind of clothing.

501
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,094
I'm going to do it."

502
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:45,509
So the American

503
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,513
blue jeans manufacturers
realized that there was

504
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,377
a substantial market to be conquered

505
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:56,037
by creating blue jeans lines for women.

506
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,453
So you start seeing the design of jeans

507
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,455
beginning to follow fashion

508
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:05,391
in a way that they didn't previously do

509
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:09,809
when they were strictly work pants.

510
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:16,229
Jeans entered the
world of fashion in the 1930s

511
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:18,369
because they functioned as a souvenir

512
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:23,340
and they also functioned as a
symbol of wealth and prestige.

513
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,861
Somewhat ironically,
the clothes of the working man

514
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:31,210
became a symbol that you
belonged to the leisure class.

515
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:38,873
That's the dichotomy
sort of represented in the juxtaposition

516
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:42,117
between the Dorothea Lange
photos of the Dust Bowl

517
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:45,017
and Lady Levi's in "Vogue."

518
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:48,192
They can co-exist

519
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:52,231
because there was this extreme
inequality in America.

520
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:06,970
Since October 16, 1940,

521
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:10,594
millions of American men
have joined the armed forces

522
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,046
to defend our country and
our democratic way of life.

523
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,944
For many men and women,

524
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,084
World War II was the first time
they wore jeans.

525
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,846
The minute
the ship left port, neckties were dropped.

526
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,021
The enlisted men wore dungarees
and the traditional white hats

527
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,127
were dyed blue.

528
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,611
Here are the men who will fight.

529
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,683
World War II is a moment where

530
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:33,652
denim goes global in a sense.

531
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:41,176
One result of Americans fighting
overseas was that the G.I.s,

532
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,075
when they were off duty,

533
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,767
were in many cases wearing blue jeans,

534
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:50,082
and the locals took notice

535
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,956
and thought, "Well,
they look like movie stars,

536
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,499
"they look cool.

537
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,613
They look like, you know,
what we want to look like."

538
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:03,164
There's a way in which during the 1940s,

539
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:07,099
because of the patriotism
around World War II,

540
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,413
denim almost became the blue

541
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:14,520
in the red, white, and blue
of the American flag.

542
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:16,625
âª <i>The riveting machine</i> âª

543
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,110
You know and Rosie the Riveter

544
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:20,664
is a kind of classic example of this.

545
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,691
âª <i>There's something
true about red, white, and blue</i> âª

546
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,289
âª <i>About Rosie the Riveter</i> âª

547
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:27,844
"Rosie the Riveter"
was a Norman Rockwell painting

548
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:30,881
that ended up on the cover of
"The Saturday Evening Post."

549
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:33,953
She was like the American everywoman,

550
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:38,647
who when the menfolk were away
fighting the war in Europe,

551
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:40,684
she pitched in,

552
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,272
she did her part.

âª <i>Rosie the Riveter.</i> âª

558
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,215
With so many of the men overseas,

559
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,113
something like six million

560
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,391
mothers and daughters
were suddenly going to work

561
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,668
on a daily basis,

562
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,809
and to a large extent wearing denim.

563
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:04,984
Waitress, salesgirls, housewives...

564
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,055
these girls are now ready
to tackle the work

565
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,919
of producing weapons and equipment

566
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:11,025
essential to our armed forces.

âª <i>Rosie, Rosie, Rosie, Rosie</i> âª

568
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:17,307
âª <i>Working on an assembly line.</i> âª

569
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,969
- A
- day of days for America and her allies.

570
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,042
How jubilant was the taste of victory.

571
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:30,147
How sweet the rewards of peace.

572
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,808
From all the scattered
battlefields, he returned home

573
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:40,295
again to find a soldier's welcome.

574
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:46,301
So, what happens
when the soldiers who were wearing

575
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,509
denim overseas come home?

576
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:49,718
They kept wearing denim.

577
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,790
Why not?
They're great pants.

578
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:52,953
They're comfortable.
They're durable.

579
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:54,378
They had gotten used to them.

580
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,001
They liked them.
Why not?

581
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:02,628
As the World
War II vets started to come back,

582
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:04,033
they obviously had been through a lot.

583
00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:06,770
They felt a lot of camaraderie.

584
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,187
They felt a lot of brotherhood
in the trenches.

585
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,775
And they come back

586
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,676
into a very staid,
kind of 9:00 to 5:00 lifestyle,

587
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:20,404
for some people it wasn't going to work.

588
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,997
But the combination
of a big motorcycle and denim,

589
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:28,688
that really works.

590
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:30,863
âª <i>He wore black denim
trousers and motorcycle boots</i> âª

591
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,556
âª <i>And a black leather jacket
with an eagle on the back.</i> âª

592
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:36,420
They've all got jeans on.

593
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:38,526
T-shirt with a cigarette pack
rolled up in it...

594
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,770
you look pretty tough.

595
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,807
Suddenly bikers have become
modern-day outlaws.

596
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,430
âª <i>Well, he never washed his
face and he never combed his hair</i> âª

597
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:49,709
âª <i>He had axel grease embedded
underneath his fingernails.</i> âª

598
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:52,333
So the idea of the outlaw,

599
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,955
which has always had

600
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,372
a stronghold on the American
popular imagination,

601
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:00,444
was actually promoted by the movies,

602
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,446
and linked in particular with jeans.

603
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,351
You know, we see that a lot

604
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:12,284
in the Hollywood of the 1950s,

605
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:14,148
classically represented by Marlon Brando

606
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:16,909
in the biker film
"The Wild One."

607
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,603
Brando's character, who was,
of course, the guy who's asked,

608
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,329
"What are you rebelling
against?"

609
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,331
Hey Johnny, what are you rebelling against?

610
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,886
And he says... What do you got?

611
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,188
Like, "I don't know what it is
that I'm rebelling against.

612
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:32,166
I'm just doing it."

613
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,308
All bets were off at that point.

614
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:39,104
A lot of the teenagers
may not have wanted to become

615
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:40,726
Wally or Beaver.

616
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,107
But my friends call me Beaver.

617
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:43,418
Well, may I call you Beaver?

618
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:44,419
I'd like you to be my friend.

619
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,387
Okay.

620
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:49,045
They were able to make the choice,

621
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,392
and part of that choice

622
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,360
was, you know, having jeans on.

623
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:58,986
The early
teens are years of upheaval and turmoil.

624
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,885
They're years of physical
and glandular change.

625
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,576
Parents of almost every child

626
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,855
find the age of puberty
or early adolescence

627
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,374
full of problems.

628
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:09,755
After World War II,

629
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,517
really the "teenager" as we now
know it came into being.

630
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:18,246
Their actions may seem
excessive but that's normal for teenagers.

631
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,800
They seem to spend hours in
completely useless activities.

632
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,631
Prior to World War II,

633
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:27,359
you were either a young person
living at home,

634
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,154
going to school,

635
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:31,190
or when you were finished with school,

636
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,813
then you entered the workforce.

637
00:32:33,848 --> 00:32:36,437
You were contributing to the family income.

638
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:38,325
âª <i>You rockin' and you rockin'
and you rockin' around</i> âª

639
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:39,888
âª <i>Hop, hop, hop everybody</i> âª

640
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,960
After World War II,

641
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,547
the middle class exploded.

642
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:45,135
Families could offer their kids

643
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,068
more leisure time,

644
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:48,483
more independence.

645
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:51,141
...the rock and roll
teenage cowboy.

646
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,556
The American consumer economy

647
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:55,490
was booming and it just became
the American way of life:

648
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:58,666
spend money, buy things,
dress up, you know,

649
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,943
move up the food chain.

650
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,186
Gather 'round, kiddies.

651
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,258
Today I'm going to give you
a quick look-see

652
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,605
at what the well-dressed teenager is doing

653
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:08,262
in the way of fun and fashion.

654
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,195
If teenagers decided to work,

655
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:12,852
they could use that money
for their own benefit,

656
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:13,967
for their own leisure time.

657
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,616
They could buy their own cars.

658
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,779
They bought their own records.

659
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,264
They sort of helped create rock and roll.

660
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:22,483
Teenagers... they're terrific.

661
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,074
Jeans got sort of

662
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:30,284
irreparably linked

663
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:32,182
with cool.

664
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:36,255
And coolness became the ideal
to strive for.

665
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,086
Kay's
mother may have other opinions of style

666
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,639
of what looks best.

667
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:44,022
But of course mother has
old-fashioned ideas.

668
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,678
It's like, "What mom and dad want to do?

669
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,577
"Oh my God.
I can't even talk to them.

670
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,062
I do not want to wear
what they're wearing."

671
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,133
The adolescent is self-centered.

672
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:53,997
The charisma of deviance is powerful.

673
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,932
Their sloppiness
is so deliberate as to be offensive.

674
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:06,113
So during the
1950s, denim becomes increasingly

675
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:11,532
associated with biker gangs
and juvenile delinquency.

676
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:16,123
There was a sort of fear,
I think, among adults that

677
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,676
if teenagers put on a pair of jeans,

678
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,644
they were automatically going
to become delinquents

679
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,233
in some way.

680
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:26,616
School systems
literally started banning blue jeans

681
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,963
because they identified
the kids who wore them

682
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,413
as the "bad seeds."

683
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,898
They were going to, you know,
beat up a little old lady

684
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:35,038
and steal her pocketbook or, or whatever.

685
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,078
The parents'
generation started to clamp down,

686
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,081
which caused a dip in sales.

687
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,530
Suddenly families were

688
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,222
shying away from buying blue jeans.

689
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,158
The denim companies start to get worried.

690
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,781
As a result, a lot of the major companies

691
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:57,302
band together to form what
they called the Denim Council.

692
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,928
More people than ever are wearing denim.

693
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,517
You'd have to look far and wide
to find an American of any age

694
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:07,381
who has never worn blue jeans.

695
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:11,902
So they start this
whole campaign first to try to counter

696
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:15,458
the "bad" blue jean look with
the "wholesome" blue jean look.

697
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:18,254
"This is the right way to wear jeans,"

698
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,152
and it's neat with a nice shirt

699
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:23,880
and this very kind of healthy-looking kid.

700
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,399
And then,
"This is the bad blue jean."

701
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,459
And so it's the more the kid

702
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,609
like with his hair hanging down, greasy,

703
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:29,610
and all that kind of stuff.

704
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:31,301
Like, see?
There is a difference.

705
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,614
You can be a good kid and wear blue jeans.

706
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,616
Denim is really great for sports.

707
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,721
Looks like this joker
is knocking himself out

708
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:40,379
trying to prove it.

709
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:43,417
Folks wear jeans to get the work done

710
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:45,798
and jeans to relax in.

711
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,513
They tried to create a National Denim Day.

712
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:48,525
They had all sorts of

713
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,631
campaigns around the country

714
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:56,257
which are all about
the discovery of America.

715
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,362
They are about cowboys,

716
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:00,503
they are about adventure,

717
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,367
and history.

718
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:05,059
Blue denim is
a symbol of our pioneering spirit.

719
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:07,820
It goes right back
to the beginning of America.

720
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:11,203
Men in blue denim opened up the old West,

721
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:14,310
and built our bridges and skyscrapers.

722
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:15,759
That series of advertisements

723
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:19,729
helped reverse the trend
away from blue jeans.

724
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,386
In the last few months

725
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,871
more applications for the
Peace Corps have come to us.

726
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:26,425
By the first years of the 1960s,

727
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,808
the Peace Corps, JFK's initiative

728
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:31,282
sending young Americans out
across the globe

729
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,707
to do good deeds,

730
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:35,296
they were actually dressed in blue jeans.

731
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,125
That was their uniform.

732
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,059
So no longer was it that

733
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:42,094
the bad kids were the only ones
wearing blue jeans.

734
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,057
One thing in particular
that's interesting about this period

735
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,966
is the denim companies

736
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,349
spend all this time in the 1950s

737
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:59,044
trying to get away from the rebel image

738
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:02,565
and then the 1960s happens.

739
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,223
Hippies
made a colorful scene with wild costumes,

740
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,190
uninhibited dancing,
and general high frolicking.

741
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:12,091
When we think about
the denim story in the 1960s,

742
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:15,198
we almost automatically think
of the hippies,

743
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,512
with their bellbottoms, and tie-dye,

744
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:22,930
but the hippies weren't the only
people wearing those clothes.

745
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:28,038
A man dies
when he refuses to stand up for justice.

746
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:31,559
A man dies when he refuses to take a stand

747
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:33,423
for that which is true.

748
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,805
So we're going to stand up right here.

749
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,428
The classic
image of the Civil Rights Movement

750
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,362
is Martin Luther King Jr.

751
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:46,505
and he and many of his closest partners

752
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,785
wore suits and button down shirts,

753
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,718
sort of a "Sunday best" approach.

754
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,858
We will be able to join hands

755
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:57,413
and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual,

756
00:37:57,447 --> 00:38:00,312
free at last, free at last,

757
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,935
thank God Almighty we are free at last.

758
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,456
Being a man of African descent,

759
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:10,495
a lot hinged on his self-representation.

760
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:11,762
He needed to present himself to the world

761
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:13,636
as a respectable person,

762
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,248
because there was already
a notch against him

763
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:16,328
for being a Black man.

764
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:21,299
The focus on the Sunday best

765
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:26,096
has obscured the fact that
at that time there were

766
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,479
these young college students who say,

767
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:32,240
"Instead, we're going to wear
denim because we want to show

768
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:35,347
"that our political bonds
are to the Black working poor

769
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:37,970
and not to the Black bourgeois."

770
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:43,321
These young people, once they
left Howard University,

771
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:48,671
Fisk University,
Tougaloo College, to head south,

772
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:51,432
say, "We're going to wear
this denim alongside

773
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,711
"the working class and
sharecroppers who had been

774
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,679
"trying for decades

775
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:59,578
to fight for their right
to vote."

776
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:03,064
They were rebels with a cause.

777
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,861
âª <i>Freedom</i> âª

778
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,208
âª <i>Freedom</i> âª

779
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:12,315
âª <i>Freedom, freedom.</i> âª

780
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,249
For young Black
protesters, it absolutely is risky

781
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:16,975
with what they're wearing

782
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:20,219
because they already have
the systemic pressure

783
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:23,395
up against them presuming that they are

784
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,432
of a lower class or status in society.

785
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:29,090
And so wearing a certain style
of dress that is aligned

786
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,368
with the laboring class,

787
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,680
that is absolutely bold.

788
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:34,164
âª <i>Hold on</i> âª

789
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,339
âª <i>Hold on.</i> âª

790
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,032
As this Southern
movement spreads and garners

791
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,069
national media attention,

792
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:46,418
you now have white students
who decide to go south

793
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,316
to help with the organizing.

794
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:52,873
âª <i>We are all here, Black and white</i> âª

795
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:56,359
So when those white students go back north,

796
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,706
they go back wearing denim.

797
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:01,606
âª <i>Hold on, hold on.</i> âª

798
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,505
This becomes the look of youth rebellion

799
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,920
in the 1960s.

800
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:17,207
âª <i>Baby, don't call me a liar</i> âª

801
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:20,452
They represent
a new form of social rebellion.

802
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,628
They dress in bizarre and colorful ways.

803
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,215
Hippies are very interesting...

804
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,529
The 1960s is a
pivotal point in the history of denim.

805
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,531
They are hip, onto something good.

806
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:32,257
Just like for the Civil Rights Movement,

807
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,328
for the hippies,

808
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:37,642
clothing was a form of political activism.

809
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,323
Of course it's a
whole different way of living,

810
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,497
it's a whole different way of thinking.

811
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:45,166
So many of the civilians have no concept.

812
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,236
But it's fun.

813
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:47,893
It's fun to be bizarre.

814
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:51,138
There was
such an emphasis with the counterculture

815
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,243
on creativity, on individuality,

816
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,453
self-expression.

817
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,493
People then embellished their jeans.

818
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:04,565
They sewed fringe on them...

819
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,842
They put feathers.

820
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:07,810
They were patched...
- Painted...

821
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:10,468
Embroidered and shredded...

822
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:11,745
All of the sudden your jeans

823
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:13,747
were your canvases.

824
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:18,510
There was a cool factor.

825
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:22,790
And when rock stars and
musicians started wearing denim,

826
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,896
it became even cooler.

827
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,761
There was The Who, and Janis Joplin,

828
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:33,525
and the Doors, the Rolling
Stones, Led Zeppelin.

829
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,965
So then everyone wanted to wear them.

830
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:39,151
âª <i>By the time we got to Woodstock</i> âª

831
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:40,774
"Woodstock"... that movie

832
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:44,812
completely expanded our idea of fashion.

833
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:47,125
I know for me being this kid
in North Carolina,

834
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,161
when I saw that movie, I'm like,

835
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:52,268
"I want to
wear clothes like that."

836
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,512
âª <i>A little help
from my friends</i> âª

837
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:59,862
Denim was the uniform of that generation,

838
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:02,520
and a lot of the denim companies

839
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:04,107
started to capitalize on that.

840
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,698
It's interesting
to look at that case study of Levi's,

841
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:13,496
because in the 1950s
they tried so hard to get away

842
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,740
from the counterculture.

843
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,845
And then by 1971,

844
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,676
they use an aerial shot of the crowd

845
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,988
at a music festival

846
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:28,235
and just slap a Levi's logo
on it, and that's it!

847
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,245
It's been said
that "Those children of the '60s

848
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:44,009
came in as a tribe
and went out as a market."

849
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,011
They were the market for blue jeans.

850
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:54,192
By the time you get into the early '70s,

851
00:42:54,226 --> 00:42:57,298
hippie chic is everywhere.

852
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:01,682
The fashion industry becomes wildly taken

853
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:04,616
with these young radicals.

854
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:08,965
You have designers with ads
that suggested that,

855
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,210
"The real freedom movement
is in your jeans."

856
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:15,627
It is ironic, isn't it?

857
00:43:15,662 --> 00:43:17,595
Rewind like a decade earlier,

858
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,667
youth were sort of wearing denim
as a form of rebellion.

859
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:24,636
By the time we get to the 1970s,
like denim is being commodified.

860
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:27,984
The fashion industry co-opts

861
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,229
authentic subcultural styles

862
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:33,956
and then makes them part of the system.

863
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,616
Whether it seems dangerous
or seems totally trivial,

864
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,758
the fashion industry takes any
cool look or stance

865
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:46,071
and markets it if sees an audience for it.

866
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:51,318
We start to see
denim jeans become just a very

867
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:52,802
lucrative product.

868
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:56,841
They were really a great blank canvas

869
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,774
for designers to express themselves.

870
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:03,295
When I was 16 years old,

871
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,333
I was enamored with music and musicians,

872
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:10,164
and I couldn't play
so I couldn't be a musician,

873
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,994
but I wanted to look like a rock star.

874
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:17,344
So I opened a small shop
called People's Place

875
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:18,863
and started selling jeans.

876
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:22,314
At one point I was thinking,
"I think I could design

877
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:25,386
better jeans than we're buying
from vendors."

878
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,080
The fashion industry realizes

879
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:31,496
that there's this massive market

880
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,705
for all things denim.

881
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,296
Now it's sleek, high-rise, tight...

882
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,129
There becomes a certain kind of
glamor associated with jeans

883
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:45,303
for the first time.

884
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,824
It was a turning point,

885
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,792
which became the era of designer jeans.

886
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:54,657
There was Gloria Vanderbilt,

887
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,969
Calvin Klein...

888
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:57,729
There was Halston...
- Sasson...

889
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:00,145
- Fiorucci...
- Sergio Valente...

890
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,734
We were really trying to outdo

891
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,529
one another with sexiness.

892
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:11,881
But when Brooke Shields, as a young teen,

893
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:16,852
was the Calvin Klein poster
girl, I think heads turned.

894
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:19,786
You wanna know what comes
between me and my Calvins?

895
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,994
Nothing.

896
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:22,789
Calvin Klein Jeans.

897
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,963
Everyone said,
"Okay, well, this is going to

898
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:26,620
a whole new level."

899
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:28,864
âª <i>You've got the
look I want to know better</i> âª

900
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:32,281
It is like a tidal
wave over the whole industry.

901
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,767
People started actually

902
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:38,701
verbalizing what everyone
had known for a hundred years,

903
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,772
that blue jeans are sexy.

904
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:45,328
âª <i>Jordache
has the fit that's right.</i> âª

905
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:47,848
By the late '70s, designer jeans

906
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:52,163
were chipping away
at the fashion hierarchy.

907
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:55,476
They make it acceptable for anyone

908
00:45:55,511 --> 00:46:00,136
to wear a pair of jeans
at any time or place.

909
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:05,728
Jeans undermine the idea
of what fashion was supposed to be.

910
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,869
They were part of a more general
democratization of fashion.

911
00:46:10,388 --> 00:46:13,218
It suddenly became possible to wear jeans

912
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:15,911
in almost all settings.

913
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,776
âª <i>Hip hip hop
and you don't stop</i> âª

914
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,457
âª <i>We rock it out, baby, boppa
to the boogity bang bang</i> âª

915
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:22,503
âª <i>Boogie to the boogie,
the beat</i> âª

916
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:26,714
In the late 1970s
around the Bronx in New York City,

917
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,993
we start to see hip hop emerge.

918
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:31,996
And denim jeans become this
sort of a uniform.

919
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,137
âª <i>You see I'm six
foot one and I'm tons of fun</i> âª

920
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,001
âª <i>And I dress to a T</i> âª

921
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,855
âª <i>You see I got more clothes
than Muhammad Ali</i> âª

922
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:40,936
âª <i>And I dress so viciously</i> âª

923
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,525
For African Americans,
a pair of designer jeans

924
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,424
came with a lot of value.

925
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,944
That's why we get language
coming straight out of hip hop,

926
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:52,223
like "fresh," "dope," "fly."

927
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:54,397
âª <i>And the rest is F-L-Y</i> âª

928
00:46:54,432 --> 00:46:57,815
You know, because that spoke
to the value of clothing.

929
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:00,058
âª <i>Everybody go hotel...</i> âª

930
00:47:00,093 --> 00:47:03,613
Hip hop changed denim in a very big way.

931
00:47:03,648 --> 00:47:08,446
The hip hop stars started going
on tour and doing MTV videos

932
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,863
wearing really cool clothes.

933
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:16,834
The way in which it was worn
was very different.

934
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,042
âª <i>Oh my Lord</i> âª

935
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:20,251
âª <i>Another corn chopped by the
Wu-Tang sword</i> âª

936
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:22,149
âª <i>Hey hey hey</i> âª

937
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:25,083
In the early '80s, with bands like Run DMC,

938
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,878
it's just more of a straight look,

939
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:28,328
but then it becomes more baggy.

940
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:31,400
âª <i>Blow up your project
then take all your assets</i> âª

941
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:33,574
âª <i>'Cause I came to shake
the frame in half</i> âª

942
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:36,957
And then they started
to wear brands like Ralph Lauren,

943
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:40,202
and Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger.

944
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:43,239
Those brands represented a lifestyle that

945
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:46,242
historically African Americans
had been excluded from.

946
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:49,590
I want to thank Snoop Doggy Dog
and everybody on the show.

947
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,937
So wonderful...

948
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:54,699
I mean when we think about those brands,

949
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:58,358
we think about the country club
or yachting.

âª <i>Even swing the pole at the
hole in my golf course</i> âª

953
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:06,538
By putting a brand like

954
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:09,127
Ralph Lauren or Tommy Hilfiger
on their backs,

955
00:48:09,162 --> 00:48:11,405
they were changing the meaning
of the brand.

956
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,786
This brand that's associated

957
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,823
with all-American identity
or whiteness becomes associated

958
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:17,895
with like hip hop culture.

964
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:33,358
Not only do we
see hip hop artists able to remix

965
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:34,981
sounds, and, you know,

966
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:37,328
like in music, but they're also
able to take clothing

967
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:40,158
and remix it for their own means.

968
00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:41,711
âª <i>Yeah, yeah</i> âª

969
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:45,474
To get your hands
on that clothing and wear it

970
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:46,993
is subversive in a way.

971
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:49,295
Because it is saying, "I'm not
supposed to be wearing this,

972
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:50,479
but look at me, I am."

973
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,241
Hip hop really helped to take command

974
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:56,485
of the denim narrative.

975
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:58,211
Bring it!

976
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:05,114
K7 and the Swing Kids!

977
00:49:05,149 --> 00:49:06,253
Peace!

978
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:24,030
Jeans are probably
the single most iconic garment

979
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:26,308
of the 20th century.

980
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,757
Each generation

981
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:31,485
keeps rediscovering how jeans
can be meaningful for them.

982
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,532
Blue jeans are an amazing thing

983
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:44,740
for anyone trying to tell

984
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,985
a broader history of the United States.

985
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,194
It allows you to talk about slavery.

986
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:54,853
It allows you to talk about
fashion and consumerism.

987
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:57,580
It allows you to talk about cool
and the invention of cool.

988
00:49:57,615 --> 00:50:01,412
And to have all of these things
under the same heading

989
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:02,965
is really quite remarkable.

990
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,731
Denim and its history is a perfect metaphor

991
00:50:10,766 --> 00:50:16,530
for where we find ourselves
as a culture right now.

992
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:21,225
Becoming much more aware of the silences,

993
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:25,229
of those groups

994
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:28,922
that have been pushed to the side.

995
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:32,857
Exposing and celebrating

996
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:35,653
these narratives that haven't made it into

997
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:39,691
that typical telling of jeans

998
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:43,247
is part of the work to change
our understanding

999
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:44,627
of American history.

1000
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,705
It's a long journey from "Negro cloth"

1001
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,607
to hip hop denim and baggy jeans
ruling the denim market

1002
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,230
in the 1990s.

1003
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:05,510
As I sit here in a denim jacket,
you know, it's clear to me that

1004
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:09,307
we can see the rich tapestry
of where we've been as a people,

1005
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:13,208
as a nation.

1006
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:17,591
The thing about the denim jean

1007
00:51:17,626 --> 00:51:21,147
is it tells a story about who we are.

1008
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:24,702
It's a garment that's almost
like keeping the fingerprints

1009
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:26,393
of our history...

1010
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:30,880
the creases, the tears, all of it.

1011
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,217
You know, you can repair it all you want,

1012
00:51:32,227 --> 00:51:35,471
mend it all you want,
but the scars of that, you know,

1013
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:37,508
the memory, that material memory

1014
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:38,923
will remain there.

1015
00:51:39,305 --> 00:52:39,651
