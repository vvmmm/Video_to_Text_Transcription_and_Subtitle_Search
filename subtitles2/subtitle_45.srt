Does she know
why you're in Barfield?

315
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,616
No, Ms. Hewitt.

316
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,313
She just knows I've been in
for a long time.

317
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,989
Eighteen years.

318
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,783
Is she aware that it is unlikely
that you'll be up for parole

319
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,057
for some considerable time?

320
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,795
We haven't discussed it.

321
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,136
You haven't had a visit prior
to Ms. Purvis for four years.

322
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,208
That is correct.
And I appreciate her kindness.

323
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,340
She's a very nice, respectable,
trusting lady.

324
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,010
Make sure, Wilfred,
that you do not abuse her trust

325
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,056
or abuse the trust
that we have in you

326
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,388
in allowing you to be
in the musical.

327
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,983
I won't.

328
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,519
I appreciate her kindness
very much.

329
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,958
Good.

330
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,092
Thank you, Mr. Samuels.

331
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,070
- Thank you.
- Governor.

332
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,903
I mean...
what am I supposed to do?

333
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,472
I go into exercise,
and he's starting on at me.

334
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,849
I go into the showers,
and he's goading me.

335
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,320
He's trying to make me lose
my rag.

336
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,854
And I am telling you
that unless he's moved,

337
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,191
I'm going to have to take him.

338
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,258
I can't keep turning away.
Understand me?

339
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,828
I can't not face him,
because I am losing face.

340
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,066
Understand what I'm saying
to you?

341
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,700
It's making me all tensed up.

342
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,641
I can't sleep
for thinking about it

343
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,944
because he won't leave me alone.

344
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,382
People are always getting at me.

345
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,684
I'm not doing anything.

346
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,585
But, Bert, you know
that it's to do with you.

347
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,458
You become aggressive
very easily

348
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,054
and over the smallest thing.

349
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,690
Now, you're telling me

350
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,235
that this most recent
altercation started...

351
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:34,366
Brian Samora took my chair
in the television lounge.

352
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,875
I always sit in that chair.

353
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,639
He knew it was my chair!

354
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,237
No, Bert, you don't.

355
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,011
You've only just moved
onto the wing.

356
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,643
So perhaps you took
Brian Samora's chair.

357
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,153
Morning.

358
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:49,684
Morning.

359
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,247
Morning.
Carlos, how's the new baby?

360
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,622
Beautiful, Ms. Hewitt.
Thank you.

361
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,058
Good.

362
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,323
Morning, Eugene.
How's the musical going?

363
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,240
Uh, could do with a bit more
rehearsal, Ms. Hewitt,

364
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,926
but it's all right.

365
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,968
I hear you've asked
to be back in the show, Brian.

366
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,731
Yeah. I wondered if I could get
me old part back now I'm back.

367
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,804
[Chuckles]

368
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,534
I don't think
that'll be possible, Brian.

369
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,540
But now that you are back...

370
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,601
Not that I think it's anything
to be quite so cheerful about...

371
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,589
I hope you'll continue
with your education program.

372
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,206
Oh, yeah.
I will, Ms. Hewitt.

373
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,561
Thank you very much, Ms. Hewitt.

374
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,083
Mean cow.

375
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,313
I heard that, Mr. Samora.

376
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,344
HADDOCK:
Ms. Hewitt.

377
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,414
Mr. Haddock, I hear you've got
a big leading role.

378
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,290
I was supposed to be playing
Nanki-Poo, but...

379
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm looking forward
to the performance.

380
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,361
They're making me play a girl,

381
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,830
and I learned all the lines
for Nanki-Poo.

382
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,897
[Singsong voice]
Ja-a-a-son!

383
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,873
Ja-a-a-son!

384
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,309
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

385
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,941
I am saying
that I am being got at.

386
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,386
Bert, will you do something
for me?

387
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,349
Tonight, when you're watching
television...

388
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:03,556
If that prick sits in my chair,
I'll do something about it!

389
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,359
Just a minute.

390
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,924
I am telling you
that I'll wrap it over his head,

391
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,061
then I'll put my foot
through the TV!

392
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,697
People are always getting at me.

393
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,211
Come on, Bert.

394
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,473
I've seen Mr. Samuels,

395
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,777
and to be honest,
there is little that I can do.

396
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,444
If Ms. Purvis wishes to visit
him, then I can't really refuse

397
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,249
because I have no grounds
to do so.

398
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,448
I need me medication.

399
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,615
How is he coming along?

400
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,851
He's not.

401
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,086
He's suffering
from deep paranoia.

402
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,062
I don't think he's stable enough
to be on an ordinary wing.

403
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,995
Make sure
the wing governor knows

404
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,057
and we'll see
where we can move him.

405
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,964
Ja-a-a-son!

406
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,869
- Shut it!
- Ooh. Ooh.

407
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,965
- Shut up!
- Jason!

408
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,312
Jason!

409
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,507
Are your pants dry yet?

410
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,642
Officer Hully?
A moment.

411
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,321
SMITH:
Ja-a-a-son!

412
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,223
Ja-a-a-son!
Are your pants dry yet?

413
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,454
Could you excuse us a second?
Thank you.

414
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,724
Are you settling in all right?

415
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,765
- Only I noticed...
- [Sighs]

416
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,630
It's Keith Smith, Ms. Hewitt.

417
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,432
Ever since I got here, he's
done it, and it drives me nuts.

418
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,269
I know I'm supposed to
ignore it.

419
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,639
Try not to let it get to you.

420
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,438
Thank you.

421
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,002
SMITH:
Ja-a-a-son!

422
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,674
Ja-a-a-son!

423
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,082
Ja-a-a-son!

424
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,642
Hey, Eugene.

425
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,087
Do you reckon it's sort of,
like, psychological,

426
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,489
you know, sort of like sublime,
me getting banged up again?

427
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,788
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

428
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,489
- You mean you're a pillock.
- [Chuckles]

429
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,964
I want you to do something
for me.

430
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,945
- I'll pay you in smokes, yeah?
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

431
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,904
Hang on.
Wait a minute.

432
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,234
What do you want us to do?

433
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,239
That prick Keith Smith.

434
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,118
He's been having a real go at me
since I came here.

435
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,203
I'd just like him given
a bit of a thrashing.

436
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,610
- Beat him up, yeah?
- Yeah.

437
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,172
I mean, not too much.
I don't want him hospitalized.

438
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,912
Just... Well, I don't have to
spell it out, do I?

439
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,454
I don't know, you know?
Keith Smith?

440
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,183
He's down on the I's.

441
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,656
We're stuck up here.

442
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,192
How are we supposed to get
to him?

443
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,854
I'll leave his cell unlocked,
maybe just after association.

444
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,193
Yeah. Come on.
That's got to work.

445
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,358
Well, Keith Smith,
he's a Cockney.

446
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,267
Got loads of mates down here.
You know what I mean?

447
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,336
I've got an idea.
Yeah.

448
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,998
We go in there,
give him a few whacks,

449
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,200
he's gonna know we did it.

450
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,800
Yeah. He wouldn't know who
done him if we had a mask on.

451
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,606
- Can you get any balaclavas?
- Yeah.

452
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,348
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks.

453
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,247
[Door closes]

454
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,218
Everything's on the level.
Come on.

455
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,219
If he's on the level,

456
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,831
we'll get more than a few smokes
out of this.

457
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,687
We're not doing anything.
Don't be crazy.

458
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,248
That's what he's just asked us
to do.

459
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,452
You're a shithouse.

460
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,471
You've been saying you're
gonna do Smith in for ages.

461
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,259
- Hey! Yeah. Yeah.
- You have! You have!

462
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,698
That's between cons,
not some screw paying us.

463
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,496
Yeah.

464
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,197
It's a liberty man,
a bloody liberty.

465
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,761
Well, you can't trust a screw.

466

it was necessarily anything
to do with you.

that you're visiting one of
the prisoners, writing to him,

no knowledge of prisons.

You've never been inside one

able to make any judgment

about whether a man
is trustworthy or not.

Well, he's got no family
and had no visits.

for armed robbery

and a further sentence for
the murder of a police officer.

00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,467
but, I mean, a fall wouldn't do
this much injury.

1094
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:37,640
I'm not making any accusations,
Gary, but somebody did this.

1095
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,207
Now, he should <i>never</i> have been
accepted back to Barfield

1096
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,582
in this condition.

1097
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,212
But he was,
so he's now our responsibility.

1098
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,450
DR. HARRIS:
Hey, he's conscious.

1099
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,457
Just.

1100
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,086
- âª So I'm walking âª
- [Mumbling]

1101
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,655
âª Yes, I'm walking âª

1102
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:58,032
âª I'll keep on walking âª

1103
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,594
âª Talking my way... âª

1104
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,867
Baby.

1105
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,406
Baby.

1106
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,912
I doubt we'll ever find out
who did it.

1107
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,174
You want to bet?

1108
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,225
I want to see the reception
officer, the wing governor,

1109
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,309
the duty governor,
and the principal officer.

1110
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,947
Oh. Gary, whose decision was it
to cancel the musical?

1111
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,014
Well, I suppose it was mine.

1112
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,184
I've had a tough enough fight
with the P.O.A.

1113
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,259
to keep that show going,

1114
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,228
so you can relay
to all those concerned

1115
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,788
that the musical goes ahead
as arranged.

1116
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:29,333
Who's going to oversee it?

1117
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,527
If necessary, I will.

1118
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,593
It's about time
I made my presence felt.

1119
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,048
It's time that everyone realized
I'm the governor of Barfield.

1120
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,405
- Governor.
- Gate 11 opening.

1121
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,476
- The show goes on?
- Yes. The show goes on.

1122
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:41,876
Governor.

1122
00:49:42,305 --> 00:50:42,746
