ï»¿1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Listen to me, Saaz.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,560
Where are you going?

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,760
Try to understand, Saaz.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,520
Why are you being so stubborn?

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,200
Let's go back to Kolkata.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,000
Your visa is in process.
You'll fly off to USA soon.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,080
I've made all the arrangements
in Berkeley.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,800
Why waste your time here?

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,520
Dad, the police might not find
any abnormalities.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,160
But take it from me.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm sure Mom and Salamat Uncle
have been murdered

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,960
- That's ridiculous...
- Even Alap thinks so.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,360
Trust me.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
That murderer is definitely somewhere
near Anandagarh.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
And he's up for a bigger mission.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,480
He deserves to be punished.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
I can't run away like a coward
until he is punished.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
Saaz...

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,240
please listen to me.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,440
This might put your life at risk.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
- Bahadur said so too.
- I don't care what others say.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,080
I can't just escape.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,440
I've never disobeyed you and Mom.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,840
But please...

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
don't ask me to do this.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,320
I can't keep running away
from my guilty conscience

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,040
for the rest of my life.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,040
I can't, Dad.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Saaz, liste...

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Saaz.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,520
Greetings, maâam.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,720
Huh?

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,200
How's your mother?
Is she okay now?

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,360
You could've stayed with her
for a few more days.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Since you said she stays alone.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
She asked me to come back.

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Because I was missing out
on rehearsals.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
Very well.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,920
Rest for a while.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,400
- We'll rehearse later.
- Okay, ma'am.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Hmm.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,000
The police commissioner in my village

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,600
asked me to visit the police station
when I get here.

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,760
I followed his instructions.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
- Fine.
- Okay.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Come in, Bahadur.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
- Did you repair the tabla?
- Yes.

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,520
Great.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,920
It's good to see
you're back to normal.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
- New student?
- Hmm?

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes.

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
He has a wonderful voice.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
But he's very poor.

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,480
With proper guidance,
he'll go a long way.

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
We need to find out
more about him.

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Things started going wrong
since he came here.

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,960
The police are already investigating it.

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,799
Besides, seven other students
have been admitted with him.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,920
Hmm.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,040
Then all of them are suspects.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
What's his name?

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,680
Naad Shankar... Das.

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Naad Shankar Das.

CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2

77
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
Damn it!

78
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Uff!

79
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,400
Alap.

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,680
Alap.

81
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,800
Naad took the box and the disc.

82
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,120
With the disc!

83
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Alap, he escaped.

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
Doesn't matter.

85
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,240
- What?
- He'll have to come back to me.

86
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll kill that rascal!

87
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,880
- Bahadur Uncle.
- Yes?

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Who is this Naad?

89
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
Someone from Rudrapur?

90
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,520
He killed my son and daughter.

91
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,440
And your sister?

92
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
Who killed your sister?

93
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
What do you mean?

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,720
Found this pen
at Master Kedar's farmhouse.

95
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,520
There's a symbol on the nib.

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
We saw the same symbol...

97
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,520
on Salamat Uncle
and Noor Aunty's dead bodies.

98
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,520
It's there on Naad's back as well.

99
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,480
How is Master Kedar
connected to this symbol?

100
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,840
We thought Master Kedar was like you,
a descendant of Madanti.

101
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,040
That maybe to protect himself...

102
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,760
he concealed his identity
and lived in Anandagarh.

103
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,920
But it seems
that he had other intentions.

104
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,760
What are you saying?

105
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,040
Bahadur Uncle...

106
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
please tell us what happened.

107
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,640
Did Grandpa want
to kill Grandma?

108
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
I don't know!

109
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,160
I don't know.

110
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,240
I don't know anything.
Please spare me!

111
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,760
Fine.

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,240
We'll let you go.

113
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
But let me make this clear.

114
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
I will get to the bottom of this.

115
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
Let's go, Shruti.

116
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,840
This solitude is painful

117
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,120
Make me yours

118
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,240
The burning candles call out

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Put them out

120
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Come let's explore each other

121
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Will the night ever end

122
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,440
If we make love?

123
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,240
This solitude is painful

124
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,720
Make me yours

125
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,640
The burning candles call out

126
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,200
Put them out

127
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,400
Come let's explore each other

128
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,520
Will the night ever end

129
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,760
If we make love?

130
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,120
This solitude is painful

131
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,160
Make me yours

132
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,960
Your burning touch
Melts this fragile glass

133
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,800
I lose myself
In your passionate glance

134
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,400
I give in To your loving touch

135
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,160
The stars hold the secret
To your passionate glance

136
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,560
This solitude is painful

137
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,640
Make me yours

138
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,320
The burning candles call out

139
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,160
Put them out

140
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,440
Come let's explore each other

141
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Will the night ever end

142
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,000
If we make love?

143
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,520
This solitude is painful

144
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
Make me yours

145
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
Are you sure it was this symbol?

146
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
Yes, brother.

147
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Remember what you told me?

148
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,440
To let you know
if I see someone with this symbol.

149
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,360
What does this symbol mean?

150
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
Mumtaz.

151
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,680
Kedar Mishra is not a nice man.

152
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,560
He wants to kill you.

153
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,440
- What?
- Yes.

154
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
What are you saying?

155
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,840
It can't be true.

156
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,880
I don't believe you...

157
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
Ask Grandfather
if you don't believe me.

158
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,440
But don't worry.

159
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,800
Nobody can harm you
as long as I'm alive.

160
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,160
Hail Rudrabhairav!

161
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,640
What's the matter, Naad?

162
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,080
Why is it taking so long
to finish the work?

163
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,720
I request you to have patience.

164
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm on it.

165
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,720
Huh! Are you?

166
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,320
Or has the Nawab's granddaughter
made you forget your resolve?

167
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,120
Hmm?

168
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,160
Naad, I sent you here

169
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,840
to find Madanti's descendants
and finish them.

170
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,440
I arranged for Nawab Amanat Khan
to give you music lessons.

171
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,080
What for?

172
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,440
Only so that you can stay here.

173
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Your suspicion is baseless..

174
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,080
I was the one who found
and killed Madanti's son Abdul.

175
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,840
That was long back.

176
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,640
What's taking you so long
to find Abdul's descendants?

177
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm almost done.

178
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,280
I will bring the corpse before you soon.

179
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,080
Listen, Naad.

180
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,360
You wanted freedom from your life as Naad
after marrying Mumtaz.

181
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,560
I have not objected to that.

182
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
But if you don't finish the job...

183
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,160
I'll destroy your family.

184
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I give you seven more days.

185
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,600
Proceed.

186
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,840
Rascal!
You want to kill my sister?

187
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,440
I'll finish you before that...

188
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,480
You better not reveal
anything you heard.

189
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,160
Or there'll be consequences.

190
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,920
Please come, Rudrabhairav.

191
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,240
He was Abdul's only son.

192
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,120
He was in hiding.

193
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
I've found out
that Abdul does not have anymore children.

194
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,440
Madanti's lineage ends with him.

195
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,840
Please release me now.
