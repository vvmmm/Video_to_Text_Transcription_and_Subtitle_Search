will want to know

why five men were allowed
in that cell.

629
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,441
Yes.
That is correct.

630
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,779
And before taking over
the running of Barfield Prison,

631
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,514
you were deputy governor
at Kettering Hall,

632
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,885
an all-female prison?

633
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,719
Yes.
That is correct.

634
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,190
KNATCHBULL:
You took over Barfield

635
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,159
after the highly publicized
riot.

636
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,718
My lord,
may I ask my learned friend

637
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,922
why she feels it necessary

638
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,374
to give details
of Ms. Hewitt's career

639
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,731
and what possible relevance
it can have in the case?

640
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,259
My lord, the circumstances
at Barfield Prison at that time

641
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:08,671
are very important
to the defense of Anthony Kelly.

642
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,504
You may continue,
Ms. Knatchbull.

643
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,703
Thank you, my lord.

644
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,269
Perhaps I should clarify
the reasoning

645
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,611
behind my line of questioning.

646
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,151
Anthony Kelly was placed at risk

647
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,584
the moment he was admitted
to Barfield,

648
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,020
as Ms. Hewitt is a new
and very young governor.

649
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,990
My Lord, Ms. Hewitt's
professional credibility

650
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,993
is not in question
at this trial.

651
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,937
I suggest my learned friend
should read the papers.

652
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,939
Since Ms. Hewitt took over
the running of Barfield,

653
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,488
two men escaped
in a helicopter...

654
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,624
My Lord.

655
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,368
Very well.
You may continue.

656
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,213
KNATCHBULL: Ms. Hewitt,
how long was Anthony Kelly held

657
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,546
at Barfield?

658
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,778
Almost two days.

659
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,579
Did you interview him?

660
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,385
No, I did not.

661
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,127
So you didn't actually know him
at all?

662
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,253
I knew his age,

663
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,492
plus information regarding
his crime and his sentence.

664
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,127
But you did not actually see him
on his admittance?

665
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,569
Until a prisoner
has been interviewed

666
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,937
by the probation department
and the medical staff,

667
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,738
until I have received a full
and detailed report

668
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,810
regarding his needs,

669
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,371
be they educational,
medical, or domestic...

670
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,211
How long does <i>that</i> take?

671
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,719
In Anthony Kelly's situation,
almost two days.

672
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,779
I would just like to point out,
in case you're not aware of it,

673
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,382
that each wing also has
its own governor

674
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,790
and its own senior officer.

675
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,625
I'm sorry, Ms. Hewitt,
but who put Anthony Kelly,

676
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,598
a young 24-year-old
first offender,

677
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,531
into a cell with two prisoners,

678
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,038
both serving long sentences
for violent crimes?

679
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,384
- Objection, my lord.
- I object.

680
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,603
My client's previous record has
no bearing on the present case.

681
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,873
Please rephrase the question,
Ms. Knatchbull.

682
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:04,280
Ms. Hewitt, is cell 29, D Wing,
designed for two occupants?

683
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,847
Yes.
That is correct.

684
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,258
How many occupants were
allocated to cell 29, D Wing,

685
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,853
the night Colin Foster hanged?

686
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,930
Three.

687
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,125
We have heard in court today

688
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,363
that it is against
Barfield Prison regulations

689
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,463
to allow men to associate
in their cells.

690
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,343
We have also heard that on
the night Colin Foster died,

691
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,810
four men were in the cell.

692
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,574
The deceased makes five.

693
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,708
My lord, I really cannot see why
my learned friend feels obliged

694
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,343
to repeat what has already
been proved without objection.

695
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,253
Please rephrase your question,
Ms. Knatchbull.

696
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,886
Ms. Hewitt, you stated
that no officer was to be blamed

697
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,864
for the tragic events.

698
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,965
Yet surely they were
sadly lacking

699
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:54,735
in their duty that evening
to allow five men in cell 29.

700
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,173
I'm sorry.
What exactly is your question?

701
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,302
Do you admit
that there was a negligence

702
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,155
on the part of the officers
on duty that night,

703
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,240
the night Colin Foster died?

704
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,582
I'm satisfied that there
was no negligence.

705
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,812
You are satisfied?

706

Anthony Kelly,

never been in prison before

708
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,240
and only arrived
the day before...

709
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,733
My lord, Ms. Knatchbull
is goading the witness.

710
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:26,332
Please make your questions
more direct, Ms. Knatchbull.

711
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,275
Why was Anthony Kelly placed
in cell 29, D Wing, Ms. Hewitt?

712
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,283
I had no alternative, no other
accommodation available.

713
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,185
May I ask, Ms. Hewitt,
if you <i>had</i> had an alternative,

714
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,156
would you still have delegated
Mr. Kelly to cell 29?

715
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,555
Not necessarily.

716
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,218
Not necessarily?

717
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,156
These three men
then forced Anthony Kelly

718
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,994
to take part
in a sickening trial,

719

accusing the deceased
of being a nonce... a nonce!

the expression.

Ms. Knatchbull.

Members of the jury, you will
please ignore the implication

724

that force was used
by any of the defendants.

725

May I ask you Ms. Hewitt,
from a humanitarian aspect,

726
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,997
do you believe any proportion
of blame can be attached

727
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,055
to Barfield Prison?

728

Ms. Knatchbull,
I take full responsibility

Thank you very much
for admitting responsibility.

Thank you, Ms. Hewitt.

He was sort of the main joker.

Yeah.
To a point.

Kelly put himself in that cell.

He did it when he committed

Colin, um, took some flex
out of his own pocket.

He said he wasn't a-a nonce

and he would prove it
by hanging himself.

that his co-defendants tried
