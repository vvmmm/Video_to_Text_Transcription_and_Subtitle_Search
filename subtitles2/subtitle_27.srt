You deserve to be here.</i>

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,805

you have to convince him you do.</i>

[sighs]

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,853
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,439
[chuckling] What? No. What? No!

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,733
Why would you... No. No, I-I'm here to...

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,319
[Sheila] <i>Run away from the husband
trying to lock you in the loony bin.</i>

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,573
Accept your generous offer
of the endorsement thing.

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,493
The "endorsement thing"?

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,912
You've given it a lot of thought, clearly.

11
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,207
[Sheila] <i>Sell it. Believe it.
It's the only way he will.</i>

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,127
I have actually, and I realized...

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,797
I mean, what an opportunity working with
and learning from you would be.

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,884
So, here I am. [chuckles]

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,804
Should we make it official?

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,436
- Let's tan.
- Excuse me?

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,647
My treat. Come on.

18
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,486
Hey, uh, I don't like the way
we left things the other day. I regret it.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,154
Oh, don't say another word.

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,990
I mean,
it was an intellectual disagreement,

21
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,494
and luckily we live in a country
where that can still happen.

22
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,454
- [chuckles]
- Water under the bridge.

23
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,414
- Let me pour you a glass.
- Great.

24
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:26,336
Uh, do you have those 990 series forms
and the EIN tax documents for E.Y.E.?

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,671
Um...

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,925
Yeah, some... somewhere. I don't
know... [stammers]...exactly where.

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,760
Would you go get them, please?

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,596
Is this some kind of a breakup?

29
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,683
No. [chuckles] Uh, no,
it is most definitely not a breakup.

30
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,811
Yeah, obviously
I didn't mean it like that. Jesus.

31
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,731
It's been decided that it would be best
if you and E.Y.E. parted ways.

32
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,274
I need those tax documents.

33
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,026
So, it's a coup?

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,154
Oh, come on, Danny.
It's not like you care about any of this.

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,324
I don't care? I don't care? I... [stammers]

36
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,494
Nothing hurts more
than someone saying that I...

37
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,997
All I do is care!
All I do is fucking care!

38
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,207
- About the ocean?
- Yes!

39
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,333
- The environment?
- Yes!

40
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,584
I don't think so.

41
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,754
The less you have to do with the group,
the better-off it's done.

42
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,882
Our donations are up threefold
ever since that good press we got.

43
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,385
You know, some people
just aren't cut out for leadership.

44
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,845
And your son, Leo, is?

45
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,972
Maybe. After a few years at least.

46
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,640
Oh, yeah, maybe, in a few years.

47
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,143
He has the charisma
of a pile of fucking laundry.

48
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:26,146
Have you heard him talk about
his crush at school, Stephanie K.?

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,273
[laughs] Come on, pal.

50
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,525
He's delusional.
And I'll tell you what, so are you!

51
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,693
Danny!

52
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,320
[Wanda inhales deeply]

53
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,534
Why don't you go get the tax forms
so I can get on with my day?

54
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,036
Okay.

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,540
[Vinnie sighs]

56
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,502
[Sheila] So, you still teach
some of your classes, right?

57
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,338
Even though you've expanded,
you still lead a lot of your classes?

58
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,550
More than I should.
So says Marika, at least.

59
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,302
Wh-why does she say that?

60
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,097
Well, to her, classes are
the ground level of the pyramid.

61
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,725
Oh. Well, I guess that makes sense.

62
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,602
Oh, she's a genius. [chuckles]

63
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,147
[Sheila] <i>Maybe she's gay too.
That's gotta be what this is.</i>

64
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,484
Yeah. Well, the thing about aerobics
that I love is the aerobics.

65
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,860
- [both chuckle]
- And I...

66
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,779
You know, I hardly get to do it anymore.

67
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,365
Oh, if she heard you say that,
she would tear you to shreds!

68
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,242
- Oh.
- "It's not a hobby. Grow up.

69
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,371
If we don't stop growing, we die.
Stop biting your fingernails."

70
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,124
I bite my fingernails,
and she hates that about me.

71
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,753
So, wh-what is the top of the pyramid?

72
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,130
I mean, really. [chuckles] Is there one?

73
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,217
Is that a philosophical question
or a business one?

74
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,885
[Sheila chuckles] Both.

75
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,263
When you get a big,
fat, juicy buyout offer.

76
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,599
I'm talking Nabisco big.

77
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,685
And then you just sell
the whole fucking pyramid

78
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,063
and move to the Bahamas. [chuckles]

79
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,400
But that's a ways away yet.

80

[chuckles] I-I guess I...
Oh, I'm-I'm not really sure.

84
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,748
Hmm.

Okay.

00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,466
- You're not?
- [scoffs] No.

89
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,301
I am ready for new.

90
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,137
Mexico's been around, Bun.

91
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,764
I meant new to us.

92
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,850
Just disappearing for a while, laying low.

93
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,186
That sounds pretty fucking cool
to me right now.

94
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,148
[sighs] I have to say goodbye to her.

95
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
[sighs]

96
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,069
My surf spot.

97
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,614
Waves are waves.
They got 'em down there too. Keep packing.

98
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,828
Fine. Fuck! We'll go by there
on our way out of town.

99
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,957
- You're the champ, Bun!
- [chuckles]

100
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,418
You know,
I'm taping a... a new infomercial today.

101
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,087
Tonight, actually.
Marika thinks it will help capture

102
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,550
the "night time is the right time" energy
of the thing.

103
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,468
What's the thing?

104
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,221
Well, I am the thing, always.

105
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,475
But the concept is a Vegas nightclub
on New Year's Eve.

106
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,518
"Counting Down to a New You."

107
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,146
Hmm. "New You's Eve."

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,523
- [Vinnie chuckles] Exactly!
- [chuckles]

109
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,360
But Marika wants an
"Ol' Blue Eyes in the Playboy Club" feel,

110
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,114
and... [scoffs]
I want it to be... something else.

111
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,576
Well, you're the thing, right?
So, just do it your way.

112
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,369
I mean, we do this every time.

113
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,122
We get in a fight before something big.
It's our tradition.

114
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:35,168
And it's stressful and it...
[sighs] ...wears on us both.

115
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,377
Yeah. But it's your process,

116
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,463
and you couldn't change it
even if you wanted to.

117
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,548
Exactly.

When I was about three or four...

153
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,717
I don't know how old. Was I three?

154
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,405
- I was just bodyboarding then, so...
- Mm-hmm. Can we do this faster?

155
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,097
Nope. I was three.

156
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,225
My cousin was the first one
to tell me I could piss in the ocean.

157
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,436
- Hmm.
- Right over there.

158
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,106
Aw, he was just like,
"Go in the ocean, dude."

159
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,191
I was like, "Cool."

160
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,151
I was about ankle-deep in.

161
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,113
I just pulled down my trunks
and started pissing.

162
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,198
It was glorious.

163
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,491
Sounds like it.

164
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,327
- [Tyler] Aw, but then...
- Baby, there is more to this story?

165
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,121
This crotchety old lady,

166
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,832
she grabbed me by the ear
and drags me back to my cousin,

167
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,960
and Joe is like,
"He's three years old. Now fuck off."

168
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,630
She got all offended and stomped off.

169
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,134
- People stomped off back then, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,219
Now...

171
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,724
Yep, that dude's drowning.

172
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,823
[shudders]

173
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,661
God. Hated that. But it had to happen.

174
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,583
What did he do that was so bad
that he deserved that?

175
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,420
Well, he did inferior work
on our product... my product.

176
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:10,216
And if I let people continue
to do that without consequences,

177
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,718
we're finished.

178
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,803
[scoffs]

179
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,513
What happened to you as a child?

180
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,516
[scoffs] Everything, obviously.

181
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,810
[both chuckle]

182
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,396
Do you wanna see how big my house is?

183
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,815
[Sheila] <i>Careful. You need a meal ticket,
not a new best friend.</i>

184
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,234
I do.

185
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,326
Here we are. [chuckles]

186
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,329
Where are my babies? Where are they?

187
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,582
Where are you? Where are you?
[kissing] Where are you?

188
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,336
Where are you? Here you are!
Yes, baby! Oh, yes! Kisses.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,631
Yes. Kisses, kisses. Good boy. Kisses.

190
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,175
Why is this?

191
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,594
- [Vinnie] Oh.
- We've met. Sheila Rubin.

192
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,765
I know. But why is this, Vincent?

193
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,267
Oh, hush. Come here. [speaks Spanish]

194
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,353
[Marika groans, scoffs]

195
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,566
We're talking about bringing Sheila
under the Vinnie Green banner.

196
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,569
Yes, we just had a great meeting
at the offices,

197
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,739
and Vinnie thought we should come
back here and continue the conversation.

198
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,701
- I'm in town just for a few more hours...
- Vincent and I will talk.

199
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,496
Sheila had her first tan
today at the office. [chuckles]

200
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,125
I mean, think about that. At her age,
first time in the tanning bed.

201
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,127
- [Marika] Mmm.
- Well, in San Diego,

202
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,254
we do tend to just rely on the sun.

203
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,882
Your skin is, um... [inhales deeply]

204
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,634
No. No.

205
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,805
Now, Vincent, we have
a frozen-food company from Cincinnati

206
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,348
- coming to the shoot tonight...
- Oh.

207
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,184
And then to have a big talk afterward.

208
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,103
- Oh. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

209
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,901
Do you have a Cincinnati, San Diego?

210
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,445
I don't know what you're asking me.

211
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,030
Perhaps you don't belong here?

212
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,158
That doesn't seem like a question.

213
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,201
Marika, you're being too playful.

214
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,120
She wants to help sell our hosiery.

215
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,373
- Well, I've seen the tape, and she won't.
- [chuckles]

216
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,458
Women don't like you.

217
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,587
[inhales sharply]
Your tuxedo came back from the tailors,

218
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,756
and, ooh, it is perfect.

219
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,633
[both chuckle]

220
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,011
Can we talk about my wardrobe for tonight?

221
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,850
I'm leaning towards something
a little more casual than the tuxedo.

222
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,227
You know, more me.

223
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,855
Come upstairs.

224
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,024
I want to hear how it went with Diem.

225
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,074
[both panting]

226
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,910
Just a little closer, dude.

227
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,663
[coughing]

228
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,082
- You all right?
- Yeah. [coughing]

229
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,502
[both panting]

230
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,338
- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- [Danny groans] Yeah. Yeah.

231
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,591
- [Danny groaning]
- [panting]

232
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,802
Oh, no fucking way!

233
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,137
- Right? It's this fucking guy.
- Oh...

234
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,056
I don't know what happened.

235
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,185
The current started to take me out.

236
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,561
What are the odds?

237
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,022
He was probably trying to kill himself
to get away from her.

238
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,733
[pants] Dude...

239
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,110
Wait, I know you.

240
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,028
You do, dude. I know.

241
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,447
Okay, great.
We've put two and two together.

242
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,907
- Now, Tyler...
- Tyler?

243
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,826
- I'm him, dude.
- And Bunny.

244
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,163
You just saved my fucking life.

245
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,333
Just like Elton said you would.

246
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,918
Oh, yeah, I'm not a huge fan,
but that's cool.

247
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,921
Uh-huh. We're leaving.

248
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,923
Wait! Wait!

249
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,508
Wait.

250
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,635
This is a sign.

251
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,388
Oh, no. It's not.

252
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,182
We were meant to be here
at this exact moment.

253
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,350
Don't say it.

254
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,185
This all happened for a reason.

255
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,729
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

256
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,149
Isn't there, like, some kind of,
uh, medieval code or something?

257
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,486
You gotta come over to my house
for wine and sweetmeats now?

258
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,906
- Sounds pretty chill.
- Wh-What... What is happening?

259
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,034
I make a pretty decent mole.

260
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,871
How did he know I love mole?

261
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,541
[Sheila] <i>You don't have to call him.</i>

262
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,253
<i>You're in rehab, so it's perfectly
acceptable to be out of touch.</i>

263
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,714
<i>You're healing. Growing.</i>

264
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:22,093
<i>Unless he calls them and finds out
you did a runner and never showed up.</i>

265
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>Just call him. Buy yourself some time
to see this Vinnie thing through.</i>

266
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,723
[sighs]

267
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,189
<i>Keep it simple.
Don't get yourself into any more trouble.</i>

268
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,738
[line ringing]

269
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,157
[Danny] <i>You've reached the Rubins.</i>

270
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,243
<i>Please leave us a message after the tone,
and we will call you back.</i>

271
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,745
[Maya, Danny] <i>Peace and love</i>.

272
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,121
[beeps]

273
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,832
Hi, Danny! Hi, Maya.

274
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,378
It's me. It's Sheila. Mama.

275
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,672
Um, I just...
I just wanted to call to check in

276
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:05,512
and let you know, uh, that I'm good.
It's been very, very good here.

277
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,223
Um, I'm already feeling much healthier

278
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:13,269
and learning so much about myself
and the path ahead.

279
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,315
So, um, thank you
for encouraging me to come here.

280
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:22,946
I really appreciate it.
And... [sighs] ...I love you both.

281
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,990
Uh, and, uh, I should let
someone else use the phone now,

282
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,036
but, um, I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye.

283
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,165
[Vinnie] Oh! You found the phone, I see.
Good. [chuckles]

284
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh, I hope that's okay.
I was just checking in with my family.

285
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,421
Oh, I understand as a father of two.

286
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,172
[both chuckle]

287
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,009
- Come on. I wanna show you my lair.
- Oh.

288
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,740
[Vinnie sighing]

289
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,535
[chuckles]
Can you even move in that thing?

290
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,620
Well, it...
It gives a little more than it did,

291
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,914
but I still feel like
I'm in a straitjacket.

292
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,459
Well, you have to be comfortable
to be confident.

293
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,837
- I'm stealing that.
- [both chuckle]

294
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,382
- Go tell her.
- It's still rest period.

295
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,719
[breathes deeply, grunts]

296
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,846
And she t... she takes her rest period
somewhere else?

297
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,598
Oh, she sleeps upstairs in the master.

298
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,849
[softly] Oh.

299
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,976
I run hot body-temp-wise.

300
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,103
It's the one thing
that we're not in sync on.

301
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,606
But here, it's nice and cool
because of the concrete.

302
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,649
Plus... [sighs] ...there's my train set.

303
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,527
- [train whistle blows]
- [sighs]

304
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:49,449
I've had it my whole life, and the sound,
it just... it-it soothes me.

305
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,871
And this was your decision?
Living in the garage?

306
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,040
Well, of course, it was.
It's my house. [chuckles]

307
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,669
I like it this way.
You know, it works for both of us.

308
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,715
Do you really like it?
Or are you just used to it?

309
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,885
We all adapt to our circumstances,
don't we?

310
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,847
Like you and your husband.
You had a good chat before?

311
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,015
[Sheila] <i>Watch it.</i>

312
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,935
<i>You're here to learn his secrets,
not the other way around.</i>

313
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:21,023
I just left a message. He worries.

314
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,358
Then it's good that you checked in.

315
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,987
[sighs]

316
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,199
Ugh.

317
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,992
You want me to show you
the outfit I like for the shoot?

318
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,079
- [humming]
- ["Say What's On Your Mind" playing]

319
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,500
Sorry I sort of, uh,
overpromised on the... the mole.

320
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,503
I think I meant guacamole. I don't...
I don't know how to make mole.

321
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,879
It's all good, dude.

322
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,175
So, Queen Sheila's off at some spa
for the weekend?

323
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,137
Is she paying them,
or are they paying her? [chuckles]

324
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,389
Uh, no. We're paying.

325
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,768
But she just, you know,
needed a little break.

326
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,937
You sure I can't get you a glass for that?

327
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,981
Fucking told you I'm good with the bottle.

328
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,525
[Tyler] Babe, please?

329
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,780
So, uh, Mexico?

330
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,366
How'd that idea come together?

331
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,038
Tyler's always wanted to learn
how to make homemade tortillas.

332
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,498
That's true.

333
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,666
Huh.

334
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,294
So, like, sort of
a small business venture?

335
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,130
I don't know. You know,

336
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,799
just seems like they probably
have a head start on you down there

337
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,636
when it comes to market share
and expertise.

338
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,556
This might be a good time to admit,

339
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,351
we haven't thought the Mexico plan fully,
super through.

340
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,520
So, why are you guys really going?

341
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,022
Why is your wife really out of town?

342
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,399
Okay.

343
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,568
I got it.

344
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,029
Who am I to tell you guys
how to live your lives?

345
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,573
- Nobody.
- [Tyler] Nobody's nobody.

346
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,784
Everybody's somebody.

347
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:59,872
Yes. That right there is the truth.

348
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,499
Wait, is that the truth?

349
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,543
No, now that I think about it,
I don't think that's the truth at all

350
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,671
because there's a lot of nobodies
out there just walking amongst us,

351
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,258
and a lot of those nobodies
think they are somebodies.

352
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,095
Is this what
a nervous breakdown looks like?

353
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,973
Could I share something with you guys
that I've never shared before?

354
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,645
[Vinnie] Marika may seem overbearing
to you, I know. [sighs]

355
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,982
A lot of people don't understand it,
and I-I don't blame them.

356
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,776
I understand it completely.

357
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,989
I've had some experience
with a Marika-type in my life.

358
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,158
You know, someone
with a real hold over me.

359
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,036
- [Vinnie] What, your husband?
- No. [chuckles]

360
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:44,958
It's someone else.
Someone I've just gotten very used to.

361
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,295
That I always thought I needed,
but, uh, I'm beginning to think...

362
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,132
[Sheila] <i>What are you doing?
This is not helpful or necessary.</i>

363
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,968
[sighs] ...that she's, uh, holding me back.

364
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,637
<i>How is sharing this helping you?
Shut your trap.</i>

365
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,600
She just needs me to need her.
She's a parasite.

366
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,146
She tells me she's helping me,
but really, she's draining me.

367
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,107
[Vinnie] Wait, your mother?
Your manager? Who is this person?

368
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,461
[Sheila] <i>What are you gonna say?
She's a voice in your head?</i>

369
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,195
<i>He'll think you're crazy,
and he's an adult with a train set.</i>

370
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,491
She's an old friend,
someone who's been with me for a while.

371
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,202
- [gasps, scoffs]
- Do you love it? Because I do. I love it.

372
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,414
- It's incredible.
- It is, isn't it? [laughs]

373
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,626
- Do you want a pep pill?
- Yeah.

374
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,003
Mmm.

375
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,630
I get them from a valet parking attendant
at the Bistro Gardens,

376
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,966
and Marika doesn't know about it.
[inhales sharply]

377
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,135
We have to keep a few little secrets,
don't we?

378
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,972
[grunts]

379
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,932
Being in the studio is always nice,

380
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:47,145
but here is where the real
creative magic happens.

381
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,772
[both chuckle]

382
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,567
But there's a little game
that I like to play first.

383
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:58,073
You have the chance to even the score
right now in the lightning round.

384
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,867
Rapid fire. [whooshes]

385
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,078
Don't think. Just answer.

386
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,873
No skipping. No lying.
Don't fuck with me, or you're out.

387
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,084
- You ready?
- Yes. [chuckles]

388
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,669
Go. Who were you lying to
on the telephone?

389
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,173
- Oh, I-I told you. I wasn't lying...
- Who exactly?

390
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,841
- My husband.
- [Vinnie] And?

391
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,926
My child.

392
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,810
Where do your husband
and child think you are?

393
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,597
- Spa.
- Fuck you, Sheila.

394
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,140
- A mental health facility.
- For what?

395
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,475
For bulimia.

396
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,852
Is that the throwing-up one?

397
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,122
- Verbal answers only, please.
- Yes.

398
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,855
- Does it work?
- Yes, until it doesn't.

399
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,774
Your Marika-type, who is it?

400
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,734
- It's me.
- No cheating. [exclaims]

401
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,821
It-It's me, but it's not me.
It's just a voice inside my head.

402
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,989
- Whoa, sounds crazy.
- Yes, it is.

403
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,199
And she controls you?

404
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,076
Well, it feels that way, yes.

405
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,327
And do you hate her?

406
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,915
Intensely, but I am her too. [pants]

407
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,793
Who messed with you when you were a kid?
[breathes shakily]

408
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,128
Friend of my father's.

409
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:56,297
[breathes shakily, groans]

410
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,676
- Me too! [exclaims]
- [squeals, chuckles]

411
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,511
- [upbeat music playing]
- Ding, ding, ding, ding!

412
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,430
- She did it!
- Whoo! [chuckles]

413
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,348
Johnny, tell her what she's won!

414
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,393
She gets a chance to dance with Vinnie.

415
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,270
- Ha, fucking, ha!
- Ha!

416
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,938
Green!

417
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,483
[both whooping]

418
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,402
[both laughing]

419
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,238
[whooping continues]

420
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,370
- Ha!
- [both whooping]

421
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,124
Ha! Ha!

422
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,254
Ha! Yes!

423
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,506
Ha! Ha!

424
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,259
[laughs] Ha!

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,557
Ha! Ha! Whoo! Ha!

426
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,852
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

427
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,815
[Vinnie] Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

428
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,571
[both whooping]

429
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,576
- Your turn.
- Oh, no. That's not how this works.

430
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,454
- Fuck you, Vinnie.
- [laughs]

431
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,249
What's the arrangement
with you and Marika?

432
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,502
We share our home and our lives.
Full stop.

433
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,921
[chuckles] Does she know you're gay?

434
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,508
Oh, everyone knows
how blissfully happy I am. [pants]

435
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:22,926
You know what I mean.

436
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,512
Well, we understand
and support each other.

437
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:28,264
I had a six-month affair
with a Mormon man I despise.

438
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,142
- Ah. [panting]
- Even though it's over, I just miss it.

439
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,311
I miss being that awful to myself.

440
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,022
- Well, at least you ended it, right?
- No. He did.

441
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,109
I don't stop anything myself.
That's what the voice is for.

442
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,111
Oh, is that what the voice is for?

443
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,324
That's what it wants you to think.

444
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,619
But you can do anything
you set your mind to.

445
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,830
[pants] You really believe that?

446
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,040
I make people believe it.

447
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,793
And that's even better
than believing it myself.

448
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,004
Whoo-hoo!

449
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:04,843
So without anyone asking
or even suggesting that I should,

450
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:09,722
ever since I was 16,
I have been writing my life story.

451
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,099
In my own words.

452
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,352
And I continue to write it... [sighs]

453
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:18,648
even as my life has become
less and less notable.

454
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,900
Are you gonna read some of it to us?

455
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,945
Damn right he is. Pick a page.

456
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,490
Yea-Yeah, I w... I will. Yeah.

457
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,001
Okay. [sighs]

458
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:42,005
Yeah. [swallows] Hmm.

459
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,843
[sighs] No one's ever heard this before.

460
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,803
[sniffs]

461
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:51,347
"And then, there I was, alone,

462
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,933
with nothing but a flashlight,
my thoughts,

463
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,855
and a bottle of Hemingway
to wash it all down."

464
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,566
Actually, this is more painful
than I thought it would be.

465
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,068
Keep going.

466
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:10,241
"I found out early
that a good book is a warm blanket"...

467
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,660
Jesus Christ. [sighs]

468
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:16,581
"But reality is a chilly place,
and politics is a cold bitch"...

469
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,208
That's unnecessary.

470
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:23,630
"One that tears away our illusion
of safety and forces us to face the...

471
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,551
dragon of life."

472
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,512
I don't think I can continue.

473
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,014
You can and you will.

474
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,395
[breathes deeply]

475
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,689
[knocking]

476
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,941
[sighs] That's her.

477
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,611
Don't worry. Just stay focused.
You got this.

478
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,780
Oh. [chuckles]

479
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:53,034
Okay. You've had your fun.
Now put on the correct clothes.

480
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,452
These are the correct clothes.

481
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,704
- Shut up, you.
- That's not very kind.

482
00:24:56,705 --> 00:25:00,167
Don't fucking talk to me like that.
I'm not scared of you.

483
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,836
You're not smart enough to be.

484
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:08,049
- She's not your fucking mother.
- And she is very much not your friend.

485
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,843
You know nothing about her.

486
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:13,263
She is another imitator. Another parasite.

487
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,723
She listened to me!

488
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,478
All day. To my ideas.

489
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,855
When's the last time you listened to me

490
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,024
instead of bullying me
into listening to you?

491
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:29,404
Well... [chuckles] ...I
guess that's it then.

492
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,032
Enjoy your shoot.

493
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,413
[sighs]

494
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,792
- [chuckles]
- Oh, okay.

495
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:47,673
"My 24th year on this blue marble
would prove to be my boldest.

496
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:52,970
But that night, I took one more sip
of Ernesto, and off I went.

497
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,222
To discover, to grow,

498
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,853
to pick the fights that needed fighting,
and to win."

499
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,774
- [sighs]
- That sucked.

500
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,359
You sucked.

501
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,408
Yes, I did. And I do. [sighs]

502
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,285
And despite all my amateurish predictions,

503
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:22,082
I neither... [sighs]
started any fights nor won any.

504
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,255
Is it any wonder she cheated on me?

505
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:36,179
So, y... you're, like, cool with her?

506
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,142
Well, I wouldn't say "cool,"
but I understand it.

507
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,270
- [Bunny] We all do.
- Big of you, man,

508
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:47,232
considering who she got it on with,
which is like your archenemy.

509
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,693
Wait, what... what was that now?

510
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,781
[audience chattering]

511
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,828
[announcer] Places, everyone.
Places for the top of the show.

512
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,376
[breathing shakily]

513
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,338
Just go get her, Sheila, please.
Just tell her I'm sorry.

514
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,590
[stammers]

515
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:15,677
Vinnie. Vinnie, you're fine. [chuckles]

516
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,804
You've done this so many times before.

517
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,849
Just go out there and... and be you.
Just be you.

518
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,645
Shut the fuck up! Just find her, please!

519
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,607
[crying] I... I need her.

520
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,363
Please. Please, Sheila.

521
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,491
[whimpering]

522
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,041
[crying continues]

523
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,671
[Sheila] <i>You silly fool.</i>

524
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,467
<i>I told you not to get sucked in,
but you wouldn't listen.</i>

525
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,386
<i>You never listen.</i>

526
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,429
<i>You thought you could fix him,</i>

527
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,723
<i>and then all your problems
would disappear?</i>

528
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,058
<i>That I would disappear?</i>

529
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,396
<i>But I'm not going anywhere.</i>

530
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:11,900
<i>You can't fire me.
You can't tune me out. You need me.</i>

531
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,111
Shut up! Shut the fuck up. Please.

532
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:17,697
- <i>You'll rot without me.</i>
- I said stop it!

533
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,968
- [pleading continues]
- <i>You'll turn into an old, lazy, fat fuck</i>

534
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,993
<i>with nothing to show for yourself.
Nothing to live for.</i>

535
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:26,623
- <i>No reason to be alive on this planet.</i>
- Get out! Get out of here! Get out!

536
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:29,543
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- No! No!

537
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,045
I'm not okay! I'm not okay.

538
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,965
[sobbing] I just... It's...
None of this is working anymore.

539
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,595
I just need some help. [sobs]

540
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,223
[door opens, closes]

541
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,225
[footsteps approaching]

542
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,309
May I help you?

543
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,521
Yeah, I'm, uh, Danny Rubin,
here to see my wife, Sheila.

544
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:53,066
- Rubin?
- Mm-hmm, yeah. Uh, Sheila Rubin.

545
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,236
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not aware
of any patient by that name.
