"The secret bandish if you sing
from the heart

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
You shall pacify Shiva's "tandav".

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,360
The beats of 'dadra'
Shall nullify the poison.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,440
Then Raga Sanjivani you shall find".

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,880
Lord Shiva took the poison in his throat
during the "Churning of the Oceans".

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,560
His throat turned blue from the poison
and he was named "Neelkantha".

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,480
Hey, know-it-all, stop your lectures.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,960
Where's Raga Sanjivani?

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
Have patience, Maestro Sasikanta.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,560
Shruti, give me your phone.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,200
I think the "bandish" which appeared
on the ceiling...

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
were composed by Amanat Khan.

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,560
And if it is sung flawlessly
in the six-beat rhythm...

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,840
the bluish glow on the throat of the idol
will wipe off and a magic will happen.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,240
And you have to sing it
in a particular raga.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,440
Which raga?

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,560
"This secret bandish if you sing
From your heart

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,120
You shall pacify Shiva's 'tandava' ".

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,920
According to myth, Shiva started
the 'tandav' dance when "sati" died.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,240
Goddess Saraswati created a particular raga
in order to pacify him.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,320
Raga Malkauns!

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,360
Malkauns.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,760
I've understood everything.
It only needs to be sung.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,520
So... Naad alone is enough for it.

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,840
Naad, sing the bandish
in Raga Malkauns.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,440
After we get the Raga Sanjivani
we'll kill them...

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,320
and bury them on the banks
of River Domor.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
Start singing.

Along with it burns a thousand flames

that you've misled us for ages.

93
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,640
You did not let us live or love.

94
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,920
You confined us here
because you didn't want us to go out.

95
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,879
You've denied the natural phenomenon

You've manipulated them

What nonsense!

98
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Why would I do it?

99
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm telling the reason.

100
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,960
Because you...

101
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,840
never wanted us to surpass your music.

102
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,959
That's the reason!

103
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,920
- It's a lie.
- Yes.

104
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
You're lying.

105
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,760
The curse of the rudrabina is true.

106
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,920
We can't escape the curse if we disobey it.

107
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,240
If that's the case, Mr. Shashikanta...

108
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,520
then why does the mystery
of Raga Sanjivani...

109
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,560
have its solution in the music
of the Domors?

110
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
You...

111
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
who were the Rudrabhairavs, failed.

112

Why so?

113
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,320
The truth is that they have used god
to create a caste division.

114
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,520
But it has no value to God.

115
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
And you...

116
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
You know everything.

117
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,640
Don't you have another reason
to kill us, Mr. Shashikanta?

118
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,240
You're using the curse of the rudrabina
as an excuse for it.

119
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,080
- Isn't it?
- It's a lie.

120
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
He's lying.

121
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,440
Fine.

122
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,480
Your esteemed Rudrapur School of Music...

123
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,240
lost time and again to your former slave
Kedar Mishra's Anandagarh School of Music.

124
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
How can you accept this humiliation?

125
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,760
So you used the curse of the rudrabina...

126
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,240
to kill the musicians of Anandagarh School
instigating the Domors.

127
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Isn't it?

128
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,640
What are you waiting for?

129
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
- Burry them alive!
- Yes!

130
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Skin them alive.

131
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Hail.

132
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
What's this?

133
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
Nobody will come.

134
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,320
They've understood your trick, Master.

135
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,320
You consider this laddie to be your god?

136
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,920
Ask him...

137
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,800
if he can bring water in the River Domor
by singing Raga Sanjivani.

138
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,640
Then we'll see if he's really a god.

139
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,080
Can he do it?

140
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,520
Then ask him to prove himself.

141
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,120
Always remember one thing...

142
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,560
Music is not magic.

143
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,120
It's a practice.

144
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,720
It can awaken the different parts
of your body.

145
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,120
The great masters used music...

146
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,960
to connect with the divine...

147
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,440
Strange incidents took place
during such times.

148
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
Not everyone can do it.

149

150
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840

do it, Mom?

Yes, you can.
