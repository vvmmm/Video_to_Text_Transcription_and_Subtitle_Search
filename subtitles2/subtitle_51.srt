ï»¿1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,165
Hey! You!

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:06,298
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,517
What's all this for?

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,703
We was done last week.
Why us again?

5
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,540
Quit moaning, Harry.

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,137
You. Out.

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,146
Move!

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,308
Sorry, Mr. Jackson.
Just saying hello.

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,512
Right, that's it.
Get this lot packed up.

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,145
Get sorted.

11
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,985
What have you
got with you, then?

12
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,217
Any money?
Phone cards?

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,317
Have you got stuff
you can trade, have you?

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,520
Bastards.

15
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,586
Right, Brinkley, shut it.

16

Watch any video online with Open-SUBTITLES
Free Browser extension: osdb.link/ext

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,604
I want my visiting order!

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,043
Will have contacts for 14 hour
per day out of cell periods!

19
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,247
Let him go.
Let him out.

20
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,784
I'll pluck his eyes out!

21
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,862
You know what this is about,
don't you?

22
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,185
Look, I ain't no ruddy nonce.

23
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,190
Let's prove it.

24
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,953
We'll hold a kangaroo court
right here.

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,722
Harry, you can be judge.

26
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,955
You... defense counsel.

27
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,966
And you... What's your name?

28
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,661
Kelly.
Anthony.

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,862
Right, Anthony.
You're his solicitor.

30
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,064
What are you, Victor?

31
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,004
Oh.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,541
Oh, I'm the hangman.

33
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,368
No!

34
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,474
Over the top.

35
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,811
There.
There you go, nonce.

36
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,350
There.
Now.

37
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,746
You've had confirmation that the
trial will begin on Wednesday?

38
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,416
Yes.

39
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,825
All four of the prisoners have
their own legal representative,

40
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,956
and three of them have been
awarded legal aid.

41
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,933
However, prisoner
Anthony Kelly's family

42
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,163
have hired the services of...

43
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,670
Christina Knatchbull.

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,303
She's a pretty formidable
criminal barrister.

45
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,578
Very well known for her
manipulation of the media,

46
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,812
specifically the press.

47
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,186
Our main concern is with regard
to the prisoner Anthony Kelly.

48
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:07,752
Was it your decision to place
Kelly with, um, Foster

49
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,990
and Reynolds?

50
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,493
You never thought it might
be preferable to put this young

51
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,937
and first-time offender
into a cell by himself?

52
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,770
No, I did not.

53
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,006
In the past,
I have invariably discovered

54
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,211
that it's better for
a first-time offender to bunk up

55
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,379
with someone who can show them
the ropes.

56
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,549
Well, he was most certainly
shown them.

57
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,220
Colin Foster was tried
and hanged in his bloody cell.

58
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,701
Are you okay to drive?

59
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,398
I'm fine to drive, but don't for
a second think that I'm okay.

60
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,907
I didn't hear you coming
to my defense.

61
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,782
I didn't hear you admit

62
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,842
that we had discussed which cell
to put Anthony Kelly in.

63
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,830
And the area manager kept
bloody quiet, didn't he?

64
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,599
He knew all about it.
And what about Andrews?

65
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,649
He was on the wing
10 minutes before the hanging.

66
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,853
I bet he's not coming to court.

67
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,861
You were on duty that night.

68
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,264
How come it's all
my responsibility?

69
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,666
'Cause you're the governor.

70
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,467
Tray collection!
Stand at your pad door!

71
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,337
Slop out!

72
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,852
Slop out.

73
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,099
Can you hurry it up, please?

74
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,650
They're bringing
the food trolleys up.

75
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,901
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

76
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,314
This is a two-man cell, correct?

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,790
Yes.

78
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,589
So when three men
were in this cell,

79
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,855
where was the third bunk,

80
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,988
and which one was allocated
to Anthony Kelly?

81
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:32,865
It was anchored to this one
and raised up as a bunk bed.

82
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,789
The body was found
hanging from the air vent.

83
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,844
Yes.

84
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,388
Chair fallen to one side.

85
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,391
Yes.

86
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,791
The four prisoners involved
are in the segregation unit

87
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,920
and have been since the hanging.

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,969
- Anthony, you okay?
- No talking, Braithwaite.

89
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,596
- All right, son.
- Get back from your door.

90
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,732
Anthony?

91
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,207
Slop out.

92
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,779
Step out.
Visitor.

93
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,282
All right, Mr. Kelly.
Let's go.

94
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,442
Anthony?

95
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,180
Pay no mind, Anthony!

96
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,154
- Shut it, Victor!
- Oi! Kelly!

97
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,748
- No talking!
- Kelly! Kelly, can you hear me?

98
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,120
I have never,
ever had to interview a client

99
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,562
preparing for trial
in this manner.

100
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,293
I would like my objection
to be placed on record.

101
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,495
I'm sorry, Ms. Knatchbull,
but it's the governor's orders.

102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,337
All the other counsel
have been required to do so.

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,947
Are you all right, Anthony?

104
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,812
I'm sorry they put us in here

105
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,484
for our last conference
before the trial.

106
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,077
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

107
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,282
The next time I see you
will be in court.

108
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,416
But I won't waste time
on that now.

109
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,187
Will my girlfriend, Sandra,
be there?

110
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,554
Only if she's been called
as a witness.

111
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,694
Because all the defendants
are currently serving sentences

112
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,998
the trial will be held
in camera.

113
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,781
I believe you are innocent.

114
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,212
Look at me, Anthony.

115
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,987
You understand the charges?

116
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,362
You played no part
in the murder of Colin Foster.

117
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,453
I didn't.

118
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,193
I didn't.
I swear before God I didn't.

119
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,661
I'm so scared.

120
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,285
Oi, love.

121
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,413
Oi, love.
No staff vehicles.

122
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,958
I'm the governor!

123
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,527
You got a 12:00 with a POA,

124
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,732
then one at 11:00 with, uh,
the HMS.

125
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,866
And these are the lists
of interviews.

126
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,639
Now, I've spaced them
15 minutes each.

127
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,711
And the applicants
from the educational department,

128
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,375
they're in that file,
so I've listed them as well.

129
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,849
We've got a full afternoon.

130
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,476
When do I not have one, Mavis?

131
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,272
You also wanted to start
checking the meals,

132
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,831
at the main kitchen's
almost functional.

133
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,154
- I can pull that back.
- No. No.

134
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,752
I've had a lot of complaints
about boiled potatoes.

135
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,763
Boiled potatoes
and more boiled potatoes.

136
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,991
Right.

137
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,863
Right, Mavis.
Start them coming in.

138
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,074
Are these in the right order?

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,203
Mavis?

140
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,440
Mr. Udding, Governor.

141
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,311
Come in.
Please sit down.

142
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,248
Thank you.

143
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,650
Sorry. I was, uh,
very late this morning.

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,416
That's, uh, that's all right.

145
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,480
I suppose with all
the construction going on,

146
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,150
you've had your hands full.

147
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,956
Yes.

148
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,862
It's, uh, double security
and checking every man

149
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,095
and moving all the inmates
we have here around

150
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,760
as the work progresses.

151
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,998
And it <i>is</i> progressing.

152
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,530
Right...

153
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,442
John.

154
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,653
This is very impressive.

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,922
Do you want to tell me why
you're leaving your present job?

156
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,188
The governor and I
do not see eye to eye.

157
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,558
He seems to think
that because I am black,

158
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,156
I should be concentrating
on black prisoners,

159
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,826
whereas I feel whatever I am

160
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,338
should in no way differentiate
me from the other officers.

161
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,139
How do they... uh,
the inmates... react to you?

162
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,908
Once they see the brother act
doesn't work,

163
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,916
they're probably
more antagonistic towards me

164
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,145
than they are
with the other officers.

165
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,313
But I...

166
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,549
I reckon you've just got to
give it time.

167
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,149
There's no need to go in
heavy-handed.

168
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,886
About the other officers.

169
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,826
How do they react?

170
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,824
Pretty much the same
as the inmates.

171
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,432
Sorry.

172
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,238
I will. Thank you.

173
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,676
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

174
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,785
I'll walk you through
to the gate guard, Mr. Udding.

175
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,179
It's this way.

176
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,985
Shall I bring in the next, Gov?

177
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,612
Yes. I would say
that was the intention.

178
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,491
I'm sorry about, uh,
commandeering your office.

179
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,992
Shouldn't be too inconvenient.

180
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,528
Um, Anthony Kelly's counsel
has complained

181
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,258
about having to interview him
in a no-contact section.

182
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,357
Yes. I received
her terse little memo.

183
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,198
Next.
Mavis, next.

184
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,464
Mavis, who was the black bloke?

185
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,804
They all are.
Well, so far.

186
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,434
What, black?

187
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,570
The Governor, Ms. Hewitt.

188
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,512
Good morning. Please sit down.

189
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,743
It's Zania, isn't it?

190
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,816
Yes, it is.

191
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,219
I'm sorry.
I'm running a bit late.

192
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,415
So excuse me if I just get
straight to the point.

193
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,490
Okay.

194
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,294
Sorry.
Excuse me.

195
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,162
Governor.

196
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,474
Trolley's going down
on the wing.

197
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,229
No. Could you just hold
the trolley for two minutes?

198
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,163
Vegetable soup,
bread rolls as starter,

199
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,900
steak and kidney pie,
boiled potatoes,

200
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,373
peas and green beans,
main course,

201
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,773
jam roly-poly, pudding.

202
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,901
Could I have a plate?

203
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,572
I've had a few complaints that
the food served isn't very hot.

204
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,911
And, um, how many times
have you served boiled potatoes

205
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,359
since...
Well, since I've been here?

206
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,375
It's not my fault.
It's 'cause of the rebuilding.

207
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,353
It's got to go through
three corridors, outside,

208
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,048
then onto the wings.

209
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,485
The vegetables
are a bit overcooked,

210
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,392
and the boiled potatoes could do
with a few more minutes.

211
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,725
Is there custard served
with this?

212
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,198
Not today.
Milk was late arriving.

213
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,995
Where are the specials...
The diets and the allergy trays?

214
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,004
With the work going on,

215
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,007
I haven't got the space
to prepare the specials.

216
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,134
I do the medical ones,
but the diets,

217
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,473
they can just eat less.

218
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,494
You were in the army
weren't you?

219
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,541
Yes, ma'am.
Fifteen years.

220
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,711
I thought so.
Thank you.

221
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,277
Governor.

222
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,585
I've segregated him
in the cubicle.

223
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,956
I think you'd better come
and see him.

224
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:43,430
Is the doc... arranging
a visiting order for me?

225
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,268
- Morning.
- Morning.

226
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,185
How is he?

227
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,584
Not good.
His breathing is very erratic.

228
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,885
It's liver failure.

229
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,483
Recommendation 10 from Judge...

230
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,152
- Governor?
- In a second.

231
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,457
Is he dying?

232
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,553
Yes, he is.

233
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,859
Doc, are you gonna see him?

234
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,923
I've got to get back
on the wing.

235
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,463
I think he should wear
a surgical mask.

236
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,562
He's had severe nosebleeds.

237
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,574
I have asked to re-examine
prisoner Norman Jones.

238
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,939
I'll be right with you.

239
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,205
Into line
with the private-sector jails...

240
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,940
So, this one's trouble, huh?

241
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,676
You can say that again.

242
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,893
I've been in contact
with the medics

243
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,165
at two of Jones'
previous prisons.

244
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,436
Apparently without medication,
he becomes excessively violent.

245
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,573
How are you doing, Arnie?

246
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,555
What do you want?
Huh?

247
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,918
What is it?

248
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,483
Hold me hand, son.

249
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,931
Help me get through this.

250
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,233
Just let go, Arnie.

251
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,206
Everything's gonna be just fine.

252
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,602
That's a good lad.

253
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,478
Is this all there is to it, Doc?

254
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,720
Should be accorded

255
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,696
automatic access
to the same quality of life

256
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,562
as those detained
in psychiatric hospitals!

257
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,896
Shut up!

258
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,330
Now, shut up!

259
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,768
There is a man dying in there.

260
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,240
Thank you.

261
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,984
He's dead.

262
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,797
You know, when the, um,
when the prison's full up,

263
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,047
for want of a better
description,

264
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,835
we'll be needing
a full-time doctor.

265
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,336
Not my idea of heaven.
Sorry.

266
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,378
I knew the previous doctor.

267
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,791
That's why I stepped in
after the riot.

268
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,684
But as full time, no way.

269
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:53,316
Some of your inmates,
Ms. Hewitt, they, um, scare me.

270
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,794
And some of them repel me.

271
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,126
There's just so little kindness
in here,

272
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,361
and not everybody is able to
deal with the dregs of humanity.

273
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,228
They're not all dregs, Doctor.

274
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,102
Perhaps you have a vocation.

275
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,445
Maybe I have.

276
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,153
All I can do is repeat
what I was told.

277
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,716
The education department
should be ready next week.

278
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,593
Mr. Morgan?

279
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,573
I don't suppose you have
any news for me, have you?

280
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,690
What about?

281
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,734
My probation officer.

282
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,212
Before the riot, he said I was
on the list for a weekend visit.

283
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,499
I don't know, Fisher.

284
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,716
Best thing is to ask the
governor on her rounds tomorrow.

285
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I just work here, mate.

286
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,208
Hey, Jumbo!

287
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,505
Let's get on it.

288
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,341
Waste of time, mate.

289
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,472
Doc reckons he's got
a screw loose.

290
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,143
Mr. Morgan?

291
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,277
Did you find out about me query?

292
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,652
Brian, you have been asking the
same question for months now.

293
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,658
If you get 21 days added
to your original sentence,

294
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,694
it stands to reason
the days will be attached

295
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,694
to your release date.

296
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,731
Now, I told you that.
The gov told you that.

297
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,322
Half the wing has told you that.

298
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,458
Piss off.
Go on.

299
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,502
But I got some off
for good behavior.

300
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:14,098
Tell you who you should ask.
Norman, bloke in cell 48.

301
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,937
He'll put you straight, Brian.

302
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,943
Real friendly.
Go on. Ask him.

303
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,411
Nice one, Walter.
Thanks.

304
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,543
All right, mate.

305
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,106
Walter sent me over.

306
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,049
Said you'd help me with me EDI.

307
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,916
I don't know what to do.

308
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,652
What would you do?

309
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,191
They s-said a weekend, Walter.

310
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,596
Due for a weekend.
You know, start adjusting.

311
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,328
When was the last time
you was out?

312
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,996
Fifteenth of May 1981.

313
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,071
Christ.

314
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,052
You'll need more
than a weekend to adjust, mate.

315
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,511
There's been a lot of changes
since '81.

316
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,444
All right?
Explain it to you, did he?

317
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,848
You want to know what he said?

318
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,408
He said if I spoke to him again

319
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,215
he'd bite the tongue
out of me head.

320
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,017
Nice one, Walter.

321
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,524
Ms. Hewitt?

322
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,653
Malcolm Smith.

323
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,891
Thank you for coming in.
It's about Alan Fisher.

324
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,092
I am attempting to get
all the records,

325
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,226
but it's a long process.

326
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,771
You know, the entire department
went up in smoke.

327
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,897
But according to his file,

328
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,237
he was put forward
for a weekend visit.

329
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,903
He's got a parole date
in 18 months...

330
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,843
Well, seven now.

331
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,438
It was suggested
he be transferred

332
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,948
to an open prison near his home.

333
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,279
This is appalling.

334
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,751
Well, the new Home Office ruling
regarding home leave

335
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,118
is making
a lot of extra paperwork.

336
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,157
We have got to get
this department organized...

337
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,487
And fast.

338
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,822
I'll look into it.

339
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,126
Thank you very much for this.

340
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,564
Yes?

341
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,691
Call on line 2. It's Mr. Soames.

342
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,565
Is it all right if I go out
for lunch now?

343
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,263
Yes.
Thank you, Moira.

344
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,568
I'll contact you as soon
as I've checked through this.

345
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,711
Helen Hewitt, Mr. Soames.

346
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,909
I'm sorry.
I meant to return your call.

347
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,686
Yes. Yes.
Well, I can appreciate that.

348
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,723
But you must understand that
I was not on duty that night.

349
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,622
In fact,
on the night that it happened,

350
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,320
I was having dinner
with Mr. Andrews

351
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,692
and my area manager, John Bunny.

352
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,663
I suppose after the riot
at Barfield,

353
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,530
the prison must be
in a very disorganized state.

354
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,662
Not that disorganized,
Mr. Soames.

355
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,330
Good.

356
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,169
I was hoping you'd say that.

357
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,435
I'm very confident that the case
will be conclusive

358
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,312
and things will be dealt with
in as short a time as possible.

359
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,113
That said, there is one area
that troubles me.

360
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,984
The defendant, Anthony Kelly,
like all four men is pleading...

361
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,285
Not guilty. Yes.
Yeah.

362
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,689
Have you met Ms. Knatchbull?

363
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,885
No.

364
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,588
But she's obviously had
a lot of visits with Kelly

365
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,655
over the past six months,
and she's seen the cell.

366
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,724
Why did you ask if I'd met her?

367
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,438
Ms. Knatchbull's worried
that her client can be... got at.

368
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,803
I'm sorry?

369
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,236
Well, it's obviously
not meant to sound

370
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,211
as if I'm undermining
Barfield's security.

371
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,747
The men involved in the hanging
have all been segregated

372
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,751
for the past six months
and remain in secure cells.

373
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,310
Am I right in assuming
that during cell association

374
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:18,085
on the night of the hanging, all
the cell doors were kept open?

375
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,625
Yes, which means
that Anthony Kelly

376
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,923
could have walked out
at any time but didn't.

377
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,655
And I'm also correct

378
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,874
that shortly before the incident
occurred, two other...

379
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,898
Incident?

380
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,292
You call a man hanged
an incident?

381
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,639
A man hanged in a cell
built for two prisoners

382
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,197
which was accommodating three.

383
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,235
In the Barfield rules,
there is no cell association.

384
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,438
I am sure the defense
will want to know

385
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,746
why five men were allowed
in that cell.

386
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,048
Why was Kelly in there?

387
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,732
Well, in perfect conditions,
he wouldn't have been,

388
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,247
but there was no alternative.

389
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,520
So you admit
that by an administrative error

390
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,585
you placed a young
and vulnerable boy at risk?

391
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,631
No.
I admit no such thing.

392
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,231
Good.

393
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,170
I believe if there was
any possible inference

394
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,918
that the present conditions
at Barfield might be used

395
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,605
in Anthony Kelly's defense,
if any negligence...

396
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,738
Anthony Kelly committed a crime.

397
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,012
I didn't sentence him.
I didn't send him to Barfield.

398
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,918
I'm glad to hear you have
such a positive attitude.

399
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,319
Ms. Knatchbull
is a formidable lady.

400
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,557
I have no intention of calling
you for the prosecution,

401
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,924
and I presume,

402
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,073
as you've had no contact from
Ms. Knatchbull's solicitors,

403
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,407
you are not called
for the defense?

404
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,162
If I was, it would be highly
unethical to speak to her,

405
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,930
but I am perfectly willing
to be a witness.

406
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,002
Good.

407
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,370
And I feel confident
you will prove more than a match

408
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,636
for the delectable
Ms. Knatchbull.

409
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,177
Do you think I might be called
for the defense?

410
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,479
Not if I've got in first.

411
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,360
Morning, Doctor.
How are you?

412
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,466
Are they Kelly's parents?

413
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,734
Yeah.

414
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,140
Well, here we go.

415
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,027
Death was caused
by strangulation.

416
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:39,156
The deceased had
no other external injuries.

417
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,164
On my examination,

418
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,292
the flex was still attached
to the victim's neck

419
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,392
but had been loosened,

420
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,429
as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
had been performed

421
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,167
by two auxiliary nurses.

422
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,572
Both noted the victim showed
no sign of life

423
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,508
on admittance
to the hospital wing.

424
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,547
Dr. Thomas, can you identify
that, exhibit 3,

425
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,172
as the flex
removed from the victim?

426
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,275
Uh, yes, this is the flex that I
removed from the victim's neck.

427
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,118
I ask you also to identify
the next exhibit, number 4,

428
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,418
a gray sock.

429
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,288
This item or one similar was
removed from the victim's mouth.

430
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,388
Uh, I did not remove it myself,
but Auxiliary Nurse Jones did.

431
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,523
The item was then...

432
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,659
Do you know if that was the sock
that was discovered

433
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,965
in the victim's mouth,
Dr. Thomas?

434
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,369
I really couldn't say.

435
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,270
One gray sock looks
pretty like another.

436
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,909
I'm sorry, but the said item
was, I believe,

437
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,139
put into a plastic bag
in the hospital wing

438
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,306
and removed by the police.

439
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,189
Good morning.

440
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,734
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Governor.

441
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,420
It's not a rude question,

442
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,691
but who's sort of running
my prison this morning?

443
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,925
It's not Walter Brinkley, is it?

444
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,968
Could I please check your names?

445
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,969
- Ms. Hewitt?
- Yes.

446
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,164
- Mr. Malahide?
- That's the governor.

447
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,174
- I'm sure of it.
- DCI Dunes?

448
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,368
Here.

449
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,911
- Mr. Marshall?
- Here.

450
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,537
- Mr. Clark?
- Miss.

451
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,946
Um, I was just wondering
how long I'd have to wait.

452
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,347
I'm sorry.
I really couldn't say.

453
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,645
- Mr. Clark?
- Yes.

454
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,779
- Mr. Edwards?
- Yes.

455
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:09,947
Mr. and Mrs. Kelly.

456
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,115
- Yes.
- Yes.

457
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,588
Excuse me, Ms. Hewitt.

458
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,963
No portable phones are allowed
inside the courtroom.

459
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,126
Okay.

460
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:22,964
Hello?

461
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,800
Know that all bags
are to be left at reception.

462
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,203
Next.

463
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,464
Next.

464
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,445
June Fisher,
visiting Alan Fisher.

465
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,725
Know that all bags are to be
left at reception.

466
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,876
Next.

467
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,216
Mel Snooper,
visiting Oswald Snooper.

468
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,619
Next.

469
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,419
Lastly, I questioned
Prisoner Anthony Kelly.

470
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,153
This was approximately
two and a half hours

471
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,162
after the incident had occurred.

472
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,164
He was still
in a very distressed state

473
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,097
but agreed to be interviewed.

474
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,930
May I refer to my summary,
my lord?

475
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,526
Yes.

476
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,603
Please continue.

477
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,674
Mr. Kelly stated,

478
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,903
"I was just leaving the cell
when Victor..."

479
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,912
that would be
Victor Braithwaite, my lord...

480
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,845
"walked in.

481
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,544
I was very uneasy because I had
just been given a spliff."

482
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,178
That is a marijuana cigarette,
my lord.

483
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,118
"I had never smoked one before,

484
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,456
and I was feeling sick
and dizzy."

485
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,837
Have we had his interview
transcribed?

486
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,861
No, we haven't.

487
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,637
You know I've been waiting
a long time.

488
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,139
I've done what you told me.

489
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,702
I've never brought the papers
with me

490
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,457
because they check everything
at the gates.

491
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,279
I know.

492
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,851
I know.

493
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,021
But one of the reasons
they're going to release me

494
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,751
is because they don't know
anything about the divorce.

495
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,785
I can't keep on waiting.

496
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,830
You say I can't send them,

497
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,298
but you've also got to sign
the deeds over to me.

498
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,529
They read the mail, June.
They'd know.

499
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,906
I'll sign them when I come out.

500
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,341
You've got my word.

501
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,374
I'll sign.
I promise.

502
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,112
She snores.

503
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,709
- What do you mean, she snores?
- She does.

504
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,845
Baby don't snore.

505
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,718
She does.

506
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,725
Hey, listen. Everything went
all right at the gate?

507
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,352
Yeah. They searched my bag
and my coat.

508
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,524
Arnold, I told you.
Play with your puzzle.

509
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,494
Right.
Come sit beside me.

510
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,594
He's getting to be
such a handful, you know.

511
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,766
Arnold, sit down
and stop messing about, right?

512
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,472
- You got it.
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,177
Um, is it all right
if I hold my kid?

514
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,481
Yes.

515
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,816
Cheers.

516
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,719
Okay.
Shall we go see Daddy?

517
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,225
Daddy's gonna hold you now.

518
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,521
- Come on.
- Ooh!

519
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,494
- Ooh.
- She is heavy.

520
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,664
You are heavy.

521
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,665
You eat.

522
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,326
But you're beautiful, darling.

523
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,529
You're so beautiful.

524
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,536
Where is it?

525
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,835
They checked the nappy
last time.

526
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,035
There's some under her sweater
and some in the bottle.

527
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,904
- Hey.
- Arnold, give me that.

528
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,880
- Give me this.
- Don't put it in your mouth.

529
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,914
Go oh. Give your daddy a smile.

530
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,657
Detective Chief Inspector Dunes,

531
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,959
from Anthony Kelly's interview
with you,

532
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,523
he determined that all three
were actually smoking.

533
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,694
- Is that correct?
- Yes, my lord.

534
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,967
When I questioned Kelly
regarding the smoking, um...

535
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,769
Continue.

536
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,539
He answered that Steven...
That's Mr. Wolton...

537
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,512
Was rolling them in the cell.

538
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,706
I then asked the defendant
how many he had smoked.

539
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,876
He said two.

540
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,455
And all the three
other defendants

541
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:06,424
have denied partaking
in this spliff... joint?

542
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,192
Yes, my lord.

543
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,722
Yes.
You can tell Fisher.

544
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,892
Yeah.

545
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,098
They've risen
till 10:30 tomorrow.

546
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,470
Oh, shit.

547
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,203
And I've been here
all bloody day.

548
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,486
And this is the best gear
in the street.

549
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,187
But it's expensive.
You know what I mean?

550
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,320
How much?

551
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,534
Fisher?
Fisher!

552
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,908
You've got your weekend, Alan.

553
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,410
What?
Is it this month?

554
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:02,107
Three weeks' time.
I wanted you to know.

555
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,342
Oh, thank you.

556
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,077
Thank you very much!

557
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,812
Pleased to.

558
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,117
Mr., um, Smith,
I've got to ask you...

559
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,122
Uh...

560
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,317
What is it, Brian?

561
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,451
You said it was important.

562
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,087
I've lost me paper.

563
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,291
I've lost it.
One minute.

564
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,835
I'm going out!

565
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,738
I am already totally out of it.

566
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,109
Is Ms. Hewitt
in the witness box?

567
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,484
Prosecution counsel
just called her.

568
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,921
Having interviewed
every officer on duty

569
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,185
on the night in question...

570
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,888
That included my deputy
and my senior officers...

571
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,363
I am satisfied
that there was at no time

572
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,798
any sign of disturbance
on the wing

573
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,392
and that no blame
for the tragic outcome of events

574
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,701
can be leveled at any officer
on duty that night.

575
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,206
I have no further questions,
my lord.

576
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,213
Ms. Knatchbull.

577
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,149
May I ask your age, Ms. Hewitt?

578
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,084
I'm 33.

579
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,318
Could you explain to the court
governor ranks?

580
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:23,694
Governors are scaled in ranks
from 5 upwards,

581
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,628
Governor 1 being
the highest rank.

582
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,496
And what rank from 1 to 5
are you, Ms. Hewitt?

583
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,899
I'm a Governor 3 rank.

584
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,164
How long have you been
a Governor 3 rank?

585
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,102
Nine months.

586
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,471
So you were Governor 4

587
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,533
until recently taking over
Barfield Prison,

588
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,170
a category B all-male prison?

589
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,441
Yes.
That is correct.

590
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,779
And before taking over
the running of Barfield Prison,

591
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,514
you were deputy governor
at Kettering Hall,

592
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,885
an all-female prison?

593
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,719
Yes.
That is correct.

594
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,190
You took over Barfield

595
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,159
after the highly publicized
riot.

596
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,718
My lord,
may I ask my learned friend

597
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,922
why she feels it necessary

598
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,374
to give details
of Ms. Hewitt's career

599
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,731
and what possible relevance
it can have in the case?

600
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,259
My lord, the circumstances
at Barfield Prison at that time

601
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:08,671
are very important
to the defense of Anthony Kelly.

602
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,504
You may continue,
Ms. Knatchbull.

603
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,703
Thank you, my lord.

604
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,269
Perhaps I should clarify
the reasoning

605
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,611
behind my line of questioning.

606
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,151
Anthony Kelly was placed at risk

607
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,584
the moment he was admitted
to Barfield,

608
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,020
as Ms. Hewitt is a new
and very young governor.

609
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,990
My Lord, Ms. Hewitt's
professional credibility

610
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,993
is not in question
at this trial.

611
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,937
I suggest my learned friend
should read the papers.

612
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,939
Since Ms. Hewitt took over
the running of Barfield,

613
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,488
two men escaped
in a helicopter...

614
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,624
My Lord.

615
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,368
Very well.
You may continue.

616
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,213
Ms. Hewitt,
how long was Anthony Kelly held

617
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,546
at Barfield?

618
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,778
Almost two days.

619
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,579
Did you interview him?

620
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,385
No, I did not.

621
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,127
So you didn't actually know him
at all?

622
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,253
I knew his age,

623
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,492
plus information regarding
his crime and his sentence.

624
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,127
But you did not actually see him
on his admittance?

625
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,569
Until a prisoner
has been interviewed

626
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,937
by the probation department
and the medical staff,

627
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,738
until I have received a full
and detailed report

628
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,810
regarding his needs,

629
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,371
be they educational,
medical, or domestic...

630
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,211
How long does <i>that</i> take?

631
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,719
In Anthony Kelly's situation,
almost two days.

632
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,779
I would just like to point out,
in case you're not aware of it,

633
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,382
that each wing also has
its own governor

634
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,790
and its own senior officer.

635
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,625
I'm sorry, Ms. Hewitt,
but who put Anthony Kelly,

636
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,598
a young 24-year-old
first offender,

637
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,531
into a cell with two prisoners,

638
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,038
both serving long sentences
for violent crimes?

639
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,384
- Objection, my lord.
- I object.

640
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,603
My client's previous record has
no bearing on the present case.

641
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,873
Please rephrase the question,
Ms. Knatchbull.

642
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:04,280
Ms. Hewitt, is cell 29, D Wing,
designed for two occupants?

643
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,847
Yes.
That is correct.

644
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,258
How many occupants were
allocated to cell 29, D Wing,

645
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,853
the night Colin Foster hanged?

646
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,930
Three.

647
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,125
We have heard in court today

648
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,363
that it is against
Barfield Prison regulations

649
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,463
to allow men to associate
in their cells.

650
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,343
We have also heard that on
the night Colin Foster died,

651
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,810
four men were in the cell.

652
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,574
The deceased makes five.

653
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,708
My lord, I really cannot see why
my learned friend feels obliged

654
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,343
to repeat what has already
been proved without objection.

655
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,253
Please rephrase your question,
Ms. Knatchbull.

656
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,886
Ms. Hewitt, you stated
that no officer was to be blamed

657
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,864
for the tragic events.

658
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,965
Yet surely they were
sadly lacking

659
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:54,735
in their duty that evening
to allow five men in cell 29.

660
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,173
I'm sorry.
What exactly is your question?

661
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,302
Do you admit
that there was a negligence

662
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,155
on the part of the officers
on duty that night,

663
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,240
the night Colin Foster died?

664
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,582
I'm satisfied that there
was no negligence.

665
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,812
You are satisfied?

666
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,915
That in this cramped cell,
Anthony Kelly,

667
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,861
a young 24-year-old boy who'd
never been in prison before

668
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,240
and only arrived
the day before...

669
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,733
My lord, Ms. Knatchbull
is goading the witness.

670
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:26,332
Please make your questions
more direct, Ms. Knatchbull.

671
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,275
Why was Anthony Kelly placed
in cell 29, D Wing, Ms. Hewitt?

672
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,283
I had no alternative, no other
accommodation available.

673
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,185
May I ask, Ms. Hewitt,
if you <i>had</i> had an alternative,

674
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,156
would you still have delegated
Mr. Kelly to cell 29?

675
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,555
Not necessarily.

676
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,218
Not necessarily?

677
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,156
These three men
then forced Anthony Kelly

678
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,994
to take part
in a sickening trial,

679
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,728
accusing the deceased
of being a nonce... a nonce!

680
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,429
Anthony Kelly
only 24 hours earlier

681
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,971
had never even heard
the expression.

682
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,165
Ms. Knatchbull.

683
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,675
Members of the jury, you will
please ignore the implication

684
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,908
that force was used
by any of the defendants.

685
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,951
May I ask you Ms. Hewitt,
from a humanitarian aspect,

686
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,997
do you believe any proportion
of blame can be attached

687
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,055
to Barfield Prison?

688
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,601
Ms. Knatchbull,
I take full responsibility

689
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,912
for the present running
of Barfield.

690
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,963
I am trying every possible means
to curb the use of drugs...

691
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,441
Thank you very much
for admitting responsibility.

692
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,571
I have no further questions,
my lord.

693
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,876
No questions?

694
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,219
Thank you, Ms. Hewitt.

695
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,436
I think this will be
a suitable time to adjourn.

696
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,590
Be upstanding.

697
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,498
This court stands adjourned
until 10:30 tomorrow morning.

698
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,537
Prisoners Kelly,
Reynolds, Braithwaite,

699
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,101
and Wolton are being taken back
to Barfield.

700
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,773
Transportation officer,
stand by.

701
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,844
If necessary, move him,
Mr. Gordon.

702
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,684
I do not want Anthony Kelly
harassed in any way.

703
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:24,916
Now, is that clear?

704
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,356
Right.

705
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,653
Thank you.

706
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,234
I take full responsibility.

707
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,712
We were all messing about,
and Colin...

708
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:00,816
That's Colin Foster...
He was sort of the main joker.

709
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,560
I made some remark
about him being a nonce.

710
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,598
It's a sex offender, sir.

711
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,091
Anyway, Colin takes this
the wrong way.

712
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,366
He, uh, got a bit uptight
and says, you know,

713
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,237
"If I'm a nonce, you prove it."

714
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,138
But we were still joking.

715
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,737
It wasn't serious.
It...

716
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,919
Even Colin was laughing.

717
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,015
It was just a joke.

718
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,557
If we may go on.

719
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,671
Did you ever refer to yourself
as "the hangman"?

720
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,575
No, I did not.

721
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,148
Did you give the titles
judge, jury, and solicitor

722
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,684
to any of the other members
in cell 29?

723
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,845
No.
No, I did not.

724
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,856
Did you tie the hands
of the deceased, Colin Foster,

725
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,152
behind his back?

726
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,017
No, I did not.
I never touched him.

727
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,933
Mr. Braithwaite,
did you assist in the hanging

728
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,459
of the deceased, Colin Foster,
in any way?

729
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,438
No, I did not.

730
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,108
He done it himself.

731
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,508
I have no further questions,
my lord.

732
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,449
Mr. Braithwaite,
may I ask you how long

733
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,213
you are presently serving
at Barfield Prison?

734
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,116
Fourteen years.

735
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,626
I beg your pardon,
Mr. Braithwaite.

736
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,328
Fourteen years.

737
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,127
Mr. Braithwaite, were you,

738
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,169
on the evening
of Colin Foster's death,

739
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,798
smoking illegal substances
in cell 29?

740
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,432
No, I was not.

741
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,501
I've never in my life smoked
cannabis resin or marijuana.

742
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,909
I can't.
I've got asthma.

743
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,208
Oh. I see.

744
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,341
Why were you in cell 29 on the
evening of Colin Foster's death?

745
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,153
I was just getting in
some tobacco.

746
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,712
But you have just
stated that you did not smoke

747
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,816
because you have asthma.

748
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,455
He got up on the chair.

749
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,162
He was just fooling, like,
and then...

750
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,103
Oh, yeah. Officer Malahide,
I think, uh, walked past.

751
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,105
Or somebody did.

752
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,732
You hearing all this, Anthony?

753
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,107
You getting it all, Anthony?

754
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,155
You'd better be hearing this
good, Anthony. Understand me?

755
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,273
You do the right thing, son,

756
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,044
we're all on the same place,
right?

757
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,729
I just thought
he were kidding, you know?

758
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,984
His body was all limp, you see,
and...

759
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,623
It was just a joke.

760
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,194
No further questions, my lord.

761
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,492
Could I ask how long
you are serving

762
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,001
your present sentence,
Mr. Wolton?

763
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,940
Please answer the question,
Mr. Wolton.

764
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,906
Five years.

765
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,949
Thank you.
I have no further questions.

766
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,747
I didn't even take any notice.
I was reading.

767
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,084
They was just messing about,
so I kept reading.

768
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,317
Next thing Colin,
he was on the floor.

769
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,791
Then the alarm went, and
Mr. Malahide came running in.

770
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,724
Colin didn't make a sound
or call out.

771
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,823
They were laughing one second,
and then...

772
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,163
I was told he was dead.

773
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,162
I have no further questions,
my lord.

774
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,102
Mr. Reynolds, could I ask you

775
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,854
how long you were acquainted
with my client

776
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,469
before this unfortunate
and tragic incident took place?

777
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,104
No more than a day and a half.

778
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,375
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

779
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,110
There's just one more question.

780
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,627
Could I ask how long
you're presently serving

781
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,415
at Barfield Prison?

782
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,353
Eleven years.

783
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,322
I have no further questions.
Thank you, my lord.

784
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,652
You were reading a book,
they were messing around,

785
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,894
and the deceased made no sound,
he did not call out.

786
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,662
Am I correct, Mr. Reynolds?

787
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,964
Yes.

788
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,164
Like they was cracking jokes.
Know what I mean?

789
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,868
I'm trying to know
what you mean, Mr. Reynolds.

790
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,672
I believe that the length
of your cell

791
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,221
would be about the same
as the distance

792
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,770
between Ms. Knatchbull
and myself.

793
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,145
Would you agree?

794
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,274
Maybe.

795
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,180
Maybe.

796
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,015
Well, we can give you
a few inches,

797
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,748
but the distance is not great.

798
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,484
It is, by any estimation,
very small and claustrophobic,

799
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,491
Is it not?

800
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,686
I don't know.

801
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,354
There are five men
in this small space,

802
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,161
including yourself.

803
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,292
Am I correct?

804
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,498
Yes, it's only a double cell,

805
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,435
but they moved in an extra bunk
for Kelly.

806
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,940
See, Anthony?
We're all backing each other.

807
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,374
If we all do it,
none of us will go down for it.

808
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,641
Only needs one of us
to screw it up, Anthony.

809
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,182
Don't even think about it.

810
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,582
Tied the other end
to an air vent,

811
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,519
fell from the chair,
breaking his neck.

812
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:01,651
And you... you, Mr. Reynolds...
Did not see anything

813
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,218
because you were immersed
in your book?

814
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,132
I had earplugs in.

815
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:29,785
Mr. Kelly, you will be
in the witness box tomorrow.

816
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,886
Do you mind if I sit down?

817
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,222
No.

818
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,033
I want you to be very positive.

819
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:50,235
I want you to tell the court
exactly what you have told me.

820
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,939
Um...

821
00:41:56,948 --> 00:42:00,350
So much has happened since then,
I, um...

822
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,614
I-I can't remember it all.

823
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,191
Every time I think about it,
I...

824
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:17,058
I feel the same way over again.

825
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,203
They're all lying.

826
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,407
We were all smoking,
Ms. Knatchbull.

827
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,413
They're lying.

828
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,746
Yes, I know.

829
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,753
But you tell the truth.

830
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,221
It'll go against me,
though, won't it?

831
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,587
I was stoned.

832
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,825
Anthony, I will have to ask you
why you didn't leave the cell.

833
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,526
They wouldn't let me!

834
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,158
Yes!

835
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,635
Now, you just remember that,
because if they had,

836
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,696
you wouldn't be on trial
for murder.

837
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,777
You not up for your breakfast,
then, Norman?

838
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,329
You sick?

839
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,763
I am not sick!

840
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,211
My lord, I now ask
to call Anthony Kelly.

841
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,787
That bastard Norman Jones
has taken Mr. Morgan hostage.

842
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,382
Oh, my God.
Come on.

843
00:43:57,702 --> 00:43:59,102
Ask me nicely.

844
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,263
Go on.

845
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,538
Prisoner Norman Jones
is locked inside his cell

846
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,151
- with Officer Morgan.
- Down on your knees.

847
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,837
We have a hostage situation.

848
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,572
Over.

849
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,170
Don't do this, Norman.

850
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:12,115
I know what they're going to do
to me,

851
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,743
so I want a bit of respect!

852
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:20,619
Get... down... on... your... knees!

853
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,204
Please let me out of your cell,
Norman.

854
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,276
You shagging gorillas!

855
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,718
I'll kill every one of you!

856
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,188
Let me go!
Get off me!

857
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,816
Every last one of you monsters
are trash!

858
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,223
Stay out of here.

859
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,198
Russell, it's me... Gary.

860
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,933
Screw it!

861
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,529
Okay.

862
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,877
Back off. Go on.
Back off.

863
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,435
Go on, lads. Move it.

864
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,042
Sit him down.

865
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,549
Come on.

866
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,248
I'm okay.

867
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,316
- You sure?
- I'm okay.

868
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,368
I'm okay.

869
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,740
Do you smoke, Mr. Kelly?

870
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,003
No, I don't.

871
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,136
On the night of your first day
in Barfield Prison,

872
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,680
were you offered any substances
to smoke?

873
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,274
No, I was not.

874
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,080
Mr. Kelly... can I just clarify?

875
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,147
When I asked you
if you were smoking substances,

876
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,490
I was not referring
to ordinary cigarettes.

877
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,291
Now I ask you again...

878
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:09,960
On the night that Colin Foster
died in cell 21, D Wing,

879
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,560
were you offered any substances
to smoke?

880
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,031
No, I was not.

881
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,281
So you were not under
the influence of any narcotics

882
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:28,752
during the so-called
kangaroo court held in cell 29?

883
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,389
No... I was not.

884
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,207
I'll need a full report
as to how Norman Jones

885
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,299
was able to take Morgan hostage.

886
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,502
Mm-hmm.

887
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,408
What's the update on the trial?

888
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,006
I left just before Kelly went
into the witness box.

889
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:01,482
I think she might get him off,
you know.

890
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,083
He is innocent.
We all know it.

891
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,351
Yeah.
To a point.

892
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,085
Kelly put himself in that cell.

893
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,152
He did it when he committed
his first crime.

894
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,931
Fooling around?

895
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,135
I wonder if you'd clarify that,
Mr. Kelly.

896
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,239
Colin, um, took some flex
out of his own pocket.

897
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,773
He said he wasn't a-a nonce

898
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,411
and he would prove it
by hanging himself.

899
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,123
Just out of court.

900
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,994
Anthony Kelly denied
everything...

901
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,464
Smoking pot, the lot.

902
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,161
His counsel couldn't budge him.

903
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,259
What?

904
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,804
Well, they got to him,
didn't they?

905
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,396
Stupid little bugger lied.

906
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:02,912
Damn it!

907
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,082
I'm sorry.
It's bad news.

908
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:09,950
Well, for Kelly.

909
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,126
Let me have a look at Norman,
see if he needs to be sedated.

910
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,101
Seen enough?!

911
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,103
You want some more?!

912
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,139
Okay!

913
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,138
No. I think we should let him
cool off.

914
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,576
Wait till he comes
to his senses... or not.

915
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,113
You're not going in there
with him.

916
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,183
And I want that belt off him.

917
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,117
Are <i>you</i> gonna do it?

918
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,187
I'll tell you what.

919
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,156
You can use one of those darts
they use in zoos

920
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,782
to knock out a rhino.

921
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,726
Anthony John Kelly,

922
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:52,127
in his interview
with the police,

923
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:56,099
made it plain
that drugs were being smoked,

924
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,659
that his co-defendants tried
and hanged

925
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,534
the deceased, Colin Foster.

926
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,472
Before you today, he has denied
that version of events

927
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,205
and said that Colin Foster
hanged himself.

928
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,073
Now it is up to you to decide
if this retraction

929
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:17,349
of his statement taken
by DCI Dunes is now the truth.

930
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,248
If it's capable
of being believed,

931
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,193
then Anthony Kelly
is entitled to be acquitted.

932
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,260
Harry Reynolds
and Steven Wolton, seven years,

933
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,235
Victor Braithwaite, 11 years.

934
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,430
Bloody hell.

935
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:34,665
What about Kelly?

936
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,847
He's all yours for
the next six years, Ms. Hewitt.

937
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,212
I hope you can live with it.

938
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,680
Anthony John Kelly
was an innocent.

939
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,949
You should have protected him.

939
00:49:52,305 --> 00:50:52,903
