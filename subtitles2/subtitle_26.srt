That's quite all right.

141
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,176
The top button seems
to have caught

142
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,437
As I was unloading my luggage
on the train.

143
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,623
Normally I wouldn't mind
being one button short,

144
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,461
But first impressions
being what they are.

145
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,539
If the lady will allow, I can
mend it in just a moment.

00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,858
Go right ahead.

147
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,555
And take your time.

148
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,721
We seem to have stumbled upon
each other indisposed, miss.

149
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:28,818
And exposed, sir.

150
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,713
I'll forgive your bad impression
if you forgive mine.

They ripped.

156
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,483
I guess I am to become
one of the many women

Parading about town
with painted seams

On the back of
their bare legs.

159
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:54,010
It's unladylike
and uncomfortable.

00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,161
Well, I may not be able to
soothe the issue of comfort

But I can assure you
that no gentleman

Will be staring
at your legs.

So, you're saying
you're no gentleman?

Please excuse Joel's silence.

I hope you are prepared to work
in exchange for your tuition.

You will not be working
in the office.

302

You will be helping out with the
yard-work here at foxworth hall.

I'd be happy to, sir.

304

Daddy, surely you can't
expect him to work

Alongside nella's family
and the rest of the servants.

show your uncle to his room?

How do you feel about
sneaking out this afternoon?

323

I must say I did not expect this
house to be quite what it is,

Or for you to be

Almost nothing at all.

You have to know what the police
would do to a black man

333
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,442
They think stole from
a white man like father.

How can I when Harry
could be dead?

336

You saw what they did to him in
full view on our own front lawn.

337

Just imagine what they're doing
to him in jail.

338
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,714
We have to do something.

339
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,901
This wasn't Harry's fault.

340
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:03,480
It's something we came to
together, willingly.

341
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:05,327
It's what we both want.

Where are you?

343

Someone you love
is pleading with you

344

That someone they love
is hurting.

This is fine.
Don't go any further.

Thanks for giving me a way
out of the house.

school doesn't teach Patience.

please don't mention

Why do you care?

367
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,263

working already?

That your father's still
at the office

And your mother is getting
her dress fitted.

So, if you're looking
for a way to sneak in

You might try through
the kitchen.

But now maybe I won't
tell you that.

Not if you want to keep
your practice.

You will pack one bag and I will

So nobody sees us.

Now the professionals there
will... Get it out of you.

635
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:33,040
It's wrapped around
your leg.

636
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,768
So, I guess I owe you.

637
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:38,882
For some reason I still
feel like I owe you.

638
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:53,302

639
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:57,109
[âª]

640
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:04,241
Malcolm: Corrine!

641
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,619
<i>Corrine!</i>

642
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,579
She's in here!

643
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,917
[thunder crashing]

644
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:34,751
Oh, thank goodness.

645
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:36,678
Are you all right?
Can you walk?

646
00:47:36,762 --> 00:47:38,755
Put me down please, daddy.

647
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,016
Just a few scrapes.
She was lucky.

648
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,184
Lucky you found me.

649
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:45,595
It was you?
Thank you.

650
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,356
I'm so sorry.

651
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,525
As you should be.

652
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:52,164
I'll call the doctor
in the morning.

653
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,181
I know you don't agree with
all of my choices as a mother,

654
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:58,959
And many days neither do I.

655
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,629
But I'm doing my best.

656
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,217
Joel will get better
if we let him.

657
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:12,714
I think I've had enough of
the world outside for one day.

658
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:14,624
Just want to go to bed.

659
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,035
Of course.

660
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,646
Do you need some help
getting up the stairs?

661
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,734
I think I can manage.

662
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:24,905
Good night.

663
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,159
Thank you.

664
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:32,159
How can we ever thank you?

665
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,476
There's no need.

666
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,163
Corrine's safety's
all I care about.

667
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,406
Well, good night.

668
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,833
I have an early start tomorrow.

669
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,151
No, you don't.

670
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:43,987
You no longer work for me.

671
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,156
You have more than paid
your debt.

672
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,513
From now on your education
is paid for in full.

673
00:48:57,009 --> 00:49:00,079
You should be lying down.

674
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:02,172
I couldn't lie still
if I tried.

675
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:04,083
I thought you were done
with the world for today.

676
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,362
I am.

677
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,573
That one.

678
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:14,535
What we stumbled into
in that storm...

679
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,852
Words like stumbled...

680
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,596
It can never happen again.

681
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,374
You make it sound like
it was an accident.

682
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,524
I'm your uncle.

683
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:24,798
Half... Uncle.

684
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:31,552
We lost ourselves.
I was worried about you.

685
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,099
I was just trying to make sure
you were all right.

686
00:49:37,216 --> 00:49:38,875
That wasn't a worried kiss.

687
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,064
It wasn't a proper one either.

688
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,964
You're right.
Um, then it never happened.

689
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:53,556
I apologize.

690
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,652
You're not the only one
who feels sorry about it.

691
00:49:56,736 --> 00:50:00,656
If you want to be dancing
in time for your ball,

692
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,752
You should get some rest.

693
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:11,833
What about Christopher?

694
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:15,320
Many debutants have used their
uncles for their first dance.

695
00:50:15,404 --> 00:50:17,489
Or fathers.

696
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:20,083
It should be someone closer
to her own age.

697
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,268
Since you two have become
so close

698
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,345
I think it's only appropriate.

699
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:25,497
Christopher is a part
of our family now.

700
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:26,999
Surely my Princess,

701
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,444
You wouldn't mind if I gave you
that first dance.

702
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,005
Christopher, would you do
corrine the honor?

703
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:35,115
Actually, I was thinking
my friend rockford

704
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,509
Could be my first dance.

705
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:39,511
Your friend?

706
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:41,121
You have a male friend.

707
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,667
Rockford taylard.

708
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:46,213
You knew about this male friend
of hers?

709
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,614
Oh, daddy.

710
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:53,525
Who doesn't know of
the taylards?

711
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,545
Mr. Taylard owns the textile
mills just outside of town,

712
00:50:56,629 --> 00:50:58,864
And his son rockford

713
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:02,292
Is just a very sweet
and disciplined young man

714
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,386
Who I happen to have
crossed paths with

715
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,816
At events here and there.

716
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,042
[sighs]

717
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:11,634
And plus he has just finished
his first year

718
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,879
At the blacksburg school
of business.

719
00:51:13,963 --> 00:51:15,397
Are you sure you want to share
your first dance

720
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:17,140
With a relative stranger?

721
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:19,412
Rockford's not a stranger.

722
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,488
Corrine.

723
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,899
You do realize what
you're doing here.

724
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:35,400
Mother...

725
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:38,161
I know why you're hesitant,
but rock's changed.

726
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,756
You don't yet know
what changes a man.

727
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,184
He is still the same person
that defiled you.

728
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,853
Remember that.

729
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:49,081
And remember what we had
to do because of it.

730
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:52,195
Mrs. Foxworth,
a visitor for you.

731
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,369
Mrs. Steiner?
What a surprise.

732
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,539
I'm going to make this brief
Mrs. Foxworth,

733
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,932
Since I don't much enjoy

734
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:10,693
Being in the company
of a person like you

735
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:16,441
Who stains the honor of
a great house like this.

736
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:19,887
I know about
your son's problem.

737
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,224
What problem?

738
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:26,479
The west more land sanitarium.

739
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,631
Three grand.

740
00:52:39,715 --> 00:52:43,302
I'll come by to collect it
next weekend.

741
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:46,246
Unless, of course, you want
the whole world to find out

742
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,659
That your boy is a...
Homosexual.

743
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:57,927
[âª]

744
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:12,664
How does she know?

745
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:14,333
The important thing
is that she does

746
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,443
And that she's threatening
to ruin our son.

747
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,854
Joel is in the hospital
trying to get better.

748
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:21,281
If we don't pay her off
it will all be for nothing.

749
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,702
[sighs]

750
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,707
We can't have your
reputation ruined.

751
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,108
I'll arrange for the money.

752
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,020
...And you care for him?

753
00:53:35,104 --> 00:53:36,630
He's exactly what I need.

754
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,800
The complete opposite to
our overly-complicated family.

755
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,693
No one can change
who they care for,

756
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:43,348
Not for anything
in the world.

757
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,701
What about me?

758
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:51,478
Well, of course I care
about you.

759
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,372
Could you from far away?

760
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,891
What are you talking about?

761
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,237
I'm leaving.

762
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,154
What? Why?
You're getting better.

763
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:01,713
And if I stay here
that won't happen.

764
00:54:01,797 --> 00:54:03,243
Not really.

765
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:08,748
What about Harry?

766
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,379
I don't know.

767
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:23,763

00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:42,449

[âª]

773
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,079
I thought you'd still be
at the office.

774
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,416
I'm leaving.

775
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:03,337
How did you get out of
the hospital?

776
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:08,508
I don't want anything and
I'll never bother you again.

777
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:13,588
If you run, you will never be
welcome back here again.

778
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:15,073
I know.

779
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:17,242
I will say that you are
no longer my son.

780
00:57:17,326 --> 00:57:19,669
Well, you were never much
of a father to me anyway.

781
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:23,190
And I will write you out
of my will.

782
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:26,279
I don't want your money if
it'd give me a life like yours.

783
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:33,033
I'll ask you one last time.

784
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,684
How did you get out
of that hospital?

785
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:38,291
It was me.
I brought him home.

786
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:50,366
You took him out of
the sanitarium

787
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,460
Without consulting me!

788
00:57:52,544 --> 00:57:53,973
Wait for me.

789
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:02,287
I went to visit him.
He was unrecognizable.

790
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:04,380
- We were fixing him.
- We were breaking him.

791
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:06,549
No, you already did.

792
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,810
Just like you broke
our other son!

793
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:10,404
Mal's death was

Why would you do that?

You're jealous of corrine
for her beauty, for her charm.
