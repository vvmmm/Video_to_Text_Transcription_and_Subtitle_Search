00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,968
<i>Last season</i>
<i>on</i> <font color=#fffc40>"That Girl Lay Lay"...</font>

2
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:03,813
I was talking
to my positive affirmation app.

3
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,253
<i>You got this, Sadie.</i>

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,722
It would be so cool
if you were here.

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,491
I wish you were real.

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,127
Ah!

7
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,828
<i>You can freeze time?</i>

8
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,264
Mom, Dad, I was wondering
if we could be

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,399
Lay Lay's host family.

10
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,534
It would be like
a wish come true.

11
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,169
I hear everything.

12
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,004
No one knows you're
the avatar I wished to life.

13
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,299
Yeah!

14
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:24,463
What?

15
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,399
I can explain.

16
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,831
Explain that.

17
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,089
Okay, Marky.
We need to talk.

18
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:41,040
Now, this is how you
make a bed the right way.

19
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,677
And this it's how you make

20
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:49,336
a bed the Lay Lay way.

21
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,695
What's wrong with you?

22
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,882
What's wrong with you?

23
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,956
Anyway, have you seen
Marky yet?

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,758
Not since he found out
you're an avatar

25
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:00,126
that came out of my phone.

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,828
Girl, I've never seen
someone scream so loud

27
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,096
and run so fast.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,366
And I've seen your father
around a cricket.

29
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,902
And that's after we
explained everything to Marky.

30
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,138
Yeah.
Now that he knows my secret,

31
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:14,106
we got to make sure he's cool.

32
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,641
Otherwise, he's gonna tell
your parents.

33
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:17,443
And they'll know
we've been lying to them.

34
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,139
There's nothing my parents hate
more than liars.

35
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,366
Maybe raisins and coleslaw,
but liars are up there.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,818
Hopefully, he's
not freaking out.

37
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,308
I'm still freaking out.

38
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:32,758
I can't believe I've been
around Lay Lay this long

39
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,261
and never noticed
anything strange about her.

40
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,897
Or did I notice,
and you made me forget?

41
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,165
Do you have mind-wipe powers?

42
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,045
Stop wiping my mind.

43
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,002
She didn't.
You just didn't notice

44
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,600
anything strange about her.

45
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,163
Because there's nothing
strange to notice.

46
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,242
Besides, you're a 10-year-old
who wears a sweater vest.

47
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,389
I wouldn't talk, little one.

48
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,320
Marky, this is a good thing.

49
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,550
When Lay Lay was
in my phone,

50
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:58,684
she was an avatar

51
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,885
for my positive affirmation
app.

52
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,273
Yes.
I'm really good

53
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,454
at helping people become

54
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:03,923
the best versions
of themselves.

55
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,157
Look at me.

56
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,392
Because of Lay Lay,
I'm more outgoing,

57
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,561
and I'm the president
of my class now.

58
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,598
She even gave me the confidence
to become an era-era DJ.

59
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:15,401
Some people say
I got it going in...

60
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,402
On?

61
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,570
Out?

62
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,439
Whatever.
People are talking.

63
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,274
I'm talking about how,
just 12 hours ago,

64
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,009
I saw you turn invisible.

65
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,945
Okay.
Did it scare you?

66
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,013
Please.
I'm done freaking out.

67
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:30,771
Okay.

68
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:33,986
- Boo!
- Ah!

69
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,855
I was wrong.

70
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,290
I'm still freaking out!

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,074
ENJOY ALL VOD IN HIGH QUALITY @ 4KVOD.TV
GET LIVE TV,MOVIES,SHOWS IN ONE PACKAGE

72
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,970
This is either
their happy dance,

73
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,327
or they stepped
in some fire ants.

74
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,609
Girls, we just got some

75
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,594
of the best news
of our careers.

76
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,898
Oh, let me guess, Bun B
sampled one of your songs,

77
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,467
and now you're rich, so we can
spend the rest of our lives

78
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,405
on private jets and yachts.

79
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,143
No, but thank you for making
our good news less exciting.

80
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,812
We were named Advertising
Songwriters of the Year

81
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,415
by the Cleveland Hall of Fame
Music Awards.

82
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,150
Whoa!

83
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,451
You won a CHoFMA?

84
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,954
That's how John Legend
became John Legend.

85
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,990
Before he won a CHoFMA,
he was just John.

86
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,625
There's a fancy ceremony
coming up,

87
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,027
and anybody who's anybody
in the biz attends.

88
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,797
Winning an award like this
triples your business.

89
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,900
So maybe there
will be a yacht.

90
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,070
There ain't gonna be
no yachts.

91
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:43,807
Look, can't you just
be happy for us?

92
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,843
Bryce, tell them who we're
asking to introduce us.

93
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,279
Our friend,
hip-hop superstar...

94
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,480
Iggy Azalea.

95
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,484
Really?
You stole my thunder?

96
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,821
Mr. A, you know Iggy Azalea?

97
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,158
Oh, you're not as lame
as Sadie says you are.

98
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,593
I never said lame.

99
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,319
I said... I love you, daddy.

100
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,799
Iggy is the perfect person
to do it.

101
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,002
Yeah, we co-wrote a jingle
with her before she blew up.

102
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,737
We're practically peers.

103
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,238
Yeah, just like
Mrs. A's workout buddy

104
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,339
is Michelle Obama.

105
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,942
Right.

106
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:23,980
Michelle wishes she had
this arm definition.

107
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,882
And every year, the CHoFMA
recipient gets to pick someone

108
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,219
to perform at the ceremony.

109
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,189
Oh, here's a crazy idea
that isn't so crazy.

110
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,724
What if Lay Lay and I perform?

111
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,827
Oh, girls, I'm sorry.

112
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,596
I think what the music awards
are looking for

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,765
is more of a big-name act.

114
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,602
What's bigger than someone
with two names?

115
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,370
Come on, Mom and Dad,
we want to perform

116
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,640
in front of Iggy Azalea,
and this is your big night.

117
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,741
We want to be a part of it.

118
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,244
Please, Mrs. A.
I won't beg you,

119
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,701
but I will make Sadie do it.

120
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,986
Okay, but you girls got
to bring your A game.

121
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,254
Yes.

122
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,111
We get to perform
in front of Iggy Azalea.

123
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,696
Sounds like it's gonna be
a big night for all of us.

124
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,230
Oh, what was that dance
you all were doing

125
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,198
when we walked out here?

126
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,055
Hmm.

127
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,939
âª I'm Sadie's
affirmation app âª

128
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,075
âª And so no matter
what happens, I got her back âª

129
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,544
âª 'Cause see my homey Sadie
wished on a star âª

130
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,678
âª She said,
"I wish you were real" âª

131
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,013
âª Now I'm as real as you are âª

132
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,581
âª And now who's coming
out the app? âª

133
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,982
<i>âª That girl Lay Lay âª</i>

134
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,351
<i>âª Who's avatar power
is to freeze? âª</i>

135
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,752
<i>âª That girl Lay Lay âª</i>

136
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,354
<i>âª All day, all day,
it's your girl âª</i>

137
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,511
<i>âª That girl, that girl,
that girl Lay Lay âª</i>

138
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,183
Okay.

139
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,647
I think I got all
the freaking out out.

140
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,397
Do you want to hear
about Lay Lay's other powers?

141
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,565
There's more?

142
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,632
Can you fly?

143
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,030
Shoot lasers out of your eyes?

144
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:53,233
Turn broccoli into brownies?

145
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,616
No.

146
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:56,646
Lay Lay's powers
are related to the phone.

147
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,281
When she holds her breath
and disappears,

148
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,517
it's like a phone
going into rest mode.

149
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:04,888
And have you ever hit
pause on a video?

150
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:05,955
Whoa.

151
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,357
How is that possible?

152
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,114
Anything's possible
when you're this fabulous.

153
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:14,898
Okay.

154
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:16,566
So I can't catch,

155
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,736
but I can freeze time.

156
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,604
And if there's anyone
I don't want to freeze,

157
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:22,872
I just have
to think about them.

158
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,474
Wait, have you ever frozen me
before,

159
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:25,542
and I didn't know it?

160
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,676
Wait.

161
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,644
Have you ever frozen me
before,

162
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,200
and I didn't know it?

163
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,849
Of course not, Marky.

164
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,106
I didn't think so.
I'm way too smart for that.

165
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,322
What did Mom and Dad say when
they learned about Lay Lay?

166
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:40,657
Oh!

167
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,660
Uh, I'll never forget
what they said.

168
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,883
Right?
What'd they say, Lay Lay?

169
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,968
Uh, they said, "Wow,"
and... and "Whoa,"

170
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:55,038
and then your mom...

171
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,473
She was like, "Whee!"

172
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:58,808
Hey, kids.

173
00:06:58,892 --> 00:06:59,943
Hey, Dad.

174
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:01,611
How come you never
told me Lay Lay...

175
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:04,380
Marky, Mr. A doesn't want
to talk

176
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:06,182
about me being an avatar.

177
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,417
Yeah.

178
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,119
He's so over Lay Lay
and her powers.

179
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:14,657
Wait a minute.

180
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,293
You never told them.

181
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:19,762
I certainly don't not did.

182
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,464
You're doing that weird
double negative thing

183
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:22,632
when you lie.

184
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,902
I certainly am
not not doing that.

185
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,326
Sadie, this is why I
never play spades with you.

186
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,443
You are the only other person
besides us

187
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,877
who knows the secret.

188
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:36,613
Well, there's also a goat
who knows everything,

189
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,514
but she ain't no snitch.

190
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,016
Wait.

191
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,452
If I'm the only one that knows,
that means you two

192
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,753
need me to keep this secret.

193
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,409
And you know that means?

194
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,524
That we have a bond
more sacred

195
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,493
than a pinky promise?

196
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:51,761
No.

197
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,696
It means you two
work for me now,

198
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,100
or I tell Mom and Dad
everything.

199
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,690
You wouldn't dare.

200
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:01,671
Who am I talking to?

201
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,806
Of course he would dare.

202
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,975
Lay Lay,
we have to do what he says.

203
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,077
Ugh!

204
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:10,768
How come I never told you
Lay Lay was what, Marky?

205
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,651
That Lay Lay is
such a good mime.

206
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:15,985
Sadie, too.

207
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,175
Show them
trapped-in-the-box, girls.

208
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:25,962
Okay.

209
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,430
Why don't you guys stay
locked in that box,

210
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:31,334
and I'll just leave?

211
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:32,702
- Oh, that was close.
- Yeah.

212
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:34,404
Good cover, Marky.

213
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,372
It's nice to have you
on team Lay Lay.

214
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:37,573
Oh, no.

215
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,609
From now on,
this is team Marky,

216
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,412
and I need a fan
and foot rub stat.

217
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,314
Say what now?

218
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,481
Why would we ever do that?

219
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:50,253
Mom?
Dad?

220
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:51,554
Oh, yeah.

221
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,145
This is gonna work out
just fine.

222
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:01,747
Marky's been
wearing me out, Sadie.

223
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,450
He had me freeze time twice
just so he could get a snack

224
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,051
during his favorite TV show.

225
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,888
Just press pause, Marky.

226
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,857
I know.
I made the snacks.

227
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,559
But I snuck down here
to work on our song.

228
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:16,662
Good, because we really need
to rehearse for the CHoFMAs.

229
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:18,063
It's your parents' big night,

230
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:20,065
and Iggy Azalea
is gonna be there.

231
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,333
We got to bring it.

232
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,303
Oh, it's been brung.

233
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:34,046
Come on.

234
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,347
Come on.

235
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,348
You like that?
You like that?

236
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,416
All right.

237
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,151
Come on.
Break with me, girl.

238
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,086
And break it with me, girl.
Break it with me.

239
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,288
Break it with me.

240
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:43,289
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

241
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,658
Oh, no shimmy.

242
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,194
No shimmy?

243
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:49,261
I can't.

244
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:53,065
Oh, I've never heard
you hiccup before.

245
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,002
You okay, Lay Lay, or was
my dancing just that bad?

246
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:59,071
Marky has been nonstop
with his demands.

247
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:03,776
He had me use my powers
a million times today,

248
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,512
and your dancing is that bad.

249
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:09,281
If it isn't
my favorite girls.

250
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,284
Ugh!

251
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,553
I've got
a new entrepreneurial endeavor

252
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,789
that you two are gonna love
helping me with,

253
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:20,025
because I said so.

254
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:22,595
Marky, we've got to practice
for our performance,

255
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,763
and Lay Lay is tired
from all your demands.

256
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,132
Stop power tripping
on her powers.

257
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,468
I hear you, but I've got
financial independence

258
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,036
to achieve.

259
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,771
That's why I invested in a new
instant hair removal cream

260
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:34,607
called InstaShave.

261
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:37,042
What do you know
about hair removal?

262
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,378
The closest thing you have
to a mustache

263
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:42,181
is ketchup on your lip.

264
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,149
I don't need it,
but the A-listers

265
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,618
at the CHoFMAs will.

266
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:47,553
And if the right celebrity
gets a hold of InstaShave,

267
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:49,321
my business will boom.

268
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,589
Uh-uh.

269
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,191
I see where this is going.

270
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,994
You want us to use
InstaShave on our heads.

271
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:56,128
What?

272
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,863
I'm not doing that.

273
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,033
- These buns are...
- Iconic.

274
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,434
Calm down.

275
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,770
All the celebrities get
gift bags full of swag.

276
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,705
You think I don't know
what swag is?

277
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:09,408
Look at me.

278
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:13,045
All I need you to do is sneak
some samples of InstaShave

279
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,680
into the CHoFMA swag bag
so that every celebrity

280
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:15,814
leaves with it.

281
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,082
What if we say...

282
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,284
No?

283
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:19,518
I'll say...

284
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,454
Mom, Dad!

285
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,290
Fine.
Whatever you want, Marky.

286
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:27,240
Or I can take
this lovely pillow

287
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,010
and smack the snitch
out of him.

288
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:30,712
No, Lay Lay.
Put the pillow down.

289
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,413
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no.

290
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,482
- Hey, stop!
- You want to do this?

291
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,717
- Let me do this!
- No.

292
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:36,684
- No more.
- Let me go.

293
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:37,685
Hey, bad Lay Lay.

294
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,686
Bad Lay Lay.

295
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,321
Bad, bad, bad.

296
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,365
Honey, how are we
supposed to know what

297
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,501
Iggy Azalea's assistant
looks like?

298
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,069
They all look the same...

299
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,672
Computery, glasses,
pale, and weak

300
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:00,908
from too much screen time.

301
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,010
Hi.
I'm Jasmine,

302
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:06,714
the pale and weak assistant
you're here to meet.

303
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:08,249
You're Iggy Azalea's
assistant?

304
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,351
- Yeah.
- But you're so young.

305
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:14,021
Am I, or are you
just really old?

306
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,656
Listen, little girl...

307
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,291
Uh, thank you.

308
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,061
Thank you for taking the time
to meet with us.

309
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,830
So Iggy would love to give
your presentation speech.

310
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,699
Yes!

311
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,534
I celebrated too soon,
didn't I?

312
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,970
Little bit.

313
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,339
As her new assistant,
I need to make sure

314
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,775
that she's associating
with the right people.

315
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:35,543
Mrs. Alexander,
it's to my understanding

316
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,378
that you're a bit of a...

317
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:40,281
diva.

318
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,949
Excuse me?

319
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,452
Oh, no, you said the D word.

320
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,287
Iggy said you got
into an argument with her

321
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,222
the last time
you worked together.

322
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:50,158
Oh, no, she's still
hung up on that?

323
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:51,826
I wouldn't call it
an argument.

324
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,863
It's just she was wrong,
and I was right.

325
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:59,300
And apparently,
you told her that, a lot.

326
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:01,102
It was a jingle
for Hooper's Hot Tubs,

327
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,904
but it was so long ago,
who can even remember...

328
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,305
Okay.

329
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,575
She wanted
âª Ooh, my, my, buy a hot tub âª

330
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,177
But I knew it should be

331
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:13,447
âª My, my, ooh,
buy a hot tub âª

332
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,448
You heard it.

333
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,105
I was right.

334
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:17,985
Should I be talking to you?

335
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,788
I think that would be best.

336
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,090
The only way Iggy is willing
to introduce you two

337
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,793
is if I get a video
of her apologizing.

338
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,328
Okay.

339
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,429
I understand.

340
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:29,530
Come on, baby.

341
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:30,731
Say you're sorry.

342
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,099
Oh, that's not it.

343
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:33,835
Iggy wants Trish to do
an "I'm sorry" dance

344
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,370
so she can share it
with her millions of followers.

345
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,172
Oh, and you're gonna love
this song.

346
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:42,665
It goes
âª Ooh, my, my, I'm sorry âª

347
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:45,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,582
I'm sorry that you wasted
your breath

349
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,684
singing that nonsense.

350
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:53,521
Honey, honey, having
Iggy Azalea introduce us

351
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:54,722
would be a huge deal.

352
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,692
Just... just apologize.

353
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,660
Who cares now?

354
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:02,163
No.

355
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:05,099
Please, baby, baby, please.

356
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,690
No, baby, baby, no.

357
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,206
You have 24 hours
to change your mind.

358
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,075
I'll be here same time
tomorrow.

359
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,610
Oh, right.

360
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,980
I ordered lunch,
but now I'm not hungry.

361
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:22,083
Iggy would want you
to pay for it.

362
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,051
Okay, bye.

363
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:30,992
What even is InstaShave?

364
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:35,796
Sweet James Brown,
Marky is going to need

365
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,900
more than a celebrity
endorsement to sell this goop.

366
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,068
Oh, yeah.

367
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:43,204
That stuff definitely works,

368
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:47,441
because it just burned out
all my nose hairs.

369
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,710
Okay.
These are custom labels

370
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:52,079
with my adorable smile on them.

371
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:55,371
No one could say no
to this face.

372
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,687
You want us to put those
labels on every single one

373
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:00,855
of these containers?

374
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:01,856
Oh, not just these.

375
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,291
There's 12 more boxes.

376
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,326
So you girls had better
get a move on.

377
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,882
Toodles.

378
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,586
Let's get to work.

379
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,916
As long as we're
under Marky's thumb,

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,017
we're never gonna get a chance

381
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,352
to rehearse for the CHoFMAs,

382
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:33,554
and we can't let
my parents down.

383
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:34,522
You're right.

384
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,624
We're gonna be here all night.

385
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,826
Bars.

386
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,861
Wait, I know.

387
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,697
We can multitask.

388
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:46,600
Let's rehearse our performance
while we finish Marky's work.

389
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,970
Come on, girl.

390
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:51,806
âª Rip and dip that hip âª

391
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,607
Okay.

392
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,909
âª Go, Lay Lay âª

393
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:56,344
âª Go, Lay Lay âª

394
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,712
âª Go, Sadie âª

395
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,113
âª Do the Say Say âª

396
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,849
âª Hey âª

397
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,150
âª Whoa, whoa âª

398
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,485
- Do a hip.
- Oh!

399
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:05,987
Get into it!

400
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:09,623
Is this fun
and frolicking I see?

401
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,059
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

402
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:13,983
no, no, no, no, no!

403
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,988
I want less "Happy Feet"
and more "Hard Knock Life."

404
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:22,670
You know what?
Forget this.

405
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:25,906
I'm going upstairs to get me
a drink and kick my feet up.

406
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,875
Do I need to tell
my parents your secret?

407
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,310
I wish you would.

408
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:33,147
Oh, I feel weird.

409
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,049
Something's happening.

410
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:40,121
Wow.

411
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,378
She's moving with super speed.

412
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,594
Well, that's a new one.

413
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,169
Whoa.
What was that?

414
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,470
Did I just...

415
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:57,872
Zip around the room
like Usain Bolt

416
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:58,973
strapped to a rocket ship?

417
00:16:59,057 --> 00:16:59,974
Yeah.

418
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,676
Yeah, you did.

419
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,544
You just found
a new avatar power.

420
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,280
It's like speeding up
a video on your phone.

421
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,949
Which is perfect,
because we have

422
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,684
so many more containers
to label.

423
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:11,018
Wait, did I say we?

424
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:13,588
Because I meant y'all.

425
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:15,649
Well, I guess this
will give us more time

426
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,424
to rehearse, since...

427
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:18,192
I can get this done quicker.

428
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,961
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

429
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:22,630
Let's go, Lay Lay,
clap, clap.

430
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,980
Super speed, invisibility,
freezing time?

431
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:41,682
With her avatar powers
and my business genius,

432
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,784
we're gonna take over
the world.

433
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,232
Thank you so much
for doing this.

434
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,268
It's just
a silly apology video,

435
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:01,836
and then tonight,
we'll be introduced

436
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,072
at the Cleveland Hall of Fame
Music Awards by Iggy Azalea.

437
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,841
Who was wrong.

438
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,243
Yeah.
See, I know you were right,

439
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,845
and you know you were right.

440
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,180
So what's it matter
if her millions of followers

441
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,483
think you were wrong?

442
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,640
I'm gonna need one more.

443
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,644
Please, baby, baby, please.

444
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:26,549
Ew, you're
somebody's parents.

445
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:29,196
Have you made your decision?

446
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,032
I have.

447
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:32,533
I'm doing this for you.

448
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,835
- For us.
- Whatever.

449
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,692
Hit record, little girl.

450
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,943
âª Ooh, my, my, I'm sorry âª

451
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:46,347
âª Ooh, my, my, I was wrong âª

452
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,550
âª Ooh, my, my,
your way was better âª

453
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:53,542
âª This is my apology song âª

454
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,658
Ooh, my, my.

455
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,960
We're going to break
the Internet.

456
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,263
And Iggy is gonna
introduce us tonight.

457
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:05,032
You know it.

458
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:08,002
'Kay, bye.

459
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:10,504
Thank you so much
for doing this for us.

460
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,273
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this.

461
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:15,109
Oh, you can apologize
better than that.

462
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:16,277
- What do you mean?
- Uh-huh.

463
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:17,445
- No.
- Ready?

464
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,612
No, serious...

465
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,181
Ready, five, six, seven,
eight.

466
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:23,517
âª Ooh, my, my, I'm sorry âª

467
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:26,839
âª Ooh, my, my, I was wrong âª

468
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:27,535
Yeah.

469
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,658
âª Ooh, my, my,
your way was better âª

470
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,124
âª This is my apology song âª

471
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:40,234
Babe, I forgot
to press Record.

472
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,337
Yeah.
One more.

473
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,539
Five, six, seven, eight.

474
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:49,076
âª Ooh, my, my, I'm sorry âª

475
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,179
âª Ooh, my, my, I was wrong âª

476
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:06,093
I moved so fast,
my brain got jiggled,

477
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:08,183
and I do not like jiggly brain.

478
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,265
Good job.
The first phase

479
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:14,235
of Operation Marky Gets Rich
is complete.

480
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:17,171
Whoa.

481
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:18,205
Lay Lay,
you're hiccupping again.

482
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,240
Are you Okay?

483
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:20,408
Oh yeah, I just...

484
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,744
Need a minute.

485
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:24,979
Hey, kids.

486
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:26,647
We got something to tell you.

487
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:29,750
We just booked Iggy Azalea.

488
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,719
Bars.

489
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:32,987
Good job, Mom.

490
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,323
You're not as lame
as Sadie says you are.

491
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:37,658
I never said that.

492
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:41,495
I said... I love you, Mommy.

493
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,031
Our 15 minutes of fame
just turned into 20.

494
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:45,900
Whoo!

495
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,001
Why are we running?

496
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,169
I'm too excited to walk.

497
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:51,005
Okay.

498
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:54,175
Your parents' night
is gonna be so amazing.

499
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,776
It's like a dream come true.

500
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,346
Speaking of dreams,
let's talk about my dreams...

501
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,614
Money!

502
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,785
Lay Lay, you're gonna use
your super speed powers

503
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,487
to get my samples
into every gift bag,

504
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,322
including Iggy's.

505
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:10,257
You're gonna
make us work more?

506
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:11,826
You're killing me, Marky.

507
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,461
I can't perform
after filling up

508
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,162
all those bags
with super speed.

509
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:18,332
I'm the queen of extra,
but that is too extra.

510
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,404
Oh, I don't feel good.

511
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,374
What are you doing?

512
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,375
Lay Lay Lay.

513
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,779
Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay.

514
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,280
Why do you keep
saying your name?

515
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,683
Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay.

516
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:36,784
Uh-oh.

517
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,519
"Lay Lay" is all she can say.

518
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:40,054
This isn't good.

519
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:41,021
Lay Lay Lay Lay.

520
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,089
Lay Lay.

521
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:43,224
What is wrong
with her, Sadie?

522
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:45,125
You had her doing too much.

523
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:47,294
Marky, you broke Lay Lay.

524
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,751
- Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay.
- Oh, this is bad.

525
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,086
This is bad.

526
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,187
- Lay Lay Lay Lay.
- I know.

527
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:58,221
You're glitching.

528
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:00,117
- Lay Lay Lay Lay.
- I know.

529
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:01,953
If we don't fix this,
it'll ruin my parents' night

530
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:03,421
and our chances
of performing in front

531
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,344
of era-era Iggy Azalea.

532
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:07,992
Lay Lay Lay Lay.

533
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,727
You're right.

534
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,164
Then my parents will find out
you're an avatar from my phone,

535
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,464
and they'll know
that we lied to them.

536
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,832
Then, they'll hand you
over to the government,

537
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,033
where you'll be plugged

538
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,435
into a giant supercomputer
in Nevada.

539
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,804
Oh, and then I'll never see
you, because my mom says

540
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,095
the desert makes her ashy,
and we won't go there.

541
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,910
You understood all that?

542
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:28,446
Of course, I did.
I'm her bestie.

543
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,814
Lay Lay.

544
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,250
Well, what about
my InstaShave plans?

545
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,851
Lay Lay!

546
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,220
I understood that one.

547
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,222
Hey, kids we were
so excited about Iggy,

548
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,057
I forgot to ask
if your song was ready.

549
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,993
We're good.
Great.

550
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,328
You don't not have
anything to worry about.

551
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,186
Sweet James Brown,
a double negative?

552
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:50,735
What's wrong?

553
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,171
Trish Showtime Alexander
will get you ready.

554
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,405
Trish?

555
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,095
We have a serious situation.

556
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:00,878
Jasmine's coming over.

557
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,413
She wants to hear our speech.

558
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,015
Oh, right.

559
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,783
We have to make a speech.

560
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,351
I was so focused
on getting Iggy on board,

561
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,854
I kind of did not
not think about it.

562
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:12,023
A double negative?
Mom, are you okay?

563
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:15,293
I'm not not fine.
Everybody, get off my back.

564
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:17,094
When you mother has
to speak in public,

565
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,830
she gets, uh,
a little freaked out.

566
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,531
But she's
Trish Showtime Alexander.

567
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:21,732
She's great at performing.

568
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,201
When she has
to sing or dance.

569
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,836
But when she has
to give a speech,

570
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,170
you get Trish
deer-in-the-headlights

571
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,060
Alexander.

572
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,175
See?

573
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,032
Roadkill.

574
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,247
This is our big night.

575
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,049
We can't look crazy
in front of our peers.

576
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,050
Or in front of Iggy.

577
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,086
Who is also our peer.

578
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,121
Lay Lay.

579
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:45,323
Lay Lay.

580
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,591
Lay Lay.

581
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,793
- What is happening?
- Lay Lay.

582
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:51,229
She's just saying,
âª Go, Trish âª

583
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:52,396
âª You got this âª

584
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,431
âª Go, Trish âª

585
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,665
âª You got this âª

586
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:55,700
âª Go, Trish âª

587
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:56,868
âª You got this âª

588
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:57,835
âª Go, Trish âª

589
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,270
âª You got this âª

590
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,438
Yes.

591
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,672
I can do this.

592
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,307
Whoo!

593
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:04,575
Now you're running?

594
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,012
Lay Lay fired me up.

595
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:09,614
We have to figure out
how to fix Lay Lay,

596
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,216
because this ain't okay-kay.

597
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,384
Lay Lay.

598
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:14,719
Oh, you're right.
That is bars.

599
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,260
Oh, what am I gonna do?

600
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:23,995
You know I can't speak
in front of people.

601
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,530
This is your fault.

602
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:27,798
How is it my fault?

603
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,367
When we got married,
it gave me license

604
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:32,937
to blame all
my irrational fears on you.

605
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,529
Listen, babe,
big daddy Bryce got you.

606
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,344
I learned a thing or two
about public speaking

607
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,580
when I was in the play
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."

608
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,814
Just get to the point, Bryce.

609
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:46,584
Okay.

610
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,120
Confidence is the key.

611
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:53,324
Now, pretend I'm the audience,
and confidently,

612
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,980
let me hear your speech.

613
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,332
Hi

614
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:09,106
Okay, uh, that could use
a little work.

615
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,875
Oh, I can't do it.

616
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,511
I can't speak in front
of all those people.

617
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,646
My mom's gonna think
I don't appreciate her.

618
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:19,083
Oh my gosh, it's Jasmine!

619
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:19,884
Relax.

620
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:20,985
Relax.

621
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,620
I'm gonna open the door.

622
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,221
You're gonna do your thing,

623
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:27,391
and Jasmine's gonna love it.

624
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:28,726
I got this.

625
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,361
I got this.

626
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,629
I got this.

627
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,130
Hi.

628
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:36,367
I'm so excited
to hear your speech.

629
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,290
And go.

630
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:42,528
Okay, do your thing.

631
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:48,479
Hi

632
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,250
Should I call the paramedics?

633
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,486
I know.
It needs work.

634
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,821
Okay?

635
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:59,156
Trish performs better
when there's a beat.

636
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,193
So what if she did it
like a spoken word,

637
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:04,028
and I'll accompany
with some bongos?

638
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,363
Okay.
Make that work.

639
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,198
Love you both.
Air kisses.

640
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:09,688
Bye.

641
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:15,206
I know you're nervous,
but two days

642
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,540
before the opening night
of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"

643
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:19,110
- we...
- Okay, bye.

644
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,619
Lay Lay.

645
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,588
I love it.
Thanks.

646
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,689
My hair looks fantastic.

647
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:32,923
Lay Lay.

648
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:35,026
Yeah, yeah, I know.

649
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,395
No one's hair
is as fly as yours.

650
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,498
Lay Lay.

651
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,699
I got it.

652
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,234
I know how to fix Lay Lay.

653
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:44,272
You do?

654
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,337
Lay Lay came from your phone.
Right?

655
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,472
So why don't we fix her
like a phone?

656
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,474
I called a cell phone repairman
from Nerd Knights

657
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,076
and told them my phone
was glitching.

658
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,310
They'll be right over.

659
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,079
Won't they be suspicious

660
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:56,714
when they see your phone
isn't broken?

661
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,115
That's why...

662
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,639
I put yours
in a pitcher of water.

663
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:03,587
Marky!

664
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:04,989
You'll thank me later.

665
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,058
Okay.

666
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,726
The Nerd Knight van
just pulled up.

667
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,027
You guys stay here and listen.

668
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:11,695
When he tells me
how to fix my phone,

669
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,831
I'll yell the instructions
to you, and you follow them.

670
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,066
Okay?

671
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,588
Sounds like a great plan.

672
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,270
Lay Lay.

673
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:21,360
Yep.
It's a totally stupid plan.

674
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:28,145
Hear ye, hear ye.

675
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,248
It is I, Sir Fix-A-Lot.

676
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:34,239
I like big ruts
and I cannot lie.

677
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,255
So what, pray tell, seems
to ail thee, me lord?

678
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:40,558
My good sir,
the phone keeps glitching.

679
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:42,626
Ah, the dreaded glitch.

680
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,297
Oh, how it lays low
the good townspeople.

681
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,165
Well, nary thee worry, me lord.

682
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,102
I can slay
this dragon of a problem.

683
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,970
Awesome.
What do we do?

684
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,805
Well, first,
we want to remove

685
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,240
all frivolous features

686
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:59,243
that could be slowing down
thy phone.

687
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,278
- Got it.
- Got it, yes.

688
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:03,669
I'll remove
everything frivolous!

689
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:05,983
Okay.

690
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:07,918
Let's get rid
of this stuff you don't need.

691
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:10,554
Lay Lay.

692
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,457
Got it.
Bling is not frivolous.

693
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:17,394
Well, also, sometimes,
thy phone can overheat.

694
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:23,701
Now, may I recommend
the fanning motion?

695
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,425
Shake the phone
to cool it down!

696
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,907
Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay Lay.

697
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,943
Lay Lay.

698
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:36,113
The final step,
the coup de grace,

699
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,749
would be to hold down
thy power button

700
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,485
to reset thy phone.

701
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,187
Hold down
the power button

702
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,222
to reset the phone!

703
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,190
Kid, are you okay,

704
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:48,726
or do you just like shouting?

705
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,927
Power button?

706
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,095
Where's your power button,
Lay Lay?

707
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,930
- Lay Lay.
- Okay.

708
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:53,964
Lay Lay.

709
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:54,965
Lay Lay.

710
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:56,033
Lay Lay.

711
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:57,101
Lay Lay.

712
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,569
Lay Lay.
Lay...

713
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:03,307
Once thy phone reboots,

714
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,676
it should function
in its normal capacity,

715
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,601
and verily, thou shall live
happily ever after.

716
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:11,982
Thanks, Sir Fix-A-Lot.

717
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,651
My pleasure, my lord.

718
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:19,657
I am off henceforth and whither
to the windows to the wall.

719
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:23,160
Exeunt with a flourish.

720
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:24,962
- It worked?
- I think so.

721
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,063
She's still rebooting.

722
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,464
We need a little more time.

723
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,466
<i>Kids, time to leave
for the CHoFMAs.</i>

724
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,690
Sadie, drop Lay Lay and run.

725
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,672
Marky, calm down.
I have an idea.

726
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,462
One second, Mom.

727
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,645
Is that the bongo
for my speech?

728
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,314
No.
This is the bongo for the luau

729
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:46,016
I'm going to after the show.

730
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,119
Let's leave
the sarcasm at home, huh?

731
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:51,810
Kids, we have to go.
We're gonna be late.

732
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,360
Ready for the CHoFMAs.

733
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,517
Oh, Bryce,
let me fix your collar.

734
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,076
Ready?
It's time to go.

735
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,143
The driver's here.

736
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:14,345
You got us a driver?

737
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,046
No.
It's me.

738
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,182
I'm the driver.

739
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,117
Let's go, kids.

740
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,952
Right behind you.

741
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,088
Hey, this girl's bling
is heavy.

742
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:26,578
How does she hold herself up?

743
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,648
I hope she reboots soon.

744
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,850
It's almost showtime.

745
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,020
Whoa.
Something's happening.

746
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,287
Do you think
the reboot worked?

747
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,257
Lay Lay?

748
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,227
It did not.

749
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,651
That Sir Fix-A-Lot
is getting one star.

750
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,768
Fake it till you make it.

751
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,503
Fake it till you make it.

752
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,005
Tonight, we own the world.

753
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,841
Or at least
downtown Cleveland.

754
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:01,976
Oh, hey, kids.

755
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,912
Hey...

756
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,769
Come over here for a sec.

757
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,583
Look at this place.

758
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,352
In just an hour,
it's gonna be filled

759
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,888
with hundreds of people.

760
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,382
You got your hands full,
bongo boy.

761
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,330
Hi, guys.

762
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,232
Hi, Jasmine.

763
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,300
Where's Iggy?

764
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,735
Funny story.

765
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,004
Not in a ha-ha way,
more like a,

766
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,528
"Ooh, that's completely ruined
your night" kind of way.

767
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,043
Jasmine, you don't want
to play with me right now.

768
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,579
Cut to the chase.

769
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,047
All right.

770
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,050
Iggy was dropping a puck
at a big hockey game in Calgary

771
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,885
and got snowed in.

772
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,020
She can't make it to the show.

773
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,721
What?

774
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:52,481
She's really sorry,
like super-duper sorry.

775
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,562
What are we supposed to do?

776
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,963
This is our parents' big night.

777
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,865
Lay Lay!

778
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,033
That's right, Lay Lay.

779
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,736
You're going to get
to perform, too.

780
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,172
If it's any consolation,
Iggy said

781
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,440
I should introduce you guys.

782
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,275
How is that consolation?

783
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,511
We told everyone that she
was gonna introduce us.

784
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,214
We're gonna look like fools.

785
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:17,318
Guys, this is not
the end of the world.

786
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:21,589
Trish, you and I are
still getting a CHoFMA,

787
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,991
and I know you're gonna rock
that speech.

788
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,460
- Am I?
- Yeah.

789
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,729
Of course, I am,
because I've been waiting

790
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,031
for this moment
my entire career,

791
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,502
and my mama didn't raise
no coward.

792
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:35,836
Sadie and Lay Lay,

793
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,172
I know you're gonna electrify
this crowd.

794
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,440
- Lay Lay!
- Hey!

795
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,541
That's the spirit!

796
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,877
They're gonna chant
your name.

797
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,878
That's right.

798
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,813
Lay Lay and I are ready.

799
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,182
I hope.

800
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,553
Guys, we're Alexanders.

801
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,488
I know this isn't exactly
how we planned it,

802
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,192
but it's still gonna be
a magical night.

803
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,460
You're right, Dad.

804
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,195
This is going to be
a magical night.

805
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,130
Don't mess it up.

806
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,233
I wasn't done yet.

807
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,502
It's gonna be a magical night

808
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,273
because I get
to be on stage with my family.

809
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,463
There's nothing
better than that.

810
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,977
We got this.

811
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,281
Alexanders on three.

812
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,682
You're introducing us.

813
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,850
Get in here, too.

814
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,819
Yay, I'm so excited.

815
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,621
One, two, three.

816
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,024
- Alexanders!
- Lay Lay!

817
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,197
Lay Lay, I wish you could
say something other than...

818
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,065
- Lay Lay.
- Yup.

819
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,922
That's the one.

820
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,140
Sweet James Brown,
we've struck the mother lode.

821
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,741
It's all the swag bags.

822
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,677
Lay Lay, I'm gonna need you
to use

823
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,512
your super speed powers
to get these samples

824
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,780
into those gift bags.

825
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,791
Whew.

826
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,180
She did it.

827
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,970
Why are Lay Lay's hands
shooting fireworks?

828
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,540
That's just the magic
of the scheme coming together.

829
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,408
Lay Lay, you're amazing.

830
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,212
No, girl.

831
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,169
You're amazing.

832
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,517
Lay Lay, you said
something other than "Lay Lay."

833
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,187
You got this.

834
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,655
Oh, no.

835
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,023
Those were Lay Lay's
default phrases

836
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,558
when she was in my phone.

837
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,726
When we reset her,
she must have went back

838
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,927
to factory mode.

839
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,296
Are you there?
Lay Lay, it's me, Sadie.

840
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,631
Hi. I'm Lay Lay.

841
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,832
- What's your name?
- What?

842
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,866
No.

843
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,900
You know me.

844
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,968
Nice to meet you, Nome.

845
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,837
I'm Lay Lay.

846
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,739
Oh, no.
Marky, this is not good.

847
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,007
She doesn't know who I am.

848
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,142
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to break her.

849
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,266
Whatever you say, superstar.

850
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,413
She's gone.

851
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,016
My best friend is gone.

852
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,319
When life gets you down,
turn that frown upside down.

853
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,754
You actually paid

854
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,656
for an app that talks
like this?

855
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,291
Marky, you don't understand.

856
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,659
Lay Lay helped me
with my confidence.

857
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,627
She helped me come out
of my shell.

858
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,629
She's like the sister
I never had.

859
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,532
Get your boot-scooting booty
on down to the Boot Barn,

860
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,701
where we've got
the best prices in town.

861
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,970
Yee-haw.

862
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,405
Is that a commercial?

863
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,029
You didn't even get
the ad-free version?

864
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,679
It wouldn't have been
financially responsible.

865
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,281
Ain't nothing to it
but to do it, girl.

866
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,350
<i>Welcome
to the Cleveland Hall of Fame</i>

867
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,085
<i>Music Awards.</i>

868
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,854
Oh, this is bad.

869
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,190
We have to go on stage soon,
and everyone will find out

870
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,358
Lay Lay's secret.

871
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,726
Maybe no one will notice

872
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,461
something's off about Lay Lay?

873
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,762
<i>Hola, amigos,</i>

874
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,864
<i>y vamos el Boots Barn.</i>

875
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,588
Yee-haw.

876
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,291
Yeah.
Someone's gonna notice.

877
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,166
Lay Lay, please, hear me.

878
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,635
You're a real teenage girl now.

879
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,802
You're not the avatar

880
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,437
for my positive affirmation
app.

881
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:08,007
A smile goes with any outfit.

882
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:11,210
Look at her.

883
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,545
My best friend is broken.

884
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,215
Without her, I'm lost.

885
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,383
I'm sorry.

886
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,784
I feel horrible.

887
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:20,886
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

888
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,224
You trusted me with a secret,
and I took advantage.

889
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,248
I swear, I would do anything
to get Lay Lay back.

890
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:33,399
Wow, Marky, that's
really nice of you to say.

891
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,867
Of course, now,
it doesn't matter,

892
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,025
because you destroyed
my best friend, but thanks.

893
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:42,307
<i>And now,
let's get the CHoFMAs going</i>

894
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:47,112
<i>with the presentation
of Jingle Writers of the Year.</i>

895
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:48,113
Hi.

896
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:49,815
I'm Jasmine.

897
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,717
In just a minute,
you'll get to hear Trish

898
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:53,052
<i>and Bryce's daughter Sadie</i>

899
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:55,788
and her friend Lay Lay
debut a new song.

900
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:58,490
But first, give it up
for the advertising

901
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:01,493
songwriters of the year,
Bryce and Trish Alexander.

902
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:04,763
Marky, we need to figure out

903
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,098
what we're gonna do
with Lay Lay.

904
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,332
She's still broken.

905
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,034
Boom.
That's what I'm talking about.

906
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,970
Girl power.

907
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:13,505
Oh, man.

908
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:15,741
Lay Lay and I are supposed
to perform next, but if we do,

909
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,843
someone will figure out Lay Lay
is an avatar from my phone,

910
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:19,278
and then the men in black
will show up,

911
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,679
and they'll do that thing
where they just stare at you

912
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,114
until you start talking.

913
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,716
And if you don't talk, they'll
offer you a stick of gum

914
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,050
and stare at you
until you do talk.

915
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,752
And then, they'll take away
my best friend,

916
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:28,153
and all I'll have left
is a stick of gum.

917
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,888
And it'll be winter mint,
which everyone knows

918
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:32,791
is the worst flavor of gum,
because it burns your tongue.

919
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,694
I'm going to be friendless
with a burning tongue.

920
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:40,299
You've got this, babe.

921
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,601
Remember, confidence.

922
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:45,237
Get your Badu on.

923
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:53,278
Wow.

924
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:55,280
Dreams really do come true.

925
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:58,016
Like the sky that is blue,
pride runs from my head

926
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,184
to my feet.

927
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:04,890
Thank my mama
for believing in me.

928
00:38:04,974 --> 00:38:09,228
Mama, I took pride in my work,
like you said I could,

929
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:13,732
and now your little girl did it
like you said I should.

930
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:16,735
Wait.

931
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,036
I have to thank
one more person.

932
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,872
Okay, then.

933
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,640
I'd like to think
my kindergarten teacher,

934
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,208
Mrs. Kreider.

935
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:27,146
Oh, and my first grade teacher,
Mrs. Weldon.

936
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,148
I got her through
the stage fright.

937
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,382
I'm that good.

938
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:31,416
Yeah.

939
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,851
Is she ever gonna stop?

940
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,919
No.

941
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:36,822
She's on one.

942
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:39,625
And to Nelly Sal win,
that girl in seventh grade,

943
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:43,962
I have some words for you.

944
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:45,130
Sorry.

945
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:47,800
Rest in peace, Nelly.

946
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,502
They're about
to put you guys on stage.

947
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:51,904
Lay Lay, if you
can hear me in there,

948
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:54,540
please know I loved having
you be a part of my life.

949
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,109
You were the best bestie
anyone could ask for.

950
00:38:57,193 --> 00:39:01,680
If you don't try,
you'll always wonder why.

951
00:39:01,764 --> 00:39:02,948
Ah, ever since
those stupid hiccups,

952
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:04,483
she just hasn't been Lay Lay.

953
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:05,584
That's it.

954
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:07,219
Maybe if we cure the hiccups,

955
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,654
it will cure the glitch.

956
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:10,055
Okay, but how?

957
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,456
When someone has
the hiccups,

958
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,025
you have to scare them,
like this.

959
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,663
Go big or go home.

960
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:19,498
That's not
how you scare Lay Lay.

961
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:22,100
This is how you scare Lay Lay.

962
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:25,170
Girl, your shoes
don't match your jacket.

963
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:28,473
The best way
to look good is to feel good.

964
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:29,675
Oh, no.

965
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,943
If hearing her outfit is wack

966
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:32,110
didn't scare her out of it,

967
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,045
nothing will.

968
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,302
No, there is another way.

969
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:41,019
Get your boot-scooting
booty on down...

970
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:43,121
Skip ad.

971
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:45,157
What are you doing
with that InstaShave?

972
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:47,059
Ah!

973
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:50,929
Ah!

974
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,497
What happened
to your eyebrows?

975
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:56,223
Marky, your forehead so big,
now it's a five-head.

976
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,538
That was snark.

977
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:00,739
You're snarky again.

978
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:03,308
Lay Lay's back.

979
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:04,643
I missed you so much.

980
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:05,677
I missed you, too.

981
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:07,012
I felt so weird.

982
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:09,715
It's like I was me,
but I wasn't me.

983
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:12,551
Lay Lay, I'm sorry
I overused your powers.

984
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:13,919
I won't do it again.

985
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:15,187
I love having you around.

986
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:18,590
From now on,
your secret is safe with me.

987
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:21,193
Thanks, Marky.
That means a lot.

988
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:24,396
I'm sorry. I can't.

989
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,219
Your face.

990
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,267
Right?

991
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:29,768
We should, like, project
a movie

992
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:32,738
on his forehead or something.

993
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:34,640
Okay, okay.
Laugh it up.

994
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,476
My eyebrows will grow back in...

995
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,012
Four to six months?

996
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,014
What?

997
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:43,148
You know what?

998
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,883
Normally, I wouldn't leave
the house

999
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,985
without my eyebrow
pencil, but right now,

1000
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,353
all I have is this marker.

1001
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:51,690
So make it work and fast.

1002
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:55,694
Thank you.
Thank you.

1003
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:58,297
Who got a CHoFMA?
Trish got a CHoFMA.

1004
00:40:58,381 --> 00:40:59,665
Who got a CHoFMA?

1005
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,166
Trish got a CHoFMA.

1006
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,335
Who got a CHoFMA?
Trish got a CHoFMA.

1007
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,270
Who got a CHoFMA?

1008
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:07,973
Trish got a CHoFMA.

1009
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:10,442
And to all the haters who said
it wouldn't happen, uh,

1010
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:12,933
new phone, who dis?

1011
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:16,448
Thank you,
and remember to compost.

1012
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,923
And now, my creative partner
and the man I love

1013
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,825
would like to say something.

1014
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:31,730
Watch big daddy Bryce
bring it home.

1015
00:41:31,814 --> 00:41:33,298
I want to thank my...

1016
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:39,404
My husband would like
to thank his mama.

1017
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:41,106
Thank you, and good night.

1018
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,341
So many people.

1019
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:47,879
You ready to go out there
and kill it, Lay Lay?

1020
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,914
Let's do this, Sadie.

1021
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:52,217
It's slay time.

1022
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,354
Let's hear it for Trish
and Bryce Alexander.

1023
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,326
And to show how deep

âª So I'ma work hard every

00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:26,184
âª It don't matter

1033
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,854
âª If you got big goals,
then you got to be brave âª

1034
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:30,589

1040
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:43,435

in achieving dreams âª

1043
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,475

00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,946
âª I'ma be whatever
I want to be âª

1047
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,816
âª You can do it, as long
as you got a dream âª

1048
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,184
âª If I dream it,
I believe it âª

1049
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:00,585

1050
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:01,820

00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:03,288
âª I'ma be it âª

00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,790
âª If I dream it,
I believe it, I'ma be it âª

1053
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:05,957
- âª I'ma be it âª
- âª I'ma be it âª

1054
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,592
âª I'ma be it âª

1055
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:19,538
- We love you, Cleveland.
- Yes.

1056
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:23,608
Let's give it up one more time
for Trish and Bryce Alexander.

1057
00:43:28,297 --> 00:43:30,503
Where's Marky?
He should be out here too.

1058
00:43:34,303 --> 00:43:36,388
Boy, what did you do
to your eyebrows?

1059
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,712
InstaShave
and a can-do attitude.

1060
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,199
Smile and wave, Marky.

1061
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:42,535
Smile and wave.

1062
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:52,094
Fashion is very, very,
very important to me.

1063
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,831
It is the way that
I keep my confidence up.

1064
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,234
I like to be done up for sure,
but like if

1065
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:01,106
you see me in the airport,
joggers, hoodies...

1066
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,659
Y'know, I got some
cute stuff in here.

1067
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,248
So it's really just my comfort.

1068
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:06,883
I feel comfortable when
I wear clothes like that.

1069
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:07,884
We're gonna go with that.

1070
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:09,919
I wanna pick it out.

1071
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:11,888
- Let's go red.
- Red?

1072
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:14,290
I have to wear something that
makes me happy.

1073
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:16,414
And that's life
with That Girl Lay Lay.

1074
