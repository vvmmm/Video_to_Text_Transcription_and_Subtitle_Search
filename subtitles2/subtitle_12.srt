Where did you find this notation?

We found it in...

7
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
- It was in Master Kedar's music notebook.
- Yes.

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
We got it from there.

Kedar's music notebook?

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,200
But he's not supposed to know it.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
This is an ancient system of notation.

Don't expect any help from me

No...

Why would we lie to you?

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,720
I found it in Master Kedar's notebook...

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,240
But I don't know
how he knew about it.

17
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,960
Hmm.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,240
It'll be a big help
if you could explain this notation.

Do you sing classical music

You're good with words.

But are you equally good with the ragas?

30

You can put it to test.

31

Sir...

my mother had taught me something.

63
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,520
The seven notes of music...

64
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,360
symbolise the seven gods
and goddesses.

65
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Does that mean that they define
the seven moods as well?

66
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,880
Correct.

67
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,320
It's mentioned in ancient texts
on music.

68
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
That's why they demonstrated it
through dance postures.

69
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,320
"Sa" symbolises limitless, infinity.

70
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,200
"Re" symbolises sadness and sorrow.

71
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,600
"Ga" symbolises peace and calm.

72
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,760
"Ma" symbolises the sexual and erotic.

73
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,920
"Pa" symbolises happiness and joy.

74
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,040
"Dha" symbolises irritation and disgust.

75
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,520
"Ni" symbolises the serene and tranquil.

76
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
That means...

77
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,320
each note symbolises
a specific mood pattern.

78
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Exactly!

79
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,360

Sir...

82
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,000
I have one last question.

83
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
What?

84
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120

it was composed by Amanat Khan.

After all this effort we get to know
that it's Raga Jog?

103
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,520
Where is Raga Sanjivani?

104
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
In his riddle, Amanat Khan wrote...

105
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,119
"In the heart of Rudrapur
lies a Shiva lake.

106
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,440
When the discs are aligned

107
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,639
And the notes are played
at twice the pace of time

108
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,840
Raga Sanjivani you shall find."

109
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Each disc has an instrument painted on it
along with the notations.

110
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,720
So if each instrument is played
according to its notation

111
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
we'll get to know the "bandish"
of Raga Sanjivani?

112
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,359
I don't think so.

Finding the Raga Sanjivani
won't help crack the entire mystery.

115

The game isn't over yet.

116
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,840
But Naad ran away with the discs.

117
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,720
What if they decode the notation?
They'll find Raga Sanjivani!

118

What do you mean?

127
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,560
Amanat Khan popularised
a particular style of music.

128
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,640
It later became the specialty
of the Anandagarh School of Music.

129
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,600
Master learned it and taught it to us.

130
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,080
You mean it has to be played
in the Anandagarh style?

131
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,520
Hmm.

132
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,000
- Seems that way.
- Hmm.

133
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:23,120
With a combination
of "shruti", "meer" and "gamak"

134
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
we can play a special style of music.

135
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,200
No other musicians can play it.

136
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,920
Then go on.

137
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
You're the best person for it.

What about the others?

143
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
We need them too.

144
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Mom learned the santoor
from Salamat Uncle.

145
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,480
And Noor Aunty taught Saaz
the shehnai.

146
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,040
But do they know the specific style
of the Anandagarh School of Music?

147
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,120
Look...

148
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
Both Salamat Uncle and Noor Aunty
are disciples of Mustafa Hussain.

149
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,640
And Mustafa Hussain and Kedar Mishra
are disciples of Amanat Khan.

150
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Hence...

151
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,639
They all belong
to Anandagarh School of Music.

152

00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
What?

165
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,720
What are you saying?

166
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
O... Okay.

167
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
- What happened?
- Hey...

168
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,200
Naad has kidnapped Saaz.

169
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,560
What!

170
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,000
What do we do now?

171
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Come along.

172
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
Fast!

173
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
Hurry up, Shruti.

174
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Get in the car.

175
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
- Alap!
- Shruti, come!

176
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,520
Shut up and get into the car.

177
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey!

178
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
Get in.
Fast!

179
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
Into the car.

180
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,720
Get in!

181
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,720
Naad.

182
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,120
You can't harm them.

183
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Can't you hear me?

184
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Get in.

185
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Do it!

186
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Naad!

187
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,640
Come with me.

188
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Call the ambulance.
Fast!

189
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,000
They... won't get here in time.

190
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
Before I die...

191
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,840
let me tell you something.

192
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,480
I...

193
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,760
I was a fan of Raunak Bai.

194
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,800
Naad was after her.

195
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:31,120
I waned to save her and her son.

196
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,720
I had tried my best.

197
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,320
I wanted to do one good deed in life.

198
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,720
From whom did you want
to save me and Mom?

199
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,400
Mobile...

200
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,320
On my mobile phone...

201
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,560
there are some DNA test reports.

202
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,320
I've not shown one particular report
to anyone.

203
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,960
Not even to Rudrabhairav.

204
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,120
Instead...

205
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,960
I'd shown him a fake report.

206
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,720
If you see it...

206
00:18:26,305 --> 00:19:26,211
