00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,962
All righty,

3
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,256
we are here in the airport,
getting ready to leave.

4
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,507
Right by the duty-free shop

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,509
as you can see good things
there you can get.

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,137
Lookie who I found
sitting right here.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,847
- Hello there, Gina.
- Hello there.

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,450
All right, well, hey,
we will see around

9
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,142
as we continue
the adventure here

10
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,311
for Anarchapulco 2018.

11
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,112
We're taking a trip to Mexico,
I'm really excited.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm not so much of an anarchist.

13
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,074
I don't even like that word,
per se.

14
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,286
A G4.

15
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,342
We are here...

16
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,636
- Anarchapulco, ready to go!
- So, we did it!

17
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,514
I finally made it! Oh!

18
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,227
Look at that.

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,896
That's just the parking lot.

20
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,816
It's hotter than damn
donut grease here right now.

21
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,447
So, I'm sitting
there at the computer

22
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,291
and I'm trying to find a flight
for somebody,

23
00:01:56,324 --> 00:02:00,537
and like there's no flights
available to Acapulco.

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,163
There's 20 flights a day.

25
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,791
There should be hundreds
of seats available.

26
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:09,462
And then I was like,
"Oh shit, that's us!"

27
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,883
- Oh, my God...
- These are all anarchists.

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,345
Like every fucking seat
on every plane,

29
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,264
Anarchapulco, all booked out.

30
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,478
That's badass, man.

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,869
- Nathan!
- Hey, Lee Ann.

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,829
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

33
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,123
Insane.

34
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,793
I had been
following this community

35
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,170
for about two years
at this point,

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,131
and the sudden burst
of the crypto markets

37
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,050
was, by far, the most
pivotal thing to happen yet.

38
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,057
The next conference
was happening

39
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,227
just two months after
Bitcoin's 20,000-dollar peak.

40
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,195
And with that,
the rest of the world wanted in.

41
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,199
And the anarchists?
They wanted more.

42
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,661
Most of our people
were buying into Bit coin

43
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,247
at like, 30 dollars, 50 dollars,
100 dollars.

44
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,791
It went to 20,000 dollars
that year, so all of a sudden,

45
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,793
like, most people had
a lot of money.

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,229
I mean,
everyone was coming in on

47
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,130
private jets and yachts.

48
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,214
Everything was sold out,

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,216
the whole place was packed
with people.

50
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,057
How are you feeling right now?

51
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,729
Uh, we, technically,
we haven't really even started,

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,606
and I'm already exhausted.

53
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,567
But I'm feeling pretty good,
like, I'm excited

54
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,195
and it's going to be,
in the words that I've used

55
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,864
to describe it to the team,
"Fucking Epic!"

56
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,461
What's up, Anarchapulco?

57
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,769
There was an idea

58
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,441
to bring together
a group of remarkable people

59
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,863
to see if we could
become something more.

60
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,157
In time,

61
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,994
the state will know
what it's like to lose.

62
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,191
Welcome to Anarchapulco.

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,864
The state
as a whole, as an institution

64
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,533
functions down to the detail

65
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,453
the way toxic narcissists
function.

66
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,163
Can I see a quick show of hands,

67
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,498
who here paid
for their attendance here

68
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,875
in cryptocurrency?

69
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,358
Get all your friends and family
and everybody else around you

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,756
using, uh, Bit coin Cash, Dash,
Ethereum, take your pick, uh...

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,257
They're all wonderful
at this point.

72
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,593
For me,
this started with parenting.

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,553
Anarchist-type of parenting

74
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,971
is what I want to share
with you.

75
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,265
And we're not going away.

76
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,768
You can't stop a good idea.

77
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,104
Jeff Berwick,
the Dollar Vigilante is with us.

78
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,188
Hello, guys.

79
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,356
This is a huge event.

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,901
I mean, it, it went
from large last year

81
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,861
to now, what? 1,700 people?

82
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,362
I keep hearing the number go up.

83
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,990
Uh, I think it's somewhere
between 14 and 1,700...

84
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201
- Yeah.
- Something like that.

85
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,620
Our audience became broader.

86
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,749
Usually, there's a lot more men,
and bachelor men,

87
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,084
you know, and like five women.

88
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,752
And they're just like...

89
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,961
You know, like...

90
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,173
It really makes women
not want to go.

91
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,966
And so we started workshops
for women,

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,594
so we could get them
to feel more comfortable.

93
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,100
I invite you
to come forward, yeah?

94
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,935
Come forward, stand up.

95
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,074
Shamanism and energy work
is an important aspect of,

96
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,784
you know, the anarchy movement.

97
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,581
The thing is that
it's super male,

98
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,208
it's a lot of male energy.

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,378
It definitely needs
the other aspect of it,

100
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,380
the heart, creativity,

101
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,382
and an intuition
kind of balancing it.

102
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,219
We started to get
more attendees that were women.

103
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,347
Workshops were full.
Everything was full.

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,313
Hey, hey, we're here at
Anarchapulco

105
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,816
with the bit coin.com.
Hey!

106
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,402
Tons of energy, cameras,

107
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,238
you know, interviews happening
all over the place.

108
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,341
But, yeah, this has got...
Definitely taken on a life

109
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,634
of its own now,
and it's a very...

110
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,369
We have public data
and then we have private data.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,627
Our conference had
a lot more sponsorship.

112
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
It's never been easier to reap

113
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,298
the rewards
of cryptocurrency mining.

114
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,465
Like Bit Club.

115
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,259
I've been blessed to be able
to come back,

116
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,611
year after year and speak
and talk

117
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,220
about all the cool projects
we're doing.

118
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,641
We had a lot of big names.

119
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,436
We've got motherfucking
Ron Paul in the house.

120
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,956
If you become aware
of these things,

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,649
then you have a moral obligation
to do something about it,

122
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,276
and that is to spread a message.

123
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,652
So, we just realized.

124
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,865
Wu-Tang Clan is here
to learn about crypto

125
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,284
and they're gonna
perform tonight.

126
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,051
The energy was so overwhelming,

127
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,302
in a positive way.

128
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,514
It was a paradise for anarchists
and freedom lovers.

129
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,353
During Anarchapulco that year,

130
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,272
I felt like a fish
out of water, I hated it.

131
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,659
"Oh, look, we're gonna
take over this hotel

132
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,910
as anarchists."

133
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,638
Like, "Look at how big we are,
look at how big we are",

134
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,662
look at how big we are!"

135
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,459
Everybody was cocky as hell.

136
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,548
Everybody had
extra money to burn,

137
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,715
so they were burning it.

138
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,596
We were all high
on crypto, right?

139
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,807
And so, everybody
was feeling like a baller,

140
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,226
money was moving around,
it was a big party.

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,396
They're all like,
"I'm fucking gods,"

142
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,440
- you know, "We're the shit!
- We're all the shit!"

143
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,825
Most people are
at the weird vibe beach party.

144
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,957
I don't wanna be immersed
in this vibe

145
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,334
because Anarchapulco
is just getting more of that,

146
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,752
like, you know,

147
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,422
"Let's be rock stars"
type of thing.

148
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,008
It was almost like
a reinforcement of like,

149
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,592
this is why I'm doing the Fork.

150
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,596
If Anarchapulco becomes

151
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,682
about being on vacation
with people

152
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,350
that call themselves anarchists,

153
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,229
we'll lose the whole idea
that it was born around.

154
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,316
John and Lily
scheduled Anarchaforko

155
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,986
to happen just one week
after Anarchapulco.

156
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,905
The conferences
weren't affiliated in any way,

157
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,240
so the success of the Fork

158
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,285
hinged entirely on their ability
to promote it themselves.

159
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,039
I was just so exhausted.

160
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,917
Socializing and getting people
excited about Anarchaforko.

161
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,504
We did not attend
any speakers this year,

162
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,798
yeah, we had too much to do,
managing our lives

163
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,177
and getting ready for the Fork
during the daylight hours.

164
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,700
Most of the time
we were getting here

165
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,598
just as the sun was going down
and were almost here

166
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,801
until the sun was coming up.

167
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,813
I literally disassociated

168
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,733
my way
through that entire conference.

169
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:56,405
And then, like, Paul was trying
to be a little mini kingpin.

170
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,455
Selling cocaine at Anarchapulco.

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,376
I don't know where Paul found
that source, honestly,

172
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,504
but he had the source
before he moved in with us.

173
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,927
We though he could be
stealthy enough, you know?

174
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,970
So, we had him selling
our edibles too.

175
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,765
So, like, the idea was,
he was going to get

176
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,393
people's contact information
and meet them places,

177
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,104
and like do it real
decentralized, like,

178
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,606
and try to not even do
the drug sales

179
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,858
on the property
of The Princess if he could.

180
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,821
But Paul couldn't do anything
with subtleness

181
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,199
that wasn't in his vocabulary.

182
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,952
He went to the venue, and like

183
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,664
he set up shop
in some dude's room.

184
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,678
He had all the party favors.

185
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,597
He got his hands on everything
and was distributing

186
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,808
to everybody to make sure
everyone had a good time.

187
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,816
Everybody was like, "Have you
tried Paul's cocaine yet?"

188
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,377
Like, I'd be talking
about the conference

189
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,195
and people would be like,
"Have you tried Paul's cocaineâ"

190
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,657
Paul even posted flyers
for his services on Facebook,

191
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,161
using an alias account
he created under his alter ego.

192
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,871
"Shepard Spook."

193
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,207
We told him
it was a stupid idea,

194
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,334
but we couldn't do
anything about it.

195
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,254
He was so obvious,
everybody knows who he was.

196
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,801
He was up
for days on end, using.

197
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,138
He wasn't necessarily grounded
to reality.

198
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,727
John and Lily invited us
up to the room

199
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,061
where Paul was working.

200
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,276
But they insisted we absolutely
could not film anything.

201
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,291
He would set up a table,
like, with his wares

202
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,628
wait for people to knock
on the door

203
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,881
and come in
and order their drugs,

204
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,633
sometimes do them.

205
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,571
It's almost like, dude, you're not
even supposed to be staying there,

206
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,721
like, you don't stay there.

207
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,557
You're supposed to leave
with the drugs

208
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,186
and go somewhere off site,
like, that's Drug Dealing 101.

209
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,396
Lily told us repeatedly

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,107
that, although, Paul was selling
cannabis products for them,

211
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,610
he was selling cocaine
purely on his own.

212
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,155
But they all seemed
to be taking a huge risk.

213
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,204
Paul started getting
into straight-up

214
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,707
like chases and stuff
with their security team,

215
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,431
'cause they were trying
to get rid of him.

216
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,255
Because he was our roommate,

217
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,923
he would come up
and he'd talk to us,

218
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,883
so the security started
watching us too.

219
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,093
And it was just like

220
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,223
this is not okay.
Not okay at all. We were pissed.

221
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,273
When you run a conference
in Acapulco,

222
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,234
when you have a lot of Americans
showing up

223
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,902
to a touristy place

224
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,281
they're gonna want to party.

225
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,993
And so,
we got to know the people

226
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,869
that would supply
our conference.

227
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:39,003
Nathan received a phone call
from our supplier.

228
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,088
He said that there are gringos

229
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,882
in a hotel room selling cocaine,

230
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,636
and "We're coming in,
they're done."

231
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,473
Nathan said, "Can you please
not do that at the conference?"

232
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Let me go talk to them."

233
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,810
Nathan told them,
you need to stop

234
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,688
or there's going
to be serious consequences.

235
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,818
They stopped,

236
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,822
so we didn't end up having
a shootout at the conference.

237
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,783
Kym and I went in that room.

238
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,578
So... so... you...
You... you can contest to

239
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,330
that they were selling drugs,
right?

240
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,933
We don't know. We were there, they
invited us, - You... but you knew...

241
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,420
But my memory was John and Lily
were just hanging out in there

242
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,965
and they were doing
some drugs. Um...

243
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,010
- As far as selling...
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,638
I didn't see them
actually doing anything.

245
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,556
Well, that's the best part.

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,850
The people in charge
don't do the stuff.

247
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,077
They have somebody else do it,

248
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,520
so then they're
never doing anything. Yeah.

249
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,698
Did you pay me
for the ICO thing?

250
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,831
Well, well, he's going on now.

251
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,667
But he wasn't here,
so, we had to break.

252
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,377
What?

253
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,003
- Jeff...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,607
- please take your seats, we're about to begin..
- Wait, hang on,

255
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,008
- the final extravaganza...
- where's this going?

256
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,053
Of Anarchapulco 2018.

257
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,265
Coco, Kolo, come here, Randall.

258
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,726
We're sits. A lot of sits.

259
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,106
Jedi, sits. Okay, go.

260
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,572
So, um

261
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,535
there's an article
that just came out today.

262
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,246
In it, he called me a, "Recluse",

263
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,082
watching the conference
on live stream

264
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,918
from his mansion in the hills,"
is what he said.

265
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,254
And I laughed at it first
because it sounded like crazy,

266
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,047
like I'm Howard Hughes
or something.

267
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,634
But then I thought about it,
I'm like,

268
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,153
"Well, that's actually
what I'm doing,

269
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,263
so, am I a recluse?
Is that what I am?"

270
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,389
I don't know.

271
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,867
I've actually been
a little depressed

272
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,935
the last couple of days.

273
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,271
Like, there must be a reason
I feel that way, right?

274
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,607
Now I have to think about that,
why do I... why do I feel so alone

275
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,484
when I'm surrounded
by so many people?

276
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,404
And I've realized, a lot of them
stem from my childhood.

277
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,451
I blocked out a lot
of my childhood.

278
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,413
I don't really remember a lot.

279
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,459
I had no friends, really.
I was a computer nerd,

280
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,502
I was always getting beat up
at school.

281
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,298
And my dad said maybe 30 words
to me my whole life,

282
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,675
and it was usually "Shut up."

283
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,096
I was just like, you know,
15, 16. And all of a sudden

284
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,682
I actually got all this anger
inside of me.

285
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,644
I learned how to ignore
all my emotions.

286
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,109
I'm going through
so many changes,

287
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,444
and so, this is like...

288
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,740
You know, I'm not drinking
at this conference, and, uh

289
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,825
without the alcohol,

290
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,149
I just don't want to be around
people and talk to people.

291
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,998
His closing words
for this conference

292
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:06,043
are about to come,
listen to this

293
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,504
as we welcome, Jeff Berwick!

294
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,823
Nathan learned very quickly

295
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,367
that Berwick wasn't somebody
he could rely on,

296
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,745
and he became a babysitter.

297
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,081
Basically, Nathan did everything

298
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,166
and Berwick really,
once in a while

299
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,710
would say, "How are things?"

300
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,629
So we're at the end
of Cryptopulco here

301
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,440
I've actually been watching
most of the speeches

302
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,674
all throughout Anarchapulco...

303
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,134
With Nathan,
you could see he really believed

304
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,498
in what he was doing
and he cared

305
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,390
about trying to organize
a thousand things at once

306
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,560
doing a million things that really
shouldn't have had to be his job.

307
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,854
Instead of going,
"That isn't my job,"

308
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,981
which almost
anybody else would've

309
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,025
because he so much believed
in the underlying goal.

310
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,653
I knew I could do it.

311
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,864
Nathan was getting exhausted.

312
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,869
It started to get on the family
because he's absent,

313
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,163
completely absent from the kids.

314
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,958
Ira Belle was a baby,

315
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,587
so I was in a different
stress-level mode for sure.

316
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,133
It just became more
and more clear

317
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,094
how much the conference
affected us, personally.

318
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,847
I'll see them during the day.

319
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,658
Axiom would run up to me.
He'd be, like, "Daddy!"

320
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,267
And he'd give me a hug
and I'd be like,

321
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,604
"Hey, sorry, I gotta go!"

322
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,357
I... I think at one point
we literally had this exchange.

323
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,735
"I'm a single mom taking care
of three kids."

324
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,069
- Yep.
- "I'm a single dad

325
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,155
taking care of 1,700 kids.â

326
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,407
It's my role as an activist

327
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,495
to... to help facilitate
this vision.

328
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,205
We're trying
to change the world.

329
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,374
Is there a limit

330
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,418
to the sacrifice
that you're willing to make

331
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,170
to fix the broken world?

332
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,634
Welcome
to SmartCash Smart Talk Radio.

333
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,930
And we have Lily and John

334
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,264
with Anarchaforko.

335
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,103
How would you like to introduce
our audience to Anarchaforko

336
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,480
and tell us what it's about?

337
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,612
Honestly, um, most people
don't understand it yet.

338
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,156
It's kind of a completely
different idea,

339
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,784
'cause everybody with a ticket
can add an event.

340
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,412
You know, it's not up to us,

341
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,748
it's up to them
to do it themselves.

342
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,169
That we want to give people
the opportunity

343
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:57,422
to sculpt the experience
they want out of Anarchaforko.

344
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,729
The whole idea of this thing

345
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,648
is it's supposed to be
the participants

346
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,401
that do most
of the actual content.

347
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,486
They all seemed to wait
until the last minute

348
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,737
to advertise

349
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,740
what they were doing.
So, to us organizers,

350
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,159
it almost seemed like
nothing was going to happen.

351
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,625
Whoo!

352
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,720
We're most excited to see
just what people put on

353
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
and what people
are interested in.

354
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,390
I've had so many people

355
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,516
come up to me today,

356
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,102
and I was even
a little worried myself.

357
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,621
They're like,
"What are we doing today?"

358
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,440
And I was like, "Well, maybe
I should look on the schedule."

359
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,823
So that way,
the more we use the system,

360
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,076
the more financially
we benefit from it.

361
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,872
There was everything from like,

362
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,126
workshops on aromatherapy
to like jam sessions.

363
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,794
It was pretty much like
all the stuff

364
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,564
that people were saying
that they wanted to do

365
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,256
at Anarchapulco,
but that Anarchapulco

366
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,924
was currently too big to do.

367
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,676
You start to reorganize stuff

368
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
from the inside,

369
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,971
you are making change
on the outside.

370
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,615
So, that's why I'm saying
how we could bring

371
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,932
more anarchy into the world,

372
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,184
- is actually by...
- Yep.

373
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,853
Honoring these things
on the micro level...

374
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,106
This was completely free
and voluntary

375
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,733
and self-organized.

376
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,277
And it was spontaneous!
That's the thing.

377
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,239
I loved it.
I love the idea,

378
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,533
I love the start to it,
it was humble.

379
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,746
It wasn't, you know,
this extravagant thing.

380
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,997
It's kind of your baby,

381
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,874
so you always want more
and whatnot,

382
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,226
but we definitely
weren't disappointed

383
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,669
with the numbers we got.
It was above our minimum,

384
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,088
to consider it a success,

385
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,006
so we were happy with it,
you know?

386
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,092
Yeah.

387
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,345
This is the OG Broncnutz
from the 719 West West,

388
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,764
still down here
and Anarchaforko,

389
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,141
we're with some
SmartCash developers,

390
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,142
which I told y'all

391
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,519
I was gonna bring.

392
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,853
SmartCash sponsored us.

393
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,147
SmartCash is like a fork
of Bit coin.

394
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,776
And they sent
representatives and everything

395
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,861
as part of,
you know, the package.

396
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,699
Well, Paul, being what he was...

397
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,787
"You wanna try some cocaine?
You wanna try some cocaine?

398
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,080
You wanna try some cocaine?"

399
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,749
It was literally to everybody,
including our sponsors.

400
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,337
After that, SmartCash
just wasn't really around.

401
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,297
We just thought they were flaky.

402
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,842
We started to, like,
plan the next one

403
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,885
and we contacted SmartCash,
and they're like,

404
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,847
"We're not interested
because of this guy,"

405
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,182
who said he represented
your event.â We're like,

406
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,519
"He had nothing to do
other than that he was there,"

407
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,980
and that he was staying
with us at the time.â

408
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,915
That was the point
where John and Lily just decided

409
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,476
they didn't want anything
to do with him.

410
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,501
They locked him out.

411
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,770
They didn't want him
there anyway

412
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,438
and they didn't give him a key
and they made sure

413
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,881
that the doors were locked.

414
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,010
And then you step in.

415
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,512
Yeah, well, I... I...
yeah, actually.

416
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,097
I didn't say,
"You can stay with me."

417
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,867
He just says, "I got
no place to go, brother",

418
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,517
they put my stuff
out in the street now.â

419
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,021
We picked up his stuff
and put it in a van

420
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,814
and moved it down to my house.

421
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,191
I took him in because I felt bad

422
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,400
and we were bro-y.

423
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,821
And John said, "Don't let him
move in with you."

424
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,241
And I'm thinking, "Don't tell me
what to do, you know",

425
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,452
like... like,
what are you doing?"

426
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,913
We were just like,
"Why are you helping him?"

427
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,040
And he was like,
"Somebody has to."

428
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,084
And we're like, "Good luck!"

429
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,174
It seemed that
these two divergent visions

430
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,553
of an anarchist conference
could potentially coexist.

431
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,277
But this new foundation
that the community

432
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,434
had built itself on
was beginning to crack.

433
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,520
Bit coin has fallen
from 16,000 dollars

434
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,315
to, currently
it's about 9,000 dollars.

435
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,317
Bit coin continues
its steep slide

436
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,152
down more than 20 percent.

437
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,655
How low can Bit coin go?

438
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,341
Today we will, of course,
be talking about

439
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,951
the latest drop
in the crypto markets.

440
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,119
Bit coin was
slowly declining in value

441
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,372
ever since
its peak the year before.

442
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,665
We need to find a bottom,

443
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,643
and then once we find a bottom,
we build a foundation

444
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,835
we go up.
That's how it works.

445
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,422
But still hungover
from 2017's crypto euphoria,

446
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,299
the movement doubled down.

447
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,468
I'm holding on to my damn coins,
I'm not giving up!

448
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,179
The fact of the matter is
that this is a completely normal

449
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,808
market retracement
to a wild and crazy 2017.

450
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,894
Scared money don't make
no money, man. Fuck it!

451
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,622
It's just so hard for me
to fathom Bit coin

452
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,939
going that low, honestly.

453
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,107
The time to buy

454
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,276
is when there's blood
in the streets.

455
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,821
The blood is in the streets.
So, what are you gonna do?

456
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,033
Despite the hope
for a long-term rebound,

457
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,120
the community's crypto lifeblood
was being drained

458
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,623
threatening
their forward momentum.

459
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,802
Anarchapulco put
a lot of stress on our family.

460
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,429
Every year, it's kind of like

461
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,390
when you have children,
you forget the first six months

462
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,516
after they're born.

463
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,395
- Yay!
- Yay!

464
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,480
So, you're like,
"Oh, you know what,

465
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,941
"let's have kids," and you forget

466
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,985
what... How much
of a struggle it can be,

467
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,487
um, so you keep doing it again.

468
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,489
- You're really hungry?
- Yeah.

469
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,373
- What would you like to have?
- I don't know.

470
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,803
- Wait, what if we put...
- I don't know how to make "I don't know."

471
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,370
We're actually
out of "I don't know."

472
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,621
Yeah, I know...

473
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,832
You were feeling nauseous
throughout the day.

474
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,209
Yeah, I'd wake up shaking,
and go to bed crying.

475
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,729
I'd have nightmares
where we were about

476
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,772
to start the conference
and I realized I'd forgotten

477
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,607
to buy any of the plane tickets
for the speakers.

478
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,216
Or like you didn't have pants,

479
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,385
and, you know.

480
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,511
Drink?

481
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,805
I'm having one.

482
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,977
He was getting exhausted.

483
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,771
I told him it was time
that we started

484
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,106
getting some help
with the conference.

485
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,900
And I really pushed.

486
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,111
I'm like, "We need to get
somebody professional"

487
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,906
to be sort of more
in the background

488
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,991
"doing the logistics."

489
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,534
"And you can do the big stuff,"

490
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,119
and, you know,
we can do the ideas

491
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,205
and the management,
you know, aspects,

492
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,291
"but, logistically,
we need to start delegating."

493
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,379
Jeff agreed we needed
to have more people involved

494
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,381
and we wanted to bring on
somebody full-time.

495
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,052
And I suggested
bringing on Dayna Martin.

496
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,970
Hi, everybody.

497
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,099
She had such a deep background

498
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,266
with Anarchapulco.

499
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,437
She had been to all four events
up to that year.

500
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,897
I'm here tonight
with Larken Rose

501
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,899
and Amanda Rachwitz. Hey, guys!

502
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,150
- Hi.
- Hey.

503
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,862
She knew the speakers,
she knew the audience.

504
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,241
I think that compassion
is an instinctual

505
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,076
emotion within us,
we're born with it...

506
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,619
And she has great creative ideas

507
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,664
about how to set up events
like this.

508
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,126
Berwick had somebody else
in mind,

509
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,627
her name was Jessica Kill.

510
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,006
She approached
Jeff Berwick and said,

511
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,427
I've got all this experience
producing events in Hollywood,

512
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,305
why don't you let me help
produce Anarchapulco next year?

513
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,475
And she was already embedded
in the conference

514
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,977
through Bit Club.

515
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,272
She was their main
logistical person.

516
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,649
She seemed
professionally competent,

517
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,609
definitely assertive.

518
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,111
Jeff and I agreed that, yes,

519
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,488
these are two people we'd like
to add to the team.

520
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,991
This is really wonderful.
I'm really excited.

521
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,784
So, for those of you
who don't know me,

522
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,245
I'm Jessica Kill,
I'm one of the producers

523
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,747
on the team for Anarchapulco.

524
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm the community producer
of the event.

525
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,727
Such an honor to be here
with you on Facebook Live...

526
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,838
Dayna was offered,
like an assistant job

527
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,840
because she didn't have
as much experience

528
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,675
in coordinating
a conference the size

529
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,011
of Anarchapulco.

530
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,139
So many things
just came together.

531
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:40,361
Ever since Anarchapulco,
Paul was using... a lot.

532
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,239
I don't think he slept that whole
time, and I think that took a toll.

533
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,244
And I think
after what happened to Gino,

534
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,329
he got worse.

535
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,668
Gino was one of Paul's friends
in the community.

536
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,255
They were both military vets.

537
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,216
They both battled
and they both saw things

538
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,593
a certain way and they could
speak a certain language

539
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,178
and they'd understand
each other.

540
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,806
Paul took a liking to him

541
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,934
because he was another
messed-up guy.

542
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,144
Paul kind of had this kinship

543
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,730
with people who were
just a little screwy.

544
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,858
They both have drug problems

545
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,735
and they would train together,

546
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,154
like he would join them
for workout sessions

547
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,323
at the Anarchastle.

548
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:30,703
Gino was being very aggressive
and belligerent.

549
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,039
And in Acapulco, like,
if you get aggressive

550
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,266
and annoying for long enough,

551
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,930
eventually someone
is gonna deal with you.

552
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,464
Gino got into a fight
and got killed.

553
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,092
Do you know what happened?

554
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,429
I was told he picked
a fight with a few guys

555
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,806
and then they crushed his head.

556
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,229
Those who know Gino,

557
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,232
know how deep he cut me.
True soldier.

558
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,318
You understood me.

559
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,612
You stood with me
through my hell.

560
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,075
Gino's death just compounded

561
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,077
all the frustration and anger

562
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,247
that Paul was dealing
with all the time

563
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,559
bored off my ass, and made
friends with this old man

564
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,626
with society

565
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,255
his past experiences
with bad relationships.

566
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,759
It just added on top
of the mess that Paul was.

567
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,349
Paul, like,
he did not get over Gino.

568
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,145
I realized after that,
that there's a lot of bloodshed

569
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,689
in the city, just all over
the place, all the time.

570
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,612
We started following that page

571
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,114
where they report
all the murders and stuff,

572
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,701
"Lo real de Acapulco."

573
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,579
We also kind of realized

574
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,248
just how bad it was
when we went to that cemetery

575
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,625
at the top of the hill.

576
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,547
You'd find entire families
that had died on the same day

577
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,258
buried in the same plot.

578
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,430
Paul was very rapidly declining.

579
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,326
There were times where you'd
just see him weeping,

580
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,536
and there were other times
where he's just feeling violent

581
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,895
and he wanted to fight.

582
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,773
There was always just
this roller coaster with Paul.

583
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,526
He put his whiteboard
in my living room

584
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,196
and started drawing up plans,
and nonstop talking

585
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,907
about how he was gonna
take advantage or hurt somebody.

586
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,747
I had mentioned
in passing with Paul one time,

587
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,999
that my ex-wife had
life insurance policy

588
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,083
that pays out to me.

589
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,711
He saw that I was sad sometimes,

590
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,423
and he really wanted to help me,
in his own bizarre way.

591
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,553
He kept...
offering to

592
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,639
kill my ex-wife.

593
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,893
And I was just like, "I'd rather
be broke in a ditch, dude",

594
00:32:58,976 --> 00:32:59,977
let it go.â

595
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,820
And then over three weeks,

596
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,905
he got more
and more serious, so...

597
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,242
I decided to... I had to leave,

598
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,870
for a little while
until things cooled down.

599
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,290
My plan to get out
of that situation

600
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,168
was to use my mother's birthday
as an excuse

601
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,586
to come back to the States.

602
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,922
And just get away from him.

603
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,434
Is that music I hear?

604
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,395
Oh, did I not bring my phone,
I don't need my phone, do I?

605
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,152
Here.
Let me have your hand.

606
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,405
Oh, gosh, I just realized

607
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,928
just how emotional I'm gonna be
by the time we get down there.

608
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,328
Well, because

609
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,081
we're gonna be in front
of all our favorite people,

610
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,709
and mommy and I
are gonna talk about

611
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,877
how much we love each other

612
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,379
and how happy we are
to be together.

613
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,800
The energy of the conference

614
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,761
was so overwhelming.

615
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:19,432
Nathan and I were like,
we need a fresh start.

616
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,938
We never really had
a fancy wedding.

617
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,650
I wanted to do
the big wedding later,

618
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,611
after we've stayed together
for a while.

619
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,906
Like, let's prove
that this is for real.

620
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,241
Thank you.

621
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,910
I just... I don't have
any underwear on,

622
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,870
- so if you see more just...
- Me too!

623
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,705
Okay, good!

624
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,999
Lisa and Nathan,

625
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:48,461
when you first joined
in marriage some 14 years ago,

626
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,171
you really had no idea

627
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,465
what life would have
in store for you.

628
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,301
So, in 2018,
we made the decision

629
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,846
that we're gonna be
with all our friends.

630
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,807
You know, we don't have
to fly everybody in,

631
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,367
they're already there
for the conference.

632
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,269
So why don't we have
a ceremony on the beach.

633
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,525
This is the circle
you have now built together.

634
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,904
- Friends, family... Mommy, it's okay.
- It's okay.

635
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,199
And an entire community
that support you,

636
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,868
and you, in turn, support.

637
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,956
This is today's ring.

638
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,213
We made it.

639
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,464
Wow!

640
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,174
- Love you.
- I love you too.

641
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,442
I love you.

642
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,406
Nathan,
do you reaffirm your love

643
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,867
and commitment for Lisa,

644
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,745
and care for her
in sickness and in health?

645
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,873
I do.

646
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,917
Lisa, will you continue

647
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,168
to support Nathan

648
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,713
your husband,
and continue to live

649
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,049
- in this happy, loving marriage?
- I do.

650
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,928
So, by the powers invested in me

651
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,890
- by no state at all...
- Whoo!

652
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,394
Please celebrate
this renewal of vows

653
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,897
with the sign of affection
that you choose.

654
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,982
I love you.

655
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,827
I love you.

656
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,621
I can't believe we got here...

657
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,046
All righty, guys,
we're gonna go ahead

658
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:59,008
and, uh, start up a Streets
of Acapulco Series 2.0.

659
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,219
And then, uh, we'll see

660
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,970
a bunch of people looking
at me all funny.

661
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,732
When I got back into town,

662
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,359
John and Lily took me in.

663
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,487
I've got no AT&T signal
out here.

664
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,376
But there's lots
of cute little restaurants

665
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,449
and little bars.

666
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,371
Yeah.

667
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,123
We got right back
into a daily routine

668
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,792
of hanging out every day,

669
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,671
and we just started trying
to pull ourselves together

670
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,838
and get the Fork ready.

671
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,218
Around that time...

672
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,305
I was going to the market.

673
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,975
And ahead of me, what I saw

674
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,851
was Paul

675
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,562
and Chris, Henza's ex-wife.

676
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,442
Paul had bounced around
the community a little bit.

677
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:09,495
And, one day he ran
across my ex-wife

678
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,871
and her boyfriend, ModProbe,

679
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,125
and they took him in.

680
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,089
He was just quietly hanging out
at ModProbe's mansion,

681
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,801
enjoying the pool and just
sitting back and relaxing.

682
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:29,223
I tried to warn her
that he wanted to kill her,

683
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,267
and that didn't go well.

684
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,645
Paul admitted to it.

685
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,734
He says, "Yeah,
but he wanted me to kill you."

686
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,088
And I just threw my hands up in
the air, and I said, "I give up",

687
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,699
I'm not talking
about this anymore,

688
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,242
"and hopefully,
you won't get hurt."

689
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,556
And then right
when that happened,

690
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,540
that's when Paul started
threatening us.

691
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,086
I came to know
John and Lily very well

692
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,505
during my stay here
in beautiful Acapulco.

693
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,884
I actually saw the true side

694
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,136
of these wannabe celebritarians.

695
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,513
I know where the next step

696
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,515
in the escalation
of this will go.

697
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,976
Trust me, children,

698
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,980
you do not want me taking things
in that direction, so behave.

699
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,902
He would threaten us,

700
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,030
and then he would obsess
about us all day.

701
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,657
Paul was crusading
for his justice

702
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,452
in his own mind,
from being turned away.

703
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,913
Paul felt like he should
always be accepted by us,

704
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,457
regardless of who he is,
what's he doing.

705
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,293
When you talk as much shit

706
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,837
and pull the stunts
that you have

707
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,757
we might have to take it
outside and fight it out.

708
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,677
We can wear gloves
so I don't mess up

709
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,596
that pretty face too much.

710
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,475
But John Galton,
we gonna throw down.

711
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,357
I started getting
weird messages from Paul.

712
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,903
He was ranting to me about Lily,

713
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,531
and there was something
that he didn't like about John.

714
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,534
We weren't even that close.

715
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,451
I couldn't even place

716
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,328
why he thought
I should be messaged.

717
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,914
It seemed to me like a lot

718
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,333
of his internal struggles

719
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,669
they weren't just about Lily
and John.

720
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,756
They were about his own stuff
that I never fully understood,

721
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,134
and I don't think
he fully understood.

722
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,344
I'll never forget that,
like, in the slew

723
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,555
of incoherent messaging I got

724
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,350
he said,
"Regardless of things I did,

725
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:39,520
I really cared
about those kids."

726
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,022
The way he was talking sounded
like something happened

727
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,191
that was traumatic.

728
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,860
So much so, he didn't seem
to be okay

729
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,028
with saying what it was.

730
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,489
But I could tell that
it was definitely connected

731
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,158
to stuff he did in the military,

732
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,660
that I think
he didn't forgive himself for.

733
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:02,460
He felt this overwhelming
moral justice belief system,

734
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,254
that he was the antihero,
that he was the only one

735
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,882
that saw things
as they really were.

736
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,594
He felt like he had this job
to protect people,

737
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,890
but didn't see how his behavior
was causing people

738
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,266
the need to be protected.

739
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,730
In my nurturing personality,

740
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,690
I would, you know,
check in with him

741
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,773
and just let him know

742
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,085
that someone's
thinking about him,

743
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,652
that someone cares about him.

744
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,155
I tried to, like

745
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,533
invoke,
like, pull the best out of him.

746
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,578
And like, suppress the other,
right? Like, I was trying to,

747
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,246
like, influence him
in a good direction.

748
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,541
I really advocated for him

749
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,877
to do labor on a, like,
a fruit farm kind of thing,

750
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,131
you know? And you just...
A chance to restart a new life.

751
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,734
You know, even in Mexico,
I researched.

752
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,677
I had done this research, cause
I wanted to present solutions.

753
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,596
But he didn't want any
of the solutions,

754
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,889
any of the ideas.

755
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,160
So, at that point,
I had been in Acapulco,

756
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,561
you know, over two years,
I think two and a half.

757
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,690
Um, and I... I was

758
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,944
wanting to rest and recover.

759
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:14,448
Erika left Acapulco
and moved to Belize

760
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,825
to restart her life away
from the turmoil

761
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,327
of the community.

762
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,120
I don't know
what the percentage would be,

763
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,289
but it's like blindingly White.

764
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,376
I stared to feel
an accumulative effect

765
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,337
of being so "other."
I'm the other other.

766
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,673
I'm like expat,
but even among the expats,

767
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,383
I still don't necess... You know,

768
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,402
I'm still aware that y'all
are having conversations

769
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,930
that you hold for when I leave.
I know this.

770
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,848
And I just thought
that there could be

771
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,895
more represented than...
than just drama and crypto.

772
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,692
There were all these variables,
like volatile things,

773
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,486
unpredictable things,
dangerous things,

774
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,447
and they're all, like,
kinda like, being juggled.

775
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,634
I don't really... I don't know,
I could not keep account

776
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,493
of whose hands threw
which balls.

777
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:02,204
I just know that there were all
of these factors,

778
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,083
and that...

779
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,420
There's... Something is... something
was gonna implode eventually.

780
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,676
There's a Telegram group

781
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,012
all about the communication
of everybody

782
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,515
in the production team
for the conference,

783
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,645
and Nathan was blocked.

784
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,858
He was no longer allowed
to be in this group.

785
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,904
And then he was cut out
of Anarchapulco's email.

786
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,035
Nathan and I
were really concerned

787
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,079
that there was some
very sketchy stuff

788
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,372
happening behind the scenes.

789
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,794
I'm here with Nathan Freeman,
in beautiful Acapulco, Mexico.

790
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,131
Nathan Freeman, he runs
the Anarchapulco conference

791
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,029
with Nathan Freeman,
the chief cat herder.

792
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,637
- Great to see you, man.
- Yeah.

793
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,515
As a person,
I've always gotten along

794
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,933
really well with Nathan,

795
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,561
and we had a lot of fun
running Anarchapulco.

796
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,855
He did so many things great,

797
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,066
especially the people
sort of stuff.

798
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,401
He knows, like,
the... the community very well,

799
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,862
he's friends with most
of the people in the community.

800
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,906
But with Nathan

801
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,700
there's always lots of problems.

802
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,348
'Cause Nathan didn't really know

803
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,624
how to run events,
he was just winging it.

804
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,101
Which worked fine
for a couple of years,

805
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,960
but it grew to such a big size.

806
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,179
The thing
that really set me off...

807
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,099
Special gratitude
from the Anarchapulco team

808
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,392
for your attendance

809
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,228
at this lovely event
here tonight.

810
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:53,148
Was the 2018
VIP dinner with Ron Paul

811
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,400
and everything.

812
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,784
Before the event, there's like
people lined up

813
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,578
for like half a kilometer,
and I'm like, "What's going on?"

814
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,080
They're like,
"There's no one there

815
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,266
to even take the tickets." And
I was like, "Where's Nathan?"

816
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,792
And someone's like,
"He's sleeping."

817
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,585
So, the only thing

818
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,797
that changes Washington
is when the prevailing attitude

819
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,257
of the country changes...

820
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,634
I actually had to take
tickets for like an hour.

821
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,553
And I'm like,
"So sorry about this, so sorry,

822
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,138
"you want chicken?" Like...

823
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,768
But Jessica Kill, she's like,
"I got spreadsheets."

824
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,939
She was really good
with times and money,

825
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,942
like a real pro person
who knows how to run events.

826
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,820
He decided that she should be

827
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,238
the executive producer.

828
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,907
He described it as a CEO role.

829
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,658
Which was a little weird,

830
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,287
'cause I was like,
"Huh, then what am I?"

831
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,955
That makes no sense.

832
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,957
The guy who's been running it
for three years,

833
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,125
you're gonna push out,

834
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,836
when he's the one
that has all the information

835
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,171
on how things run?

836
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,884
He kinda felt like it was,
like, his thing.

837
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,887
And it's not even,
like my thing, really,

838
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,388
like, I just want it
to run well.

839
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,851
Kill sold him on her ability

840
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,979
to delegate and be in control
of a conference.

841
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,232
It never sat well with him.

842
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,651
And I think he kinda felt

843
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,779
like I ran him
out of Anarchapulco, but

844
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,240
that really wasn't the case

845
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,493
and, I don't know,
it just got a little weird.

846
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,702
Just weird.

847
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,082
Bit coin getting
a beatdown today,

848
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,084
falling below 5,000
for the first time

849
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,377
in more than a year.

850
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,795
Now down 25 percent

851
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,256
and just to 300 bucks
in the past hour.

852
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,217
If you're looking
at the market right now,

853
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,052
you're probably freaking out.

854
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,803
Crypto crash!

855
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,556
Dawgs, look at Bit coin
all-time low,

856
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,558
why is the price falling so low?

857
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,560
Holy fucking shit!

858
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,312
I'm losing everything, bro!

859
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,773
Near the end of 2018,

860
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,942
cryptocurrency prices
bottomed out.

861
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,530
Bit coin plunged
nearly 17,000 dollars

862
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,823
from its peak
just one year before,

863
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,117
bringing the rest
of the market down with it.

864
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,163
It was tough,
I was working hard.

865
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,624
Not a whole lot of money
was coming in.

866
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,918
And the conference
had a problem,

867
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,641
which is, where do you get
the money from?

868
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,672
And the money is coming
from sponsors.

869
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,048
And who are the sponsors?

870
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,531
Well, they're crypto projects
that are looking for attention.

871
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,886
SmartCash sponsored us big

872
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,471
when they were over
a dollar coin

873
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,515
and then they were
a quarter of that.

874
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,891
And then it was just like,

875
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,060
"Well, we got no money
to sponsor you."

876
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,238
And you'd just hear it
on social media, like,

877
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,483
"I'd like to go, but, you know,
I just... I'm down 80 percent"

878
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,443
this year and I can't afford
the, you know,

879
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,127
the expense,"
and all that kind of stuff.

880
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,406
We were struggling.

881
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,825
John was borrowing money
just to pay for rent.

882
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,412
No money, nothing going on.

883
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,973
We're all getting
pretty desperate up there,

884
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,082
and John and Lily
were just at their wits' end

885
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,877
because they weren't making it,
and... it was sad.

886
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,687
We were done, over.

887
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,946
The new year.

888
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,786
This was the best part
about living in Acapulco.

889
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,123
Damn!

890
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,667
We were shooting fireworks
off our house.

891
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,462
Like big fireworks,
like professional fireworks.

892
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,344
So, how do you remember
feeling around that time?

893
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,057
So exhausted.

894
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,395
Fuck, I'm exhausted thinking
about it.

895
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,200
I don't know
what we were thinking, honestly,

896
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,694
like, we were just
trying to survive.

897
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,908
"I wish my life was simpler."

898
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,887
That's all I remember thinking,

899
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,704
was that I wished my life
was simpler.

900
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,335
And I was just like, "Okay..."

901
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,254
What now?"

902
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,675
What the fuck
is this year going to bring?

903
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:45,732
Uh, if somebody's listening,
please, I just...

904
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,485
Somebody showed up right
after we finished eating

905
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,029
and they shot John and Henza,

906
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,864
and I was in the house

907
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,033
and John's dead at the gate!

908
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,959
Henza's in the other room dying,
and I really need help.

909
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,877
Somebody, please come!

909
00:50:06,305 --> 00:51:06,554
