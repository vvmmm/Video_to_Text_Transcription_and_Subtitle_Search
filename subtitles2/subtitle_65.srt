FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,117
The Vice CEOâ¦

4
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,043
has a fiancÃ©e he will marry soon.

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,617
This industry is small.

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,535
Someone at the headquarters said

7
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,753
he's been living with this woman
since he was in the US.

8
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,415
His girlfriend he's been dating
for nine years.

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,216
Anyway, I heard
they're getting married in Korea.

10
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,231
What's so funny about what I just said?

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,937
Justâ¦

12
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,023
You think

13
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,613
I'm a joke, right?

14
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,612
Because I'm always spreading rumors

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,534
and acting cute on Monday mornings?

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,658
My ex-boyfriend
dumped me after nine years.

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,954
I'm traumatized by that.

18
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,327
You just reopened my wound.

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,207
That's why I laughed.

20
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,673
The trauma.

21
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,125
Me and my careless mouth.

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,217
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,103
He is Mr. Playboy.
But the class is dismissed!

24
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,187
{\an8}MESSAGE FROM IM GEON-JOO

25
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,856
{\an8}Want to have dinner at my place?

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,238
{\an8}I'll cook for you.

27
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,702
{\an8}I also have something to say to you.

28
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,887
I'll go to your workplace.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,141
Let's talk during lunch.

30
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,701
By the way,

31
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,332
I'm asking just in case I make a mistake.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,800
Does our eldest daughterâ¦

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,760
know about it?

34
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,429
Eun-joo knows about what?

35
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,347
Hi.

36
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,153
-Hi.
-Hi.

37
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,899
Does she know

38
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,494
that I am notâ¦

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,529
her biological father?

40
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,561
Eun-joo doesn't know.

41
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,612
Weâ¦

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,074
decided not to talk about that ever again.

43
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,281
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,659
I was asking so I don't make any mistakes.

45
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,231
What were you doing
until things got this bad?

46
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,312
I think we can still meet the deadline.

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,398
Yes.

48
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,032
FATHER

49
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,501
Why are you so early?

50
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,921
Are you going somewhere?

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,090
YOUNGER DAUGHTER

52
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,586
ELDEST DAUGHTER

53
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,734
-Yes, Eun-joo.
-Finish your call first.

54
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,610
Dad.

55
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:16,864
Yes.

56
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,111
Are you okay?

57
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,109
Are you well enough to come home?

58
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,645
Of course.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,947
Don't worry. I'm fine.

60
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,583
I'll go see you in the evening.

61
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,910
What about Mom?

62
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,825
Mom.

63
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,581
Are you okay?

64
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,214
I'm okay.

65
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,881
Can Dad leave the hospital?

66
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,839
Yes.

67
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,588
Is he still 22 years old?

68
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,966
See you at home.

69
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,089
Gosh. I guess he still is.

70
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,757
Mom, don't cook dinner. Let's order in.

71
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,136
Sure.

72
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,722
Let me talk to the young Dad.

73
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,057
She's with me.

74
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,562
Let me talk to her, please.

75
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,896
I'm here.

76
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,994
Mom, you must be tired.
Don't cook anything.

77
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,952
I'll bring meat, so let's just eat that.

78
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,782
Dad loves meat.

79
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,947
All right.

80
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,035
Dad, congratulations on being
discharged from the hospital!

81
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,501
See you in the evening.

82
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,671
Okay.

83
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,091
See you in the evening.

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,649
You left your precious laptop here?

85
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,191
I could've brought it to you.

86
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,614
The patients must be waiting.

87
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,153
I just took my lunch break early.

88
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,405
I work as a freelancer from time to time.
The office asks me for help

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,703
when they encounter a picky client
whom I've dealt with before.

90
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,578
Since when?

91
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,753
It's been a while.

92
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,626
So you really weren't writing.

93
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,917
Why didn't you tell me?

94
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,585
I know, right?

95
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,586
I wonder why I didn't tell you.

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,688
Won't you be late?

97
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,404
Right.

98
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,315
This client is quite a handful.

99
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,822
I'm running short on time.

100
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,198
Let's talk later.

101
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,579
No need to talk later.

102
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,409
If you want to work, then work.

103
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,054
This must be why I didn't tell you.

104
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,552
You're not interested in me.

105
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,335
No.

106
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,469
Not just me.

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,640
You seem like you're not
interested in the world.

108
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,812
You're getting weirder and weirder.
Have you always been like this?

109
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,609
You really must be working,
seeing that you're getting edgy.

110
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,355
You said you're late.

111
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,567
Yes, I'm late.

112
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,079
I'm late.

113
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,253
Too late.

114
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,286
I can't go to the meeting in this mood.

115
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,791
It's better to relieve it even if I'm late

116
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,333
than frown at work.

117
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,037
There's nothing to relieve.

118
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,342
It's not like
you can't control your emotions.

119
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,472
You're keeping a secret from me, right?

120
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,814
Does the word "secret"
sound inappropriate?

121
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,570
Do you have an issue
you can't tell me about?

122
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,199
Yes, you do.

123
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,123
I know you do.

124
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,624
Tell me.

125
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,203
I'll help you.

126
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:45,997
Help me?

127
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,549
Yes.

128
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,553
How reassuring.

129
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,965
If there's a secret that can be solved
immediately with your help,

130
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,933
then I'll tell you.

131
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,903
Is the word "help"
that uncomfortable between family?

132
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,479
-Let's stop this.
-Then I take it back.

133
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,437
I'll listen.

134
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,277
Tell me whenever you want to.

135
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,253
Don't forget we're visiting
my family later tonight.

136
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,692
Dad, get in.

137
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,733
I'll get in with your mother.
Let's wait for a bit.

138
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,361
Where's Mom?

139
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,608
Over there.

140
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,201
She's talking on the phone.

141
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,665
Get in.

142
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,378
Come on, get in.

143
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,184
Mom, who did you talk to?
Eun-joo or Eun-hee?

144
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,266
No.

145
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,057
Then who was it?

146
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,065
Are your sisters the only ones
I talk to on the phone?

147
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,228
I meanâ¦

148
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,145
Who was important enough
to leave Dad standing alone?

149
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,106
Ji-woo.

150
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,911
I'm capable of standing out
alone for a moment.

151
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,569
My condition isn't that bad.

152
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,658
It was the community center
asking about my absence.

153
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,205
Community center?

154
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,748
They're not a school.

155
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,462
Why do they care about attendance?

156
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,922
Who called exactly?

157
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,381
Would you even know if I told you?
Focus on driving.

158
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,382
What is a community center?

159
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,511
You learn a variety of things there.

160
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,852
What are you learning there?

161
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,274
What is it? Tell me, Ms. Sook.

162
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,902
What are you learning?

163
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,360
I'm learning about literature.

164
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,197
I told you to write poems

165
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,526
because you love to read books

166
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,332
and you speak so eloquently.

167
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,538
Right?

168
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,369
Aren't you writing poems, Ms. Sook?

169
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,205
I told you to stop calling me Ms. Sook.

170
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,511
I've forgotten about it.

171
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,098
He pouts his lips in three cases.

172
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,389
I want you to

173
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,222
buy these clothes.

174
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,688
I can buy this for you.
I'll be upset if you don't buy it.

175
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,517
Pouts when he's upset.

176
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,895
I want you to eat
three more spoonfuls of rice.

177
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,947
You eat too little.
Like a bird pecking on bird seeds.

178
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,332
Eat a bit more, okay?

179
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,333
Pouts when he begs.

180
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,168
It's so thick it won't fold.

181
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,169
And pouts when he's proud.

182
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,344
Why won't you let me call you Ms. Sook?

183
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,815
Over here.

184
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,609
Why are you hiding there?

185
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,655
I wasn't really hiding butâ¦

186
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,569
To protect an office worker?

187
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,832
Even if rumors spreadâ¦

188
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,621
I don't look that bad though, right?

189
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,667
What brings you here all of a sudden?

190
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,920
Did you come here because you were worried
after you got my text?

191
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,344
You said he turned out to be Mr. Playboy,

192
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,933
so I should be worried, right?

193
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,467
So why are you here?

194
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,808
When will the meditation
center book be out?

195
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,021
That?

196
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,391
We just got started. Why?

197
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,267
We shot a promotional video
ten times for social media,

198
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,685
but they aren't paying us a single penny.

199
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,688
They said they'll pay us

200
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,026
when the book is out.

201
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,031
It's because they don't know the industry.

202
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,203
Talk to them again.

203
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,321
I even asked them to pay us 30% for now,

204
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,158
but they won't until the book is out.

205
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,413
I was so furious,
so I had to come to see you.

206
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,498
I'm here but I've cooled down on my way.

207
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,341
How much is it?

208
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,169
Why do you ask?

209
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,554
Should I lend you some money for now?

210
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,761
Why?

211
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,342
Do you have a lot of money?

212
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,512
Office worker loan.

213
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,176
You still don't have a sense of money.

214
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,765
Just buy me a meal.

215
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,309
Will Ji-woo not get paid
if you have no money?

216
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,265
Just buy me a meal.

217
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,438
Why?

218
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,404
I'll lend you money, okay?

219
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,445
By the way,

220
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,698
how did you know Mr. Playboy is a playboy?

221
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,370
He's been dating for nine years.

222
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,410
Nine years?

223
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,120
Yes, nine years.

224
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,421
You can act like nothing happened

225
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,789
and ignore each other.

226
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,956
Yes, I should learn how to seduce
a player from this one-night stand.

227
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,842
That was too self-deprecating.

228
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,377
My female hormones have been building up

229
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,008
for five years, reached the limit,

230
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,104
and I made a mistake.

231
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,639
Yes, just think of it like that.

232
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,813
"Am I in love?"

233
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,691
"His bookshelf looks just like mine."
"We must have similar souls."

234
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,019
Don't be ridiculous.

235
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,363
He wants me to come over tonight to talk.

236
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,440
He wants to end it before it gets messy.

237
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,145
That's right, you told me and Jong-min

238
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,776
not to get messy at school
when we were dating.

239
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,871
You called dating "messy"
at that time too.

240
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,489
Wait.

241
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,786
But why ask you to come over to his place?

242
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,248
You think I'll make
the same mistake twice?

243
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,542
I do.

244
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,376
You littleâ¦

245
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,131
You know best what it's like
to date someone for nine years.

246
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,835
You've dated a guy for nine years

247
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,465
and slept with a guy
who's been dating for nine years.

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,430
Hey, I didn't know.

249
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,604
In any case,

250
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,522
it's more advantageous for you
since you've experienced both.

251
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,271
You can end it in a nicer, cleaner way.

252
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,444
Blow his mind by ending it nice and clean.

253
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,570
-Hello.
-Welcome.

254
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,159
I had breakfast.

255
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,720
You came here
so you wouldn't run into us, right?

256
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,468
No.

257
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,550
I was craving something greasy today.

258
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,135
Eun-hee isn't introducing us.

259
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,601
Hi, I'm Park Chan-hyuk.

260
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,181
Hi, I'm Seo Kyung-ok.

261
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,596
We're all Eun-hee's co-workers.

262
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,015
-Hi.
-Hi.

263
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,353
He's a university friend.

264
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,858
He's filming videos
for the meditation center.

265
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,399
-Yes.
-I see.

266
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,777
Right.

267
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,065
-I'm Im Geon-joo.
-I'm Park Chan-hyuk.

268
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,528
IM GEON-JOO

269
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:21,037
Okay, I'm paying today.
Would you like something more to drink?

270
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,000
Chan-hyuk, do you want
something more to drink?

271
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,795
-Let's go order together.
-How gentle.

272
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,684
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

273
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,639
-Thank you.
-Coffee for me.

274
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,299
If you two are university friends,

275
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,848
that means you've seen her
since she was a baby.

276
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,734
How long have you been friends?

277
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,895
It's been 15 years,

278
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
but we lost touch and met again recently.

279
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,783
Why did you get to meet again recently?
A wedding or a first birthday party?

280
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,779
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,822
Are you married?

282
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,615
No, I'm not.

283
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,539
He's not married, but he has a young,
smart, and pretty woman by his side.

284
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,213
All right, time for us to go.

285
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,750
You shouldn't use disposable cups
inside the restaurant.

286
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,842
Bye.

287
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
-See you next time.
-Sure.

288
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,187
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

289
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,358
We should go, too.

290
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,158
Companies hate employees
who use up their entire lunch break.

291
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,164
I lost my appetite.

292
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,955
Your destination is nearby.

293
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,749
Dad, we're almost there.

294
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,746
It feels familiar, right?

295
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,884
Yes, it does.

296
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,679
It's quite familiar.

297
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,466
I received all my education here.

298
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,971
Slow down when you're near the house.

299
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,848
I can't speed up
because of the speed bumps anyway.

300
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,239
Ji-woo, stop the car for a moment.

301
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,197
Why?

302
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,697
I have something to buy.

303
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,742
But I have no money.

304
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,044
Give me some pocket money.

305
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,440
THE YOO'S FRUIT SHOP

306
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
Thank you.

307
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,452
What are you trying to buy?

308
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,784
-I could get lost orâ¦
-You're a 22-year-old man, not a kid.

309
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,407
You became a father at that age.

310
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,914
Stop pouting, for goodness' sake!

311
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,550
I'm going to buy tangerines.

312
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,587
You like tangerines, Ms. Sook.

313
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,354
There are so many fruits here.

314
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,440
Is he Ji-woo's father?

315
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,106
Yes.

316
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,518
I see.

317
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,356
Nice to meet you.

318
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,032
Hello.

319
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,110
Yes.

320
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,247
By the way,
some of the tangerines are sour.

321
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,330
Ji-woo's mother likes Korean melons.

322
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,785
They're very sweet.

323
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,955
Korean melons?

324
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,458
Ms. Sook likes Korean melons?

325
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,593
Ms. Sook.

326
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,303
Which do you prefer?
Tangerines or Korean melons?

327
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,813
How competitive.
He's 22 years old, all right.

328
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,015
I'd like tangerines
and Korean melons, please.

329
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,200
Ji-woo, which one do you prefer?

330
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,161
Tangerines?

331
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,160
I prefer tangerines.

332
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,629
Why does it feel like
I have a younger brother all of a sudden?

333
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
How long has this fruit shop been here?

334
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,091
The fruit shop?

335
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,683
It's been here for a few years. Why?

336
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,434
The sign looks weird

337
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,636
and he wrote down such difficult things

338
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,226
as if he's smart or something.

339
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,902
Mr. Yoo used to be a university professor.

340
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,611
Then he opened the shop
because he had a purpose.

341
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,862
A professor?

342
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,324
Why?

343
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,908
Nothing.

344
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,035
Why was it his first time seeing me
if he's been here for a few years?

345
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,829
This was my first time
going to a fruit shop

346
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,624
near my house in the past few years?

347
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,342
But Ms. Sook loves fruit.

348
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,713
I'm Ahn Hyo-seok.

349
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,708
Okay.

350
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,080
Please sit and wait for a bit.

351
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,087
-Who's the next patient?
-The next patient?

352
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,143
Hi.

353
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,227
Why are you here so late?

354
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,145
If you took the case from the start,

355
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,520
Professor Jang and I
wouldn't be in this mess.

356
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,904
I took a look and it doesn't overlap.

357
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,701
You two can both apply for your patents.

358
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,029
It's been so long
and you don't even say hi.

359
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,332
That's very you, Attorney Kim.

360
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,699
Professor, you're the one
who didn't say hi and threw a fit instead.

361
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,785
Hey, bring Ms. Kim a cup of coffee.

362
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll do it.

363
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,876
I have a unique taste in coffee,
so it's better that I do it.

364
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,684
How did you get hurt?

365
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,345
I got stabbed with scissors.

366
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,226
Sewing scissors have sharp edges.

367
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,558
Looks like you got stabbed.

368
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,475
Lovers' quarrel.

369
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,240
Your girlfriend is strong.

370
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,782
We're going to treat it
and apply a dressing.

371
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,116
Leave it be for a few days.

372
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,657
-Get the ointment and a shot, please.
-Okay.

373
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,206
A wound this serious
isn't a lovers' quarrel.

374
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,585
Get a grip.

375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
You get a grip.

376
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,466
My girlfriend knows about you.

377
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,642
Tell Eun-joo before I tell her myself.

378
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,596
I'm giving you a chance.

379
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,964
Here you go.

380
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,746
Attorney Kim.

381
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,416
Are you working again?

382
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,915
As you can see.

383
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,180
Is your husband too weak
to have kids with you?

384
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,218
Be honest.

385
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,517
You're starting to work again
since you don't have kids, right?

386
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,146
Your style totally changed.

387
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,982
You're at the ageâ¦

388
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,194
when you truly bloom.

389
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,737
Then why aren't your
theses blooming, Professor?

390
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,162
Be careful.

391
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,499
I checked and many of your
patented theses have problems.

392
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,077
Thirty-four years of work
can end in a second.

393
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,995
And stop getting help from your students.

394
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,956
Especially the female students.

395
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,048
You used to say girls should be
thankful for even going to university.

396
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,682
But why are you always
asking for their help?

397
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,097
How cute.

398
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,272
And very immature.

399
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,821
Excuse me.

400
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,621
Hey.

401
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
It's me.

402
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,325
I'll pick you up for dinner today.

403
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,829
It's okay, I'll take a taxi.

404
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,667
I have something to say.

405
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,554
Okay.

406
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,971
I'm at Hanguk University.

407
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,006
Come say hi to the professor
I work with then.

408
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,925
He's worried that you might be too weak.

409
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,232
Come on, Attorney Kim.

410
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,481
I said that because I thought of you
as my married daughter.

411
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:15,784
I'm afraid your husband
might get the wrong idea.

412
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,914
This is why field trips are important.

413
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,165
From what I saw, you like Mr. Playboy.

414
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:36,049
You were drawing lines to make sure
he doesn't get the wrong idea about us.

415
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,051
I have a young, smart,
and pretty girl by my side?

416
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,675
You do.

417
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,761
She's just an employee.

418
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,598
It's not that I like him,

419
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,267
but I was impressed
that he and I have so many similarities.

420
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,187
My mom

421
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,946
saves wet wipes and paper towels.

422
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,450
She always splits them in half,
and even in quarters at times.

423
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,914
And I'm doing that, too.

424
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,832
You?

425
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,590
After I started the company, I started
saving wet wipes and paper towels.

426
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,248
Gosh, it gives me chills.

427
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,258
I read from a book

428
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,339
that the DNA of cheapskates
is powerfully dominant.

429
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,008
So a family of cheapskates has a
high chance of being cheapskates forever.

430
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,678
How can you interpret
a minor metaphor with science?

431
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,438
Did you study DNA or something?

432
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,349
Yes.

433
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,194
Why?

434
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,318
Because my sister and I aren't alike.

435
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,070
We're different in every aspect.

436
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,573
That's not a DNA problem.

437
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,739
I'm sure it's hard
to find anyone like Eun-joo.

438
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,985
She'sâ¦

439
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,659
perfect and wonderful.

440
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,456
Who? Kim Eun-joo? Perfect?

441
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,247
I'm leaving.

442
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,401
Get some rest in the bedroom.

443
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,900
Tae-hyung is going to check on you
when he comes for dinner.

444
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:33,288
I remember the day we took
this photo like it was yesterday.

445
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,083
I'm sure you do.

446
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,956
You're 22 years old now.

447
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,093
The photographer said

448
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,968
that we look alike and smile the same.

449
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,929
If couples look alike, they live happily.

450
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,262
You wanted to have the photo taken.

451
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,809
I did?

452
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,680
You said you'd frame this

453
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,437
and keep it until you grew old

454
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,150
to remember this day forever.

455
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,820
I don't remember.

456
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,275
You can't remember a few decades at all,

457
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,990
and I can't remember that moment at all.

458
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,782
So it's a tie.

459
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,365
We can't blame each other.

460
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,369
Are you angry at me?

461
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,412
I'm not.

462
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,219
Weâ¦

463
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,631
I mean, me.

464
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,598
What's my score?

465
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,175
About what?

466
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,934
I remember saying

467
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,266
that I'll be a 99-point husband
for the rest of my life.

468
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,160
Do you remember when I peeled tangerines
until my hands turned yellow

469
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,876
when you caught a cold
while you were pregnant?

470
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,338
My hands really turned yellow.

471
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,728
You'll know how flustered

472
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,311
I am by your actions

473
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,230
once you get your memories back.

474
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,374
Why did you catch a cold
when you're home all day long?

475
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,620
My throat hurts, too.

476
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,541
You have to treat it early,
so take medicine before you go.

477
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,710
You want me to die?

478
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,460
It takes over six hours to get to Pohang.

479
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,882
What if I doze off at the wheel?

480
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,723
If you're going to die,
get more insurance before you do.

481
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,299
You and your attitude.

482
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,594
Gosh.

483
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,123
What are you doing? It's winter.

484
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,535
Are you purposely pointing it at me?

485
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,923
I can't drive if I catch a cold.

486
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,842
I'm leaving.

487
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,877
I'm furious at least a dozen times a day

488
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,717
and it's killing me inside.

489
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,762
If you think you're going to die
from fury, get some insurance.

490
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,727
If words could kill,

491
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,148
both of us should've been dead already.

492
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,722
Ji-woo saved the CCTV footage
he saw at the police station,

493
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,470
saying that I have to watch it.

494
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,972
Does he go hiking at night often?

495
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,853
I don't know.

496
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,397
You don't know?

497
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,230
I know, right?

498
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,360
I don't think I know much about my family.

499
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,909
But I remember how you
like kkakdugi and your coffee.

500
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,462
A scientist said

501
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,706
that we know more
about the materials in the solar system

502
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,964
than the materials inside Earth.

503
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,877
We think that there's no need to
learn about Earth since we live on it.

504
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,337
That's how families are.

505
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,430
And judging someone
as Mr. Playboy or whatever

506
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,636
when I don't even know much
about my family

507
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,146
seems pointless too.

508
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,320
How does that relate to this?

509
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,154
I don't know. Do as you wish.

510
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,815
I'm leaving.

511
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,812
I heard it's your day off today.
Why are you here?

512
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,055
Because I have some time.

513
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,061
Is your father home now?

514
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,688
Yes.

515
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,019
Is he in bad condition?

516
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,567
No.

517
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:55,857
No,

518
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,033
He's become a romantic husband.

519
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,621
I thought my parents
need some time on their own,

520
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,792
and I have nowhere to go, so I came here.

521
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,501
I'll leave soon. Don't mind me.

522
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,376
You're shaking your leg.

523
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,878
-What?
-You shake your leg when you're troubled.

524
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:26,982
Why is a CEO being nosy
about an employee's private life?

525
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,856
To the front of the cameraâ¦

526
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,896
What?

527
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,943
Why?

528
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,866
Director Kim, you move the camera.

529
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,700
Treat our employee who's managing
the work of many by herself well, okay?

530
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,212
Okay.

531
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,632
All right, come on.

532
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,086
Get ready.

533
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,730
Aren't they lovely?

534
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,361
I should've worn some make up
when I was their age.

535
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,979
Is wearing too much makeup

536
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,243
and dressing up
to show their figure lovely?

537
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,569
Right, you don't like girly things.

538
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,866
What did you want to talk about?

539
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,535
I'm taking a break starting next week.

540
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,575
Why?

541
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,035
There's a seminar in New Zealand
and I'm attending this time.

542
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,797
We take turns.

543
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:38,965
Should I go with you?

544
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,274
You started working. Do you have time?

545
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,518
Don't worry. I won't go.

546
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,147
Don't be flustered.

547
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,269
I'm busy too.

548
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,902
Do you have to say it like that?

549
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,986
Did you call me during work
and pick me up to tell me this?

550
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,941
Now, now. It's too quiet here.

551
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,566
We're grilling premium beef here.

552
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,282
How about a shot of soju?

553
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,952
Tae-hyung, call a driver.

554
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,701
Eun-joo, what do you say? Ji-woo?

555
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,082
You drink it.

556
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,003
I can't. I have to
go somewhere after I eat.

557
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,038
Where?

558
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,544
To meet someone.

559
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,923
Who are you meeting that you're
covering yourself completely

560
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,001
to keep you from smelling like barbecue?

561
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,300
Perfect. Just perfect.

562
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,014
What?

563
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,432
Someone said you were born
perfect and wonderful.

564
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,892
What an insightful person.

565
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,932
-Eun-joo, put it there.
-Mom, here.

566
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,426
Put it in front of Tae-hyung.

567
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,781
Don't buy meat next time.

568
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,858
Ordering in is the way to let Mom rest.

569
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,493
You think she'll order in?

570
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,030
She told me she will.

571
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,490
Just take your first wrap.

572
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,957
-No, thanks.
-Take it.

573
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,166
Dad did forget his first daughter.

574
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,924
I don't want it.

575
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,126
Goodness.

576
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,176
Dad.

577
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,135
Give me the first wrap from now on.

578
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,011
I'll give it to the head of the family.

579
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,138
Here.

580
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,891
And you give it to the son
who will carry on the family name.

581
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,745
Don't worry too much.

582
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,251
His blood pressure, temperature,
and pulse are normal.

583
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,882
Sir, don't overstrain yourself
and just be comfortable.

584
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,589
Did you hear what Tae-hyung said?

585
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
Yes, doctor.

586
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,353
I meanâ¦

587
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,229
All right.

588
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,388
There are videos that we took

589
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,227
and we have tons of photos, too.

590
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,403
Wouldn't that bring back his memories?

591
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,942
No, don't do that.

592
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,565
Brains work in mysterious ways.

593
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,072
It can create new memories
based on new information.

594
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:55,538
Sir, you're currently in a state
where you're at a vague borderline.

595
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,621
You're going to be yourself soon,

596
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,667
so why don't you enjoy
being a 22-year-old for a while?

597
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,675
-I'll go get the car.
-Okay.

598
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,766
Dad can't work for a while.
Give it to Mom.

599
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,429
She'll reject it if I do.

600
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,265
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,482
What's up with you?

602
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,691
Why are you being
so respectful and polite?

603
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,402
I did?

604
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,156
I can't help but use honorifics
when I see an envelope with money.

605
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,541
Eun-joo, go back home safely.
Bye, Ji-woo.

606
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,623
Are you dating?

607
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,254
Aren't I too old to be asked
if I'm dating or not?

608
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,756
Since you're old now,
be rational in relationships.

609
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,047
You slavishly cater
to the other person in relationships.

610
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,258
You couldn't just skip dating
on a day like today?

611
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,516
-Why rush out this late?
-I'm not dating.

612
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,428
If you can't even call it dating,
then don't go at this hour.

613
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,688
It was better when I didn't see you.

614
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,480
Then don't see me ever again.

615
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,983
You showed up all of a sudden

616
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,935
and you talk like you're being generous.

617
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,985
Is criticism a part of your life?
Isn't your menopause coming too early?

618
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,411
I'm too old to get nitpicked.

619
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,830
Stop it, Eun-hee. Just go.

620
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,539
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

621
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,829
What do you mean? You're fighting again.

622
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,293
"Again"? People might think
we fight every day.

623
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,714
It's not like I'm nagging
on a stranger's love life.

624
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,803
Don't I have the right
to nag at my sister's love life?

625
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,338
Am I wrong, slavish caterer?

626
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,801
No, early menopausal sister.

627
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,881
And you.

628
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,304
What did you say at the dinner table?

629
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,385
"The son who will
carry on the family name"?

630
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,890
We never differentiated son and daughter.

631
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,143
We didn't raise you like that.

632
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,098
Gosh. You two are so alike.

633
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,279
Be rational in relationships.

634
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,323
You slavishly cater
to the other person in relationships.

635
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,366
Slavishly? She went too farâ¦

636
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,498
Goodness.

637
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,077
Her word choices are so annoying.

638
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,264
Darn it, this is so annoying.

639
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,091
You scared me.

640
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,427
You were too drunk that day

641
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,102
to recall my house number, right?

642
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,101
And you don't want to
call me to ask, right?

643
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,101
No.

644
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,515
What's worse is

645
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,234
that you still don't have
my number on your phone.

646
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,490
These thoughts were
in my mind so came down here.

647
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,029
That's not what it is.

648
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,202
I did save your number.

649
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,537
Here.

650
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,919
What did you want to say to me?

651
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,171
Right.

652
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,923
Want to go up and talk?

653
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,295
No.

654
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,138
Let'sâ¦

655
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,810
talk here today.

656
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,152
It seemed like you drink
a lot of coffee at work,

657
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,361
so caffeine-free tea.

658
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,237
Do you only watch me at work?

659
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,697
How did you know?

660
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,549
Hey.

661
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,672
I'm at a cafe near my house.

662
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,545
I'm meeting someone.

663
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,679
Work.

664
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,934
I'm a bit busy.

665
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,644
Good night.

666
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,403
Eun-hee.

667
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,862
I have a girlfriend.

668
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,202
I see.

669
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,615
I've been dating her for a long time.

670
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,123
It's been about nine years.

671
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,458
My first relationship
ended up lasting a long time.

672
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,001
I see.

673
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,507
Nine years.

674
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,091
The first relationship.

675
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,432
Did you hear it from someone else?

676
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,354
Yes.

677
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,063
If I know about it,
everyone at the company knows.

678
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,231
I'm always the last one.

679
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,645
Rumors like that do spread fast.

680
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,153
I understand what you mean.

681
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,480
Let's head out.

682
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:38,988
Wellâ¦

683
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,900
I have something to say.

684
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,618
Didn't you tell me just now?

685
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,580
That wasn't the one.

686
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,785
There's a reasonâ¦

687
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,830
why I didn't call you over the weekend.

688
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,919
I'm sure you couldn't.

689
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,134
It's not that I couldn't. I just didn't.

690
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,014
Because I needed time to think.

691
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,426
And the conclusion I came to
after thinking for a long time isâ¦

692
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,151
I wish to keep seeing you, Eun-hee.

693
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,652
Right.

694
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,251
Thanks.

695
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,538
That feels great.

696
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,754
But I'mâ¦

697
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,747
incapable of being a subject of cheating.

698
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,627
Because I'm not coolheaded enough
to not think much of

699
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,585
you kindly answering
her call in front of me

700
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,886
without even trying

701
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,217
to step outside.

702
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,808
I thought stepping outside
would make you misunderstand more.

703
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,556
We'reâ¦

704
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,728
slowly drifting apart.

705
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,614
First, we saw each other less.

706
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,489
Then, we called each other less.

707
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,407
And nowâ¦

708
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,406
we rarely contact each other.

709
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,162
It may seem cowardly,

710
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,340
but that's what nine years is.

711
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,892
What would Eun-joo say
if she was in this situation?

712
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,522
Did you two agree to slowly drift apart?

713
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,728
How long does "slowly" take?

714
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:39,565
Can you explain the difference
between breaking up and drifting apart?

715
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,401
I want to be honest with you today.

716
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,320
and I wish to keep seeing you, Eun-hee.

717
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,459
CHILBO DRIVER REST STOP

718
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,299
You must've worked like a horse.

719
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,010
The others had to work a lot more
just because you took a few days off.

720
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,431
Is this my truck?

721
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:16,806
Mine?

722
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,443
Sang-sik!

723
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,069
Do you really not remember or what?

724
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,861
What theâ¦

725
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,950
What?

726
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,676
To be frank,

727
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,522
we can't say it's your truck.

728
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,559
Only one of the tires is yours.

729
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,443
The rest is all debt.

730
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,186
Can he drive it?

731
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,897
Why?

732
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,356
His memories aren't back yet.

733
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,236
Come on, as soon as he saw the truck,

734
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,873
he knew where to look and check.

735
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,121
His body remembers.
He can do it with his eyes closed.

736
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,577
By the way, it's not dementia
or anything like that, right?

737
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,961
It's completely different.

738
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,898
Ms. Sook, get in.

739
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:49,032
You can just step on
the foothold and climb up.

740
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,197
Yes. Grab that.

741
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,951
Slowly.

742
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,156
Careful.

743
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,417
You're back to your young days.

744
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,249
You're in your honeymoon days. Good grief.

745
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,683
Are you looking for something?

746
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
No.

747
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,936
It's quite high up here.

748
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,815
Is this your first time riding it?

749
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,779
I bought a truck,

750
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,373
but how come you were never in it before?

751
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:39,037
Is it because you're not
interested in me at all?

752
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,539
Is it because I bought this recently?

753
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:47,043
I've never been in your
company truck either.

754
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,178
Whyâ¦

755
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,758
Why is that?

756
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,539
You'll like the promotional video.

757
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,078
It's well-organized.

758
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,377
She's good at soulless smiles.

759
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,383
You're right.

760
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,934
My second older sister
is a soulless pacifist.

761
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,052
-Please sit.
-Hi.

762
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,966
You know each other, right?

763
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,055
Yes.

764
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,135
She said that releasing
the promotional video first

765
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,098
will help with the publication.

766
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,018
Yes.

767
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,815
You can get the photos
from the video for the book, right?

768
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,070
I can.

769
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:57,861
If you can pay the rest of the fee,
we can even upload the video today.

770
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,032
I see.

771
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,040
-Let's watch it then.
-Yes, hold on.

772
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,632
"Slowly drifting apart."

773
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:16,719
This is a fresh one-liner suggesting
a new perception of two-timing.

774
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,050
He should be able to say those lines
if he's a true Mr. Playboy,

775
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,966
So what are you going to do
with Mr. Playboy?

776
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,643
Eun-hee.

777
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,557
I'll wait until you make your decision.

778
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,476
Someone said that

779
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,316
I slavishly cater
to the other person in relationships.

780
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,069
What do you think?

781
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,241
It's true that you're
good at catering to people.

782
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,485
If done in the right way,
it's your greatest strength.

783
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,408
But the word choice of "slavishly"

784
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,826
is annoyingly extreme.

785
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,504
"Annoyingly extreme," right?

786
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,918
My sister, whom you called
perfect and wonderful,

787
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,093
used that word to me.

788
00:52:56,214 --> 00:53:00,094
Don't you think Eun-joo used an extreme
word to make sure you get a grip?

789
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,466
I was about to fight her,
but since we made up after four years,

790
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,434
I'm just holding back.

791
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,847
Eun-hee.

792
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,845
-The car is out.
-Okay.

793
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,107
You made up after four years?

794
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,442
Didn't I tell you?

795
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,485
When I cut ties with you,

796
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,069
I also cut ties with my sister.

797
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,364
I'm leaving. Bye.

798
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,916
You're even more stupid than I thought.

799
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,830
What?

800
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,458
You cut ties with your sister
because of Jong-pal?

801
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,415
Don't look at me like that.
She was harsh to me at the time.

802
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,047
How was she harsh to you? Let me hear it.

803
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,644
She has never comforted me.

804
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,391
She's never on my side.

805
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,928
I went to see her first,

806
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,265
but she said I was pathetic.

807
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,190
Why do you want me to talk about the past?

808
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,568
Kim Eun-joo just isn't
the comforting type.

809
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,781
Do you know
what the problem with family is?

810
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,611
They don't say what they have to say.

811
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,076
They let it settle until it hardens
when they can just shake it off.

812
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,538
Then suddenly, it explodes one day.

813
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,580
Apologize to your sister properly.

814
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,464
I did.

815
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,513
Even in university, you were easily
agitated whenever Eun-joo was mentioned.

816
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,010
-Was I?
-Yes.

817
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,471
Even when you were drunk, you'd be happy
about everything but your sister.

818
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,470
But it's gotten worse.

819
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,102
Go meditate more and find out why.

820
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,562
Look into your heart.

821
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,598
It's because I'm petty and crooked.

822
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,318
That's what I am saying.
You aren't petty and crooked.

823
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,530
But why are you
only like that to your sister?

824
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,451
The car is out. I'm leaving.

825
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,469
Because we're family

826
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,266
some memories cannot be shaken off.

827
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,267
Because we're family.

828
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,990
WELCOME TO ULSAN METROPOLITAN CITY

829
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:30,622
While flapping its wings

830
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,872
The bright morning takes my song

831
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,916
Heaven's song

832
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,712
And scatters it

833
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,167
Ms. Sook.

834
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,506
You said I'm more charming
than Lee Yong when I sang this.

835
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,178
Do you remember?

836
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,771
Do you remember me doing
a hundred jump ropes every night

837
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,899
because I was becoming a father?

838
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,980
We could see all of Seoul from our house.

839
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,320
How about we take a look?

840
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,028
Do you remember our first house?

841
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,874
I don't remember.

842
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,662
So just be careful with your driving.

843
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,932
Ms. Sook, please wait just a moment.

844
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,321
Hey, be careful.

845
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:46,318
-It's dangerous to do that alone.
-Yes. I can't pull this.

846
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,538
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

847
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,908
You need to tie it well.

848
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,374
I guess it's tough
to put food on the table.

849
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,248
Considering how his body knows
even without memories.

850
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,340
Is it good enough?

851
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,238
How are you so strong
after staying up a few days?

852
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,735
I slept whenever I had time.

853
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,815
You should've rested while you were out.

854
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,829
I slacked off in my spare time.

855
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,160
Did something bad happen?

856
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,883
About 25 years ago?

857
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,749
Something bad happened then.

858
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,507
I see.

859
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:52,589
If it was 25 years ago,
you were a minor at the time,

860
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,468
so don't drink at the get-together.

861
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,677
I have a counselor's certificate.

862
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:01,185
If you don't drink and drive to my house,

863
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,939
I can do healthy counseling for a minor.

864
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,653
Since you didn't say no yetâ¦

865
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,823
I'm sorry.

866
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,531
I wasn't myself
these past few days, so I missed it.

867
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,912
I'll correct it.

868
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,026
I'll organize it
as soon as possible and submit it.

869
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,578
Okay, I'll be waiting.

870
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,950
Mr. Oh?

871
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,578
Eun-hee has been
working late recently to plan this.

872
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,996
Did you give her more work?

873
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,205
You're so mean.

874
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:33,297
Also, "I'll correct it." "I'll submit it."

875
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,644
Mr. Oh, doesn't this
make you uncomfortable?

876
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,761
Right.

877
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,558
Maybe she's being sarcastic.

878
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,732
"I'm going to do it when I want to do it,
so you just need to wait."

879
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,942
That's what I heard.

880
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,526
You have good hearing.

881
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,486
I'll wait, quietly.

882
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,870
Answer him.

883
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,740
Yes, sir.

884
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,917
"Maybe she's being sarcastic."

885
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,842
He's totally criticizing you, right?

886
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,632
Yes, he's criticizing me.

887
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,972
But don't be so sad.

888
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:22,813
He acts sweet but makes
our team work like a horse too.

889
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,312
Hey, but he still knew
that you were working outside

890
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,106
during lunch on purpose.

891
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:33,359
And he even set aside a lunch box for you,
just in case you skipped lunch.

892
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,950
Really?

893
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,029
Yes.

894
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,493
Fix it with that three-minute one
and send it quickly.

895
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,996
Jeez, all right.

896
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,843
Hello, ma'am.

897
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,498
-So you know her.
-Yes.

898
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,917
-Coming back from lunch?
-Yes, Seo-young will be here soon.

899
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,505
He's a new employee.

900
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,313
Hi, I'm Kim Ji-woo.

901
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,847
You must think I'm a helicopter mother
who comes to her daughter's workplace.

902
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,266
No, of course not.

903
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,105
Seo-young's phone is almost
always off, so I had to come.

904
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,111
Yes, we do a lot of filming here.

905
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,953
I heard it's common
to have your phones off.

906
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,207
I'm sorry. Don't mind us,
and go back to work, please.

907
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,758
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye.

908
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:37,881
Aren't you hereâ¦

909
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,675
to say something to me?

910
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,719
Yes, get up.
Let's go to the cafe out front.

911
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,267
You can say it here.

912
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,111
How can I do that? Everyone's working.

913
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,229
I have to work, too.

914
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,199
Get up, Seo-young. It won't take long.

915
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,072
Mr. Park.

916
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,866
How about we have lunch together?

917
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,825
Yes, sure.

918
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,078
After suffering such a thing,

919
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,826
how can you work with a bunch of men?

920
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,750
"Such a thing"?

921
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,593
I suffered it?

922
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,474
Ji-woo, wait for me. I'm hungry, too.

923
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,183
What are you doing?
Don't give others a hard time.

924
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,524
I hate it.

925
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,942
I hate it so much!

926
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,613
You're terrible at lying.

927
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,867
Asking me to lunch
after coming from lunch?

928
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,326
I was startled.

929
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,451
How do you know her?

930
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,666
I just do.

931
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,919
I'm sure all mothers
and daughters are like that.

932
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,672
They fight and laugh.

933
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,554
My mom and sisters aren't like that.

934
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,140
You'll never know
since you grew up in a normal family.

935
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,888
I thought my family
was normal, but we're not.

936
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,653
Let's do well at the book fair.
Good job, everyone!

937
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:23,315
-Good job!
-Good job!

938
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,259
It's so refreshing.

939
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,514
No way.

940
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,472
My sister does look old.

941
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,515
She hasn't changed much.

942
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,229
Give it to your sister.

943
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,139
I'm sending her this now.

944
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,104
Why not give it to her yourself?

945
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,568
Someone told me she might get
the wrong idea if I give it to her myself.

946
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,238
Come on, Eun-hee won't get
any wrong ideas from you.

947
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,284
Yoon Seo-young.

948
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,741
Answer me.

949
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,408
Say it.

950
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,618
Go home. I'll do the first editing.

951
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,457
If you feeling down,
go have a drink with your co-worker.

952
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,853
Chan-hyuk.

953
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,393
I feel insulted.

954
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,845
She doesn't want to drink with me?

955
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,265
-Correct.
-Chan-hyuk!

956
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,081
-Where are we going?
-What?

957
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,868
Do you know any bars we can go to?

958
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:58,984
Why?

959
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,649
-Do you want more coffee?
-No.

960
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,360
You have something to say, right?

961
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,359
No.

962
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,987
You're lying.

963
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,657
I think you have something to say.

964
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,868
Why are you glancing at me
and not saying anything these days?

965
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,285
It's my job to glance

966
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,789
to check if my customers need anything.

967
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,087
I see.

968
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,380
So the old woman got the wrong idea

969
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,384
because the handsome
barista kept glancing.

970
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,510
I need a piece of cheesecake
to get myself together.

971
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,603
Orange cheesecake.

972
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,853
Let's have dinner.

973
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,345
You're early.

974
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,267
Cancel the cheesecake.

975
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,475
Okay.

976
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:46,404
You've been eating cake
as a meal these days. Go have dinner.

977
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:51,566
You're a very observant
and polite barista.

978
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,954
Get your purse.

979
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,454
Okay.

980
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,628
Bye.

981
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,612
You said we're going to eat.

982
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,902
Let's walk for a bit.

983
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,398
Okay.

984
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,123
I think I should tell you

985
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,539
before I go to the seminar.

986
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,958
Sure, go ahead.

987
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,181
I really liked this walking trail.

988
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,514
A rich neighborhood sure felt different.

989
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,684
I never even dreamed
I would live in a such place.

990
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:05,861
So?

991
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,438
Just say what you have to say.

992
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,529
You always asked if
I had something to say,

993
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,703
but I'm nervous now that you do.

994
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,549
You talk like you're
going to leave this place.

995
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,259
What do you think I'll say?

996
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:35,802
I know, right?

997
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,676
I guess at some point

998
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,224
I started to feel
that I would leave this neighborhood.

999
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,685
Stop dragging it and say it.

1000
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,163
Sang-sik!

1001
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,043
Mr. Kim.

1002
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,633
Gosh, we were so worried.

1003
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,545
I'm sorry I made you all worry.

1004
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,432
I feel light as a feather.

1005
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,932
We were struggling without you,
our problem solver.

1006
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,523
That's right, I'm the best problem solver.

1007
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,890
-You look great.
-Right.

1008
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,397
Are you all doing fine?

1009
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,689
-Yes.
-I see.

1010
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,988
I only rode it once, but it's so tiring.

1011
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,867
All jobs in this world are hard.

1012
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,131
Why are you waiting here?
The air here isn't good.

1013
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,096
So I can see you sooner.

1014
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,848
Sang-sik, take all the time
you need to rest.

1015
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,266
You can lend your truck.

1016
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,392
It's not easy to leave it to someone else.

1017
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:52,897
Gosh, you're so picky.

1018
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,153
I'll leave it here,

1019
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:59,493
so pay the double amount
if you want to borrow it.

1020
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,200
The double amount, no matter what.

1021
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:02,911
Are you leaving?

1022
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,490
Of course, I am.

1023
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,041
Oh.

1024
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,458
Is there anything else left for me to do?

1025
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,470
Sang-sik, you're being weird today.

1026
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:21,974
What?

1027
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,552
What's so weird about me?

1028
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,472
Arenât you going to see Young-sik?

1029
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,104
Young-sik?

1030
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,359
Right.

1031
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,362
Young-sik.

1032
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,112
Yes, Young-sik.

1033
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,742
Dad!

1034
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:56,708
Dad.

1035
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,718
I knewâ¦

1036
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,483
that this day would come.

1037
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,903
I've always imagined it.

1038
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,141
Were you with Mr. Playboy?

1039
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,095
It's because I'm embarrassed.

1040
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,353
Eun-hee.

1041
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,774
Family members trick each other.

1042
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,103
Where did Mom go?

1043
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,895
He's on a date.

1044
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:45,031
I cried every night, but you came home
with wildflowers in your hand.

1045
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,320
I was cold and hungry every day.

1046
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,823
But I think you should know, too.

1047
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,906
I remember everything.

1048
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:54,406
You tried to commit suicide with me.

1049
01:12:55,704 --> 01:13:00,714
