131
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,509
I mean, I was receiving
duplicate information

from two different officers
in the healthcare center.

Mr. Keller, are you aware of the
new procedures instigated by HQ?

Barfield is severely lacking
in trained negotiating officers.

In a prison of this size, that
should have been a priority.

as soon as I was informed
we had a hostage situation.

Now, that was not...

140
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,234
Mr. Keller, we are not here
to apportion any blame.

141
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,105
Miss Hewitt has kindly agreed
to join us again.

142
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,077
As you know,
she was instrumental

in releasing Mr. Morgan,

144
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,241
so she is obviously familiar
with siege and hostage training.

HEWITT: I'm sure it didn't,

since he was threatening
to kill the hostage,

and according to this report,

209

there was a belief that
he would carry out that threat.

to the side of his neck,

had been tied 'round it.

a care-bear support team?

00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,106
Just to aggravate you, son.

312
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,618
- Any word on S.O. Morgan?
- Nope, not since I've been here.

313
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,951
- Come on, Eugene.
- All right, Bri!

314
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,287
Oswald Snooper!
Back to your cell, please.

315
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,452
Yo, gov.
I've got a complaint.

316
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,538
They're serving the wrong food
on the wrong day here.

317
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,030
You, you should be pleased,
mate.

318
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,622
You always complain
about the boredom.

319
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,739
This is keeping you happy.

320
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,029
Piss off.

321
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,433
Oh! Oh, oh.
That's funny.

322
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,232
SMITH: Woof!

323
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,603
Oi, Eugene,
has he got it in for me?

324
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,574
Why does he keep on
calling out my name?

325
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,975
I don't know.
It's your name, innit? Jason.

326
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,044
Yeah, right.

327
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,890
[Mockingly] Why does
he keep calling out my name?

328
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:12,716
So I stayed with Mrs. Morgan...
Uh, her name's Nora...

329
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,381
Until, well, very late.

330
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,049
Well, until her husband
was released.

331
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,615
And you haven't seen her again?

332
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,389
No, I-I said she should call me
if she needed me.

333
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,022
And you haven't spoken
to Senior Officer Morgan

334
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,430
since the incident?

335
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,627
No, no, I haven't, actually.

336
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,261
Um, well,
he's a very experienced officer

337
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,273
and I doubt if there's anything
to be unduly worried about.

338
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm sure there isn't.

339
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,470
But, you know, there should be
a hostage-support scheme.

340
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,014
Well, there isn't one, is there?

341
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,949
Well, no, uh, I don't think so.

342
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,883
Um, well, I do agree.

343
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,513
One should have been instigated
by Mr. Keller.

344
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,822
He hasn't exactly instilled, um,
too much confidence.

345
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,362
There was a lot of ill feeling
about his delaying

346
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,762
coming to grips
with this hostage situation.

347
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,391
Well, thanks for the coffee.

348
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,231
On the day
of the hostage incident,

349
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,033
Governor Keller
was at a management conference.

350
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,437
Really?

351
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,907
And they usually take place

352
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:13,106
on the ninth hole
of a golf course, do they?

353
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,239
According to all the reports
the doctor,

354
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,014
even without much experience,
proved to be an able negotiator.

355
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,086
The perpetrator,

356
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,488
according to the control room
log and the incident area log,

357
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,618
refused to speak to any of
the negotiators, full stop.

358
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,457
Said he didn't trust them.

359
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,054
Now, possibly
if I hadn't have arrived,

360
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,257
they would have provided him

361
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,976
with the blow-up rubber dolly
he requested.

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,060
I am only here to ensure

363
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,627
that should such an incident
occur again,

364
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,264
then any mistakes that were made
will be rectified.

365
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,070
If you've anything
further to add...

366
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,873
Yes, you could start by making
all prison staff more aware

367
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,675
of the hostage
and siege programs.

368
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,547
Perhaps you could even get
the acting governor

369
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,073
to take a refresher course, hmm?

370
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,086
Do you want to know
where S.O. Russell Morgan is?

371
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,247
He's in
the emergency psychiatric ward

372
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,553
of the local hospital.

373
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,990
Now, you'd better take

374
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,221
my accusations seriously,
Mr. Bunny,

375
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,424
or I'll have every governor,
officer, at Barfield Prison

376
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,433
to sign a petition
and vote him out.

377
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,093
Just calm down.

378
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,694
This isn't gonna be
brushed under the carpet.

379
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,640
If HQ try it,
you'll have a riot.

380
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,439
Only not from the inmates.

381
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,109
If there is to be a petition,
then I think my observations

382
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,846
should be
taken into consideration.

383
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,889
Perhaps you have
a personal motive, Miss Hewitt?

384
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,324
This isn't personal.
That is my professional opinion.

385
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Just as I presume
that you had no personal motive

386
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,392
when you felt
that I was too inexperienced

387
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,797
to continue running Barfield.

388
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,294
Well, I hope you don't retain

389
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,272
any personal motives against me,
Mr. Bunny.

390
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,036
Your own inexperience
in handling a siege situation

391
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,442
might possibly
come under scrutiny.

392
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,209
You'll get copies of my report.
Good morning.

393
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,305
Morning.

394
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,656
Full of herself, isn't she?

395
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,216
There's a vote of no confidence,
Gordon,

396
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,558
and I don't think I can stop it.

397
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,427
Or her.

398
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,162
SAMORA: Tarzan!

399
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,531
[Men singing indistinctly]

400
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,034
Tarzan!
Tarzan, it's me... Brian.

401
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,771
You remember me.
I was in the block with you.

402
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,484
We're doing a musical.
They've got... aah!

403
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,243
Aah! Eugene!
He's pulling me hair out!

404
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,580
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Glasses!

405
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,586
No one's scared of you, Tarzan!

406
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,053
- [Glass breaks]
- Oh!

407
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,454
- Oh, your glasses, Eugene!
- Jesus.

408
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,253
Broken.
Your new glasses.

409
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,055
Get a move on!
Show's over.

410
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,254
Bastards.

411
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,524
I'll be glad when I get out of
this shithole!

412
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,032
Be glad when you go as well.
Your moaning and your whingeing.

413
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,034
You'll be sick
when I'm gone, Eugene.

414
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,296
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

415
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,271
You'll be sick about me too,
because in two weeks, I gone.

416
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,365
Yeah, man, we'll meet up
and have a curry.

417
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,000
- Boom!
- Yes, boy!

418
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,675
Thank you.

419
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,946
Hello.

420
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,284
Been a long time.
Do sit down.

421
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,288
Thank you.

422
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,984
Can I offer you some coffee
or tea?

423
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,994
No.
Nothing, thank you.

424
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,360
Did you enjoy your time
in the United States?

425
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,693
Well, I don't whether "enjoy"

426
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,642
is quite the word I would've
used to describe it,

427
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,786
but it was very informative.

428
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,826
I've been back
almost six months.

429
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,596
You must be aware
of why you're here.

430
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,038
Mm-hmm.

431
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,908
Governor Keller implemented
a number of changes,

432
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,244
some of which were not
as successful as others,

433
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,307
and Barfield
could possibly be market tested.

434
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,447
Um, this is
not yet public knowledge,

435
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,458
but Governor Keller
has resigned,

436
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,120
and until
we have time to replace him,

437
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,255
the position
of governor of Barfield

438
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,664
would be a transitory posting.

439
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,465
Mr. Andrews,

440
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,337
I'm obviously very grateful
for the research opportunities,

441
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,807
and teaching
at the training college

442
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,036
has been very satisfactory,

443
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,012
but I am not interested
in any transitory posting.

444
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,012
No, no, no.

445
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,207
I-I think we're slightly

446
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,943
at cross purposes here,
Miss Hewitt.

447
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,486
I'm not offering you
a transitory post.

448
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,812
Oh.

449
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,687
With your experience
and interest

450
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,268
in the psychology
of serious offenders,

451
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,491
together with your training
in the U.S.,

452
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,361
I want to ask you to take over

453
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,833
the psychology department
of Barfield.

454
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,038
Um...

455
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,543
Uh, I misunderstood.

456
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,443
[Laughs]

457
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,577
Uh, Mr. Andrews, I don't want to
head any psychology department.

458
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,087
I would have liked
to have returned to Barfield

459
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,454
as governor,
not on any transitory contract,

460
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,584
but with a guarantee
that I would be there

461
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,252
for a minimum of three years.

462
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,956
Well, there is a short list
being drawn up.

463
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,731
I'm sorry, Mr. Andrews.

464
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,464
But your offer clearly indicates

465
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,476
where you feel my experience

Miss Hewitt, we've had a rape.

Is it possible
for you to come to Barfield?

No. Sorry.

But you were called in
over the hostage situation.

That was different.

We've had a woman raped, and
we can't contact Dr. Williams.

- Not right now.
- I'm afraid it's Mr. Morgan.

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,750
Yeah. He said he came back
for a clean shirt.

Look, he's very angry.
He keeps punching the locker.

793

Can't get through to him.

794

You can't be rational with him.

795
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,336
It's really upset me I'm sorry.

What are you playing at,
you silly bastard?

You'll get them all worried sick

I have got to pick myself up

I needed a clean shirt.

Well, have you got one?

809

Yeah, I've got
a clean shirt now, Gary.

I always have one in my locker.

I didn't come on the bike today.

No, I haven't.

Who was involved?

It was a Miss Bullock.

833

She's locked herself
in her office.

And she refused to give
a statement to the police.

00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,627
So I suggest
you contact Miss Hewitt

Well, you know how cheerful
he always was.

You see,
there were no eyewitnesses.

And since you do not wish
to press charges,

979
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,888
Mr. Snooper therefore
cannot be charged with assault.

is that Mr. Snooper
