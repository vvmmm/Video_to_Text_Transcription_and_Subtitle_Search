FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,372
{\an8}Come slowly.

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,367
{\an8}You might fall.

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,418
{\an8}I have to go home today.

6
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,091
{\an8}To celebrate Dad's return home.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,250
{\an8}It won't be long.

8
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,667
{\an8}Let's drink something.

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,836
{\an8}You have something to tell me, right?

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,930
On Eun-joo's wedding day,

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,107
I saw some facial expressions
and realized that there are things

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,819
that can't be expressed in photos.

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,199
The facial expressions
of your mother and father.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,240
Eun-joo was the star of the day,

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,740
but I was observing them
and taking their photos.

16
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,617
My mom and dad?

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,748
Yes.

18
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:29,132
Actually, I recently saw
that my mom has a photo of my dad.

19
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,638
It was unexpected, so I was surprised.

20
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,654
This?

21
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,739
Why is this photo on your phone?

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,360
I like this photo.

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,119
So I told Ji-woo to give it to them.

24
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,745
Why?

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,382
You've always said that your parents
live together because of the kids,

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,000
and they hate each other.

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,299
But Iâ¦

28
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,011
didn't feel that at Eun-joo's wedding.

29
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,297
Thenâ¦

30
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,347
what did you feel?

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,599
Wellâ¦

32
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,389
It's complicated.

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,113
"I know how you've been living

34
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,321
to be standing here today."

35
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,948
"Only I know."

36
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,159
Those eyes.

37
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,831
Those eyes deeper than love.

38
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,832
I'm sure they didn't hate each other

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,293
or stay together because of the kids.

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,086
Send me this photo too.

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,142
But why are you
bringing that up all of a sudden?

42
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,764
I don't know.

43
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,387
I think your mother is very wise.

44
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,475
Whatever your mother says today,

45
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,356
listen to her.

46
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,650
Okay.

47
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,986
But I guess I do know a lot about you.

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,540
I don't think you're
telling me everything.

49
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,634
There must be a reason, right?

50
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,761
All right.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,130
I have to go.

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,679
Let's go.

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,059
How can holding hands
be this heart-fluttering?

54
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,392
You won't say that
if you're actually fluttered.

55
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,608
I think you're in friend mode.

56
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,438
Chan-hyuk, I'll be good to you.

57
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,784
I love it.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,950
How do you feel?

59
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,662
Did you calm yourself down?

60
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,828
A bit.

61
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,746
When someone approaches you

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,797
and says, "I know what's troubling you,
I know what you want,"

63
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,209
don't hold onto them.

64
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,755
There's no such thing.

65
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,801
You might've started it
with affectionate love,

66
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,386
but I'm sure you know how you feel.

67
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,222
You held on because she was easy.

68
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,562
Did you think you could just leave?

69
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,904
No.

70
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,818
I regretted it after writing that too.

71
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,899
I also thought I could just leave.

72
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,407
Without even knowing
how scary those words are.

73
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
I got divorced.

74
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,126
Thinking about it,

75
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,878
there were things
I didn't tell you, like this.

76
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,171
I think it was because
you are the youngest.

77
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,844
Let's start sharing things from now on.

78
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,927
We both made a mistake

79
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,183
and let's not repeat these mistakes.

80
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,938
Since Eun-hee has arrived, I'm going too.

81
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,977
Buy a cake before you come.

82
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,583
Being unable to take things easily
is a good change too.

83
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,093
Mom, I'm here.

84
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,768
Mom.

85
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,103
It's a gift.

86
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,108
It's the same one I gave my sisters.

87
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,777
Mom, I'll put it on for you.

88
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,657
No, thanks.

89
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,865
Follow me.

90
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,789
Mom, light the candles on the cake.

91
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,087
For Dad's return home.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,760
Don't do that.

93
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,961
What is family?

94
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,078
What is a familyâ¦

95
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,457
to you?

96
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,261
I'm asking because I really don't know.

97
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,394
You guys don't know either?

98
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,477
Orâ¦

99
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,520
have you never thought about it?

100
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,112
When youâ¦

101
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,244
cut ties with Eun-joo,

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,865
I was wondering, "What happened?"

103
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,754
"Is her heart filled with hard feelings?"

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,790
I was worried sick alone for years.

105
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,710
Did you know?

106
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,636
When youâ¦

107
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,807
announced your divorce
without consulting me

108
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,022
about it,

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,940
I just accepted it.

110
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,568
And It's still breaking my heart.

111
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,318
Did you know?

112
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,119
Youâ¦

113
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,669
Do youâ¦

114
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,631
Do you even knowâ¦

115
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,639
what you have done?

116
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,985
Momâ¦

117
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,418
Get out.

118
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,091
Your momâ¦

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,720
will have nothing to do with you anymore.

120
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,218
I'm going to make her.

121
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,272
Didn't you hear me?

122
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,190
Get out!

123
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,728
Don't do that.

124
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,526
I can't kick him out.

125
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,315
I know

126
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,620
because I've been kicked out.

127
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,708
I know how scary that is,

128
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,004
so I can never do that.

129
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,094
I will not kick you out,
so answer me at least.

130
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,927
Do you knowâ¦

131
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,274
what you have doneâ¦

132
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,848
to me?

133
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,531
Mom, I'm sorry.

134
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,571
Even if someone rented
that room for one or two years,

135
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,789
I'm sure that someone
wouldn't have left like you did.

136
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,003
Youâ¦

137
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,288
Why did you do that?

138
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,593
Mom.

139
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,090
Dad.

140
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,798
I'm sureâ¦

141
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,046
he doesn't really know what he did wrong.

142
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,795
He must've left with the thought

143
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,597
of going to a foreign country
with no one else there

144
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,101
to live freely.

145
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,933
It means that we were a burden to him.

146
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,153
When all of my family immigrated overseas,

147
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,907
I had nowhere to go when things were hard.

148
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,330
"Mom, Dad."

149
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,368
"Things are so hard for me."

150
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,703
"I can't live."

151
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,629
I had no one to hold onto or vent to.

152
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,171
It was so miserableâ¦

153
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,838
I cried a lot at the time.

154
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,728
But youâ¦

155
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,850
Did you want to fly to a place
with no family

156
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,646
and live freely

157
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,606
all by yourself?

158
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,276
Mom also had her mom

159
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,493
and her family.

160
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,462
I forgot about that.

161
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,183
Go bring the cake.

162
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,357
Your father got discharged
after a big surgery,

163
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,690
so congratulate him.

164
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,580
Mom.

165
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,239
I'm so sorry.

166
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,540
I'm really sorry.

167
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,331
I will never do that again.

168
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,498
Please forgive me.

169
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,421
Mom, I really am sorry.

170
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,716
How can he do that?

171
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,093
You've never done that, huh?

172
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,927
Because I don't do anything wrong.

173
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,466
You're disgusting.

174
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,234
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,028
Mom, I'm so sorry.

176
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,649
I canât live without you.

177
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,485
All right.

178
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,243
I'm going to be born
the youngest in my next life.

179
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,586
Dad, blow out the candles.

180
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,554
Dad, blow out the candles, come on.

181
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,467
Welcome home!

182
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,063
Yay!

183
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,352
Welcome home, Dad.

184
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,027
Mom.

185
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,576
The gift.

186
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Mom, I'll put it on for you.

187
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,916
How pretty.

188
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,804
We shouldn't have covered it up so easily.

189
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,553
That was the problem every time.

190
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,272
Her anger isn't going to
melt away that easily,

191
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,524
so let's comfort her in our own ways.

192
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,783
Bye.

193
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,275
I brought my car key.

194
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,993
Eun-joo, I'll take you.

195
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,583
Did you bring your car?

196
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,368
Come on, it'd be uncomfortable
for him to go back in now.

197
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,582
He's giving them time
to have a conversation.

198
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,754
Are you dating someone?

199
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,422
Seriously.

200
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm too old to be asked
if I'm dating someone or not.

201
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,877
Stop asking me that, okay?

202
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,094
I think I saw this moment before.

203
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,390
Eun-joo, I'll take you.

204
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:55,522
He wasn't just the youngest
who doesnât think much.

205
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,313
He's old enough too.

206
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,146
He should know

207
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,191
how serious his actions were.

208
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,449
You're here alone?

209
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,790
Ji-woo isnât coming.

210
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,997
Ms. Lee Jin-sook's generosity
is at another level,

211
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,916
so he didn't get kicked out.

212
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,471
You.

213
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,969
You knew that my mom knew, right?

214
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,797
How did you know?

215
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,353
Iâ¦

216
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,228
met your mother.

217
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,772
You met my mom?

218
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,103
You met her alone?

219
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,818
She asked me
if Ji-woo did go on a business trip,

220
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,491
and I couldn't lie to her.

221
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,867
All mothers in the world
know everything about their children.

222
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,989
I forgot about that old divine truth.

223
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,248
She didn't really ask me to keep a secret,

224
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,870
but I decided not to tell anyone

225
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,288
until she told everyone.

226
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,915
So you came to see me

227
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,585
to tell me to listen to her?

228
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,466
Then what can I do?
I hate keeping secrets from you.

229
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,637
At that momentâ¦

230
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,516
I was on your mother's side.

231
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,861
I love you.

232
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,703
The words I've been keeping
for a long time

233
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,204
almost popped out.

234
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,039
Why are youâ¦

235
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,424
looking at me with those eyes?

236
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,668
Wellâ¦

237
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,796
You alwaysâ¦

238
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,802
At all timesâ¦

239
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,846
You keep secrets so well.

240
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,104
You're everyone's private safe.

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,024
No. You're suddenly
blushing and acting weird.

242
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,272
I'm blushing?

243
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,742
What could it be?

244
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,580
Are you okay?

245
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,955
Me?

246
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
Why would I be?

247
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,843
Mr. Kim Sang-sik.

248
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,806
I'm so scared
whenever you call me that now.

249
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,219
Don't get angry.

250
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,387
Do you think I lost it?

251
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,439
Why would I get angry at you now?

252
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,935
I decided to sell Lucky.

253
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,070
How did you know about Lucky?

254
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,370
I guess you completely forgotâ¦

255
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,946
that you used to call me Lucky

256
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,327
when I was pregnant

257
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,423
with Eun-joo.

258
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,001
No.

259
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,876
That's not what I'm saying.

260
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,047
You can't drive anymore.

261
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,428
But if you keep on being
stubborn and continue driving,

262
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,144
I canât stop you.

263
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,561
No one can stop your stubbornness.

264
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,612
All right.

265
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,859
I'll quit driving.

266
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,332
Earlier onâ¦

267
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,710
even when my heart was breaking,

268
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,749
I was concerned about our kids and you.

269
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,128
Why were you concerned about me?

270
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,092
I guess that's how
I've been living my life.

271
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,392
I've never thought this but today,

272
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,729
I disliked my kids.

273
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,649
My goodness.

274
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,232
How can a mother

275
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,067
dislike her kids?

276
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,952
My heart sunk.

277
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,669
Gosh.

278
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,296
You idiot.

279
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,085
You absolute idiot.

280
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,649
The problem is it's not over.

281
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,109
I was going to reveal everything today,

282
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,650
but I just left.

283
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,153
Chills ran down my spine.

284
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,864
It's not over?

285
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,494
Is your family an onion?
It just keeps peeling.

286
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,872
It's not one hundred percent true.

287
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,289
If Mom finds out that Ji-woo
was conned and lost moneyâ¦

288
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,130
"Ji-woo worked so hard
to save up that money,

289
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,800
and what have you been doing
when he was being conned?"

290
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,802
If she finds out the true reason
for Eun-joo's divorceâ¦

291
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,224
"Fraudulent marriage?"

292
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,223
"Eun-hee, lead the way!"

293
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,015
"How dare they
do that to my precious daughter!"

294
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,139
"This is a crime!"

295
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,807
"Why didn't you tell me?"

296
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,726
I'll be the one to take all the blame.

297
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,569
I love you.

298
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,630
What's with your face?

299
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,252
What?

300
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,755
It's red right here.

301
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,433
Here?

302
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,813
I'm fine.

303
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,824
-Hi.
-Patent Attorney Kim.

304
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,236
Hi.

305
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,494
Good morning.

306
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,090
Excuse me. I'm getting off too.

307
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,385
-Don't you need to go up a floor?
-I have business with Attorney Kim.

308
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,470
Attorney Kim.

309
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,479
Attorney Kim.

310
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,350
It's not ready yet,

311
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,937
but you came early.

312
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,192
Yes.

313
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,490
My sister

314
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,947
told me what she heard at the lounge.

315
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,617
I heard you stood up for me
when people were badmouthing me.

316
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,248
I did?

317
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,207
I heard you took my side
when they talked about my divorce

318
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,632
and changed the subject.

319
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,090
Thatâ¦

320
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,132
I find it boring to talk about
someone who's not there.

321
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,636
Is that standing up for you?

322
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,642
I don't beat around the bush,
so Iâll tell you directly.

323
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,811
Someone who just got divorced

324
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,476
feels uncomfortable

325
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,784
when defended and treated nicely too.

326
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,188
The most considerate thing to do
is to do nothing.

327
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,857
Divorce is different from a breakup.

328
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,992
Okay, I see.

329
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,912
Well, Iâ¦

330
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,497
Right nowâ¦

331
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,958
I'm here to receive
the additional delivery charges.

332
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,883
I'm afraid you might complain again
if I pay for that, soâ¦

333
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,553
Okay.

334
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,635
Tell me how much it is.

335
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,138
Yes, this is the receipt
I got after I paid for it.

336
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,561
Here's my bank information.

337
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,349
GARAM BANK, YOO MIN-WOO

338
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,852
Isn't it precise?

339
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,766
I got scolded a lot by you
for not being precise back in the day,

340
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,566
so I'm now more meticulous.

341
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,818
Okay. I'll send you the money right away.

342
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,781
Patent Attorney Kim.

343
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,695
Yes.

344
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,081
Don't you remember that?

345
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,120
Iâ¦

346
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,665
I've always been on your side
since we were trainees,

347
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,579
and I've always been nice to you.

348
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,088
But I thought it'd be weirder
if I'm awkward with you

349
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,170
just because you just got divorced,

350
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,926
so I'm being the same,
as I have always been.

351
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,598
So, don't be uncomfortable
with your co-trainee as well.

352
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,148
You said almost the same thing back then

353
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,808
and you apologized later,
saying you made a mistake.

354
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,462
Lucky hasn't been sold yet, huh?

355
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,962
There's a long line of people
wanting to buy it.

356
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,674
Butâ¦

357
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,974
You need to stamp the paperwork.

358
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,183
Sang-sik.

359
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,263
You need to quit.

360
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,642
I'm going to quit soon too.

361
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,730
I've learned from seeing you.

362
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,861
Family comes first, not money.

363
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,566
Want to do business together?

364
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,911
With your wife's kimchi,
it would be a big success.

365
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,618
I made her suffer all her life,
and you want me to make her sell kimchi

366
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,370
because I can't drive a truck now?

367
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,866
Why are you yelling?

368
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,754
That scared me.

369
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,632
Still, I was worried about you.

370
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,296
But it's a relief that
the surgery went well.

371
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,670
I'm going to drive a forklift
at the plant,

372
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,678
and get a license for operating
an overhead crane.

373
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,642
What the heck?

374
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,851
So you had plans already?

375
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,805
Your wife

376
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,316
cried a lot
after collecting your things from Lucky.

377
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,362
You should've stopped her.

378
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,244
You let her see all of it?

379
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,413
How can I stop her from doing that?

380
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,287
She cried so much

381
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,168
that her eyes were swollen
by the time she left,

382
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,960
so I was wondering if she could see.

383
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,536
Okay, here we go. Smile.

384
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,371
One, twoâ¦

385
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,462
Give me a big smile.

386
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,048
I feel relaxed. It's amazing.

387
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,335
It feels like I'm resting.

388
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,894
Let'sâ¦

389
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,760
give it a shot.

390
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,845
"I love you" is such a common expression,

391
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,529
but I didn't say that to the one I love.

392
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,547
Are you going to be alone like this?

393
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,758
My beloved Kyung-ok.
Were you lonely because I was gone?

394
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,434
Beloved? Come on.

395
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,774
You don't like me.

396
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,350
No, that's not true.

397
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,559
I didn't spread rumors

398
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,976
about you and the vice CEO, okay?

399
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,611
That's not something that can be hidden.

400
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,913
The vice CEO's eyes
were sparkling with hearts.

401
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,988
That was a long time ago.

402
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,985
It was my fault.

403
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,287
Forget about it.

404
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,035
I read in a book

405
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,384
that people tend to be nicer

406
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,629
to those they don't really like

407
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,592
and waste more energy on them.

408
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,137
That's what you do.

409
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,561
You always tell your co-workers

410
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,180
that you love them.

411
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:12,398
I, too, heard that
you love me too many times.

412
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,243
I know, right?

413
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,988
I did that.

414
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,237
And as for youâ¦

415
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,282
You need to stop wasting money.

416
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,736
Stop treating people.

417
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:28,366
That's the joy of my life.
Don't tell me to stop doing that.

418
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,310
Can you drop me off here?

419
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,605
What?

420
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,491
Thanks.

421
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,343
-He's taking too long.
-What?

422
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,052
Just drive safely.

423
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,030
Hey.

424
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,432
I love you, Park Chan-hyuk.

425
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,767
All the "I love you" that I said
for 35 years can't beat this one.

426
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,693
Nowâ¦

427
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,816
Right nowâ¦

428
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,280
I love you.

429
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,041
I love you.

430
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,367
Fast food.

431
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,740
Fast food?

432
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,510
I treasure Ji-woo
like he's my own brother,

433
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,890
and I like Eun-joo and am polite to her

434
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,098
because ofâ¦

435
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
you.

436
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,235
I forgot to say something important.

437
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,986
About what I said earlier.

438
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,914
I promised myself to tell

439
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,618
the story to the person
that would be by my side forever.

440
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,970
I'll call you.

441
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,548
I have to do it. What are you saying?

442
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,644
It's my turn today.

443
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,866
More.

444
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,663
Turn to the left more.

445
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,077
The angle isn't right.

446
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,042
Isn't there a rear camera?

447
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,878
Driver.

448
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,929
Are you going to kill
the onlooker with frustration or smog?

449
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,352
Hey.

450
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,854
Come in.

451
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,562
Keep going.

452
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,817
Now slowly take your foot off the brake.

453
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,190
Step on it. That's it.

454
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,372
Yes!

455
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,182
Hi.

456
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,147
Look at that.

457
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,569
You said almost the same thing back then

458
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,242
and you apologized later,
saying you made a mistake.

459
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,341
Welcome.

460
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,917
I'll drive fast,
as this is a call from our mother.

461
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,477
They smell so good,
even by putting them in the house.

462
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,849
Aren't you going to make
any yellow plum wine?

463
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,436
Why would I turn these
good things into wine?

464
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,732
Mom.

465
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,105
I need to meet my biological father.

466
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,874
My tummy.

467
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,162
-I'm going to the restroomâ¦
-Stay here.

468
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,286
Don't do that anymore.

469
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,077
Why?

470
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,802
It says "Jirisan Yellow Plums."
on the box.

471
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,473
These grew from yellow plum trees
in Jirisan Mountain.

472
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,850
I shouldn't leave it like
unfinished homework

473
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,641
and find him.

474
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,225
How can I find him?

475
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,310
That's straightforward.

476
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,226
I know where he is.

477
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,824
A straightforward answer.

478
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,189
He was on the TV.

479
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,487
Is he famous?

480
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,082
If you want to go see him, I'll tell you.

481
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,155
Okay.

482
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,868
Andâ¦

483
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,713
I'm leaving.

484
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,250
-To where?
-When?

485
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,007
I don't know.

486
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,894
That's what you say the most
whenever I ask you something.

487
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,682
But,

488
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,601
I really don't know.

489
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,518
Why did we think

490
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,737
that Mom's anger would melt away
if we act cute a few times?

491
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,029
Isn't it funny?

492
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,913
Look how it hops
because it grew up with rabbits.

493
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,703
This cat runs like a horse. Cool, right?

494
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,457
When I'm with Eun-joo,

495
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,549
I try to be rational like her.

496
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,509
And when I'm with Eun-hee,

497
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,839
I try to be cute and bubbly.

498
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,836
And it felt like I lost my true self.

499
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,268
I was worried if I'm going to
live as the youngest forever.

500
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,391
So that's why I did that.

501
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,149
I'm really sorry, Mom.

502
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,817
Itâs harder if you clean
the house all at once.

503
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,322
It's better to clean
little by little every day.

504
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,244
Why did we think

505
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,246
that Mom's wound can be cured

506
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,674
with a three-night trip?

507
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,259
I JUST ARRIVED
I'LL SEND YOU PHOTOS SO TAKE A LOOK

508
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,442
I can't stand being curious.

509
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,114
I hardly apologize to anyone.

510
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,611
Did I apologize to you
when we were trainees?

511
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,153
Right.

512
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,907
You've been thinking that until now?

513
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,819
Jeez.

514
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,987
It makes me sad that you can't remember.

515
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,043
I guess you really don't remember.

516
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,088
Okay, I'll tell you.

517
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,674
When we were trainees,
I was openly nice to you

518
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,337
and always followed you around.

519
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,796
You told me that you didn't
want to date anyone

520
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,678
and said I was making you uncomfortable.

521
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,515
I was dating back then.

522
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,562
You made the same face back then too.

523
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,395
And then you suddenly turned serious

524
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,900
and said, "I'm sorry
if you misunderstood."

525
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,406
And of course, I said it's okay.

526
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,569
Do you remember?

527
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,491
I don't really remember.

528
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,496
But I think I said it.

529
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,998
Butâ¦

530
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,377
I broke up with her.

531
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:43,459
I was too busy to spend time with her,
and it created misunderstandings.

532
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,801
She was a good person.

533
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,135
She said she wanted to spend
a lot of time with me,

534
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,102
but I couldn't do that.

535
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,595
I was incapable at the time,
so when I was assigned with work,

536
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,606
I was busy meeting the deadline,

537
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,029
so I really envied your capability.

538
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,400
One keeps being sorry,

539
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,453
and the other keeps trying to understand.

540
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,036
That's a sad thing.

541
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:19,421
When I wasn't sure
whether my feelings were love or guilt,

542
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,880
she broke up with me.

543
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,717
Soâ¦

544
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,926
I totally understand
what you're trying to say.

545
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,939
Doing nothing.

546
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,231
Doing nothing until you're at peace.

547
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,028
I'll try my best to do nothing.

548
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:02,587
I know how disgusting
it feels more than anyone.

549
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,628
Even when I said it's fishy

550
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,376
and asked you
why you're sending her money,

551
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,125
you believed her, right?

552
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,719
I did.

553
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,308
She wasnât a total stranger.

554
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,348
She was your first love.

555
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,267
But now, I'm angry at myself
for being conned

556
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,482
by something that dumb.

557
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,942
And you regret losing money too, huh?

558
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,863
I did at first,

559
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,493
but nowâ¦

560
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:33,659
I feel like I hurt my family so badly,
so I'm not really regretting losing money.

561
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,741
I feel like I lost my place
as the youngest, who is loved by everyone,

562
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,247
with my own hands.

563
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,749
You know it.

564
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,962
Let's have macarons
as the two troublemaking young ones.

565
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,336
By the wayâ¦

566
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,844
Why is Chan-hyuk going out
so much these days?

567
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,717
Don't you smell something from the CEO?

568
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,555
I smell romance from him.

569
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,063
Really? So his blind date was a success?

570
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,902
You're not keen and you're brainless.

571
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,855
Pathetic.

572
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,948
You knowâ¦

573
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,785
I really hate it when someone says that.

574
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,995
What did you shoot?

575
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,838
I'm testing my new camera.

576
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,677
-You bought another camera?
-"Another?"

577
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,518
Why do your words feel
slightly aggressive?

578
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,890
I don't say, "You bought another book?"

579
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,725
You think buying books is a waste?

580
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,864
Its price is incomparable to cameras.

581
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,533
You think buying cameras is a waste?

582
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,410
Why would you compare it to book prices?
This is my job.

583
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,950
Is this how we're going back to reality?

584
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,750
You're not letting our Ji-woo

585
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,539
notice our relationship, right?

586
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,212
You mind your own business.

587
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,001
Gosh.

588
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,378
My sister's divorced life,

589
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,882
Ji-woo's learning about life,

590
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,974
and my parent's declaration of moving out.

591
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,602
So I can't announce my relationship now.

592
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,218
I don't like secret dating.

593
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,055
Why? Do you wish to tell everyone
that you're dating Park Chan-hyuk?

594
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,476
As soon as I switched to dating mode,
I learned something new about you.

595
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,395
What is it?

596
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,573
Our sense of humor matched
when we were friends.

597
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,902
But you really need toâ¦

598
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,449
cut back on the dad jokes these days.

599
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,083
Do Iâ¦

600
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,078
make a lot of dad jokes?

601
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,710
But I'm not a dad.

602
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,080
Dads have a lot of money.

603
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,337
If I had a lot of money,

604
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,339
I'd buy cameras.

605
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,301
Stop it!

606
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,591
You stop it.

607
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,019
MOM: DADA ART GALLERY

608
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,400
DADA ART GALLERY

609
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,350
Hi.

610
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,607
I'm Kim Eun-joo, the one who called you.

611
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,650
Have a seat.

612
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,656
Firstâ¦

613
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,496
can I tell you about my situation?

614
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,042
Yes.

615
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,419
I got married when I was almost 50.

616
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,665
My eldest daughter is
a high school senior now.

617
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,337
I believe a family must be

618
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,258
as sturdy as a fortress

619
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,516
until the children reach adulthood.

620
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,018
I'm saying this situation

621
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:33,311
can make my family suffer.

622
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,399
My mother told me
she didn't hide her pregnancy.

623
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,117
Haven't you ever thought
that this day might come?

624
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,036
I haven't.

625
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:52,541
I think the significance of relationships
is in time.

626
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,844
Even parents and children
are nothing but a hollow shells

627
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,709
if they don't spend time together.

628
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,088
I learned that

629
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,471
my biological father
is someone else recently.

630
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,595
I don't like having
any unfinished business,

631
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,603
so I had to meet you at least once.

632
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,726
That's all.

633
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,572
Ms. Kim Eun-ji, you and I
do have a similarity.

634
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,247
This is the wisest thing I can do

635
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,799
without letting my family know.

636
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,142
It's Kim Eun-joo.

637
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,056
Please remember my name
correctly at least.

638
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:59,191
I've never been interested in paintings,
so I'd like to refuse this.

639
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,954
Please be happy
and live a long, healthy life.

640
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,600
At that time, my mom
was the 60-year-old Lee Jin-sook

641
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,227
who chose a life for herself

642
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,857
instead of that of a mother.

643
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,533
Like how she did when she was 22.

644
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,409
Iâ¦

645
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,528
want to leave.

646
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,464
Yes.

647
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,172
You should.

648
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,747
I read thatâ¦

649
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,165
Buckâ¦

650
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,335
The bucket list you wrote.

651
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,887
Those are things you want to do
before you die.

652
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,385
BE A GRANDMA
WALK ON DULLE TRAIL

653
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,260
Do everything you want to do.

654
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,563
I alsoâ¦

655
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,561
read your bucket list.

656
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,147
READ MS. SOOK'S POEM

657
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,073
BUY A HOUSE WITH A YARD

658
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,031
TAKE A FAMILY PHOTO

659
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,240
PUT 100 MILLION WON IN MY BANK ACCOUNT

660
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,360
LEARN TO PLAY THE HARMONICA

661
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,696
GO TO A FLOWER FESTIVAL WITH MS. SOOK

662
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,159
Do you think the kids know?

663
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,040
That we have so many things
we want to do at our age.

664
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,083
People live up to 100 years now,

665
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,495
but we're worried about
how to make a living

666
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,007
until we get old
and think about the future.

667
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,511
They must be struggling
on their own day by day,

668
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,138
so how would they know?

669
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,891
It is hard.

670
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,645
Life is hard.

671
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,864
I'm going to leave.

672
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,164
Butâ¦

673
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,907
I don't know

674
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,946
where I want to go just yet.

675
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,521
Mom left.

676
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,811
We didnât really talk about

677
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,355
Mom's absence.

678
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,504
It was amazing not to know anything about

679
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,665
what my mom is doing
for the first time in my life.

680
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,169
It's because you eat anything.

681
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,677
I didn't just eat whatever. I ate bread.

682
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,010
Ji-woo.

683
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,474
-It's so good.
-What's wrong with you?

684
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:00,966
We missed her,

685
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,352
but the guilt we felt whenever we saw Mom

686
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,767
was slightly lifted.

687
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,566
The feeling of indebtedness

688
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,374
that our daily lives
were the result of sacrificing Mom's time

689
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,870
was also slightly lifted.

690
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,642
We all

691
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,598
spent individual time for ourselves

692
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,400
and kept on finding our true self.

693
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,823
Are you eating well?

694
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,743
Of course. I'm not a kid.

695
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,072
Stop being a cheapskate
and turn on the furnace.

696
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,197
Thanks for worrying about me.

697
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,075
That littleâ¦

698
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,697
Hi, Eun-joo.

699
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,368
It's quite cold.

700
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,366
Yes.

701
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,917
-It's fermented already.
-Yes.

702
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,960
-Take your portion later.
-Okay.

703
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,554
Take a lot of it.

704
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,549
How have you been?

705
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,220
-We're fine, Dad.
-Okay.

706
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,588
Ji-woo.

707
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,716
This is for you, Dad.
Mix it with warm water and drink it.

708
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,181
It's good for coughing.

709
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,975
THE SCENE ROUTE
SLEEPLESS NIGHT

710
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,362
Thank you.

711
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,149
I bought this book.

712
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,157
I didn't even sell 100 copies yet,

713
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,579
but I met one of my 100 readers.
Thank you.

714
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,500
I gave it to the employees as a gift too.

715
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,667
You point that out.
Makes me feel intimidated.

716
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,498
There's no monthly salary,
so I get a share,

717
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,086
so you made a great contribution.

718
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,301
But,

719
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,721
itâs clearly a loss

720
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,465
and the fact is I have to quit.

721
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,102
My first project failed too.

722
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,258
Find a topic among the things

723
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,887
you know the best
and think about the most.

724
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,101
Like what?

725
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,652
Are all of your family matters resolved?

726
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,355
There's no end to that, isn't there?

727
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,402
Well.

728
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,200
When I was in the US,
I thought of my family a lot,

729
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,950
but when I'm here, I call them even less.

730
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,367
I think more of my aunt,
who made me feel uncomfortable.

731
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,367
Are you giving me an item?

732
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,290
The item about familyâ¦

733
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,254
Isn't that a bit cliche?

734
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,008
I think it would be fun
if a group of writers

735
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,551
write about their experiences.

736
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,385
We Are Family.

737
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,016
Since "we" and "family" are together,

738
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,774
happiness in the family seems forced.

739
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,691
I think you are getting
some ideas already.

740
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,401
Will I be mentioned in the book?

741
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,070
Are you doing fine?

742
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,321
Yes. I'm doing really fine.

743
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,565
"I'm doing really fine."
I like the sound of that.

744
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,696
{\an8}INDEPENDENT PUBLICATION 2021

745
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,871
My eyeliner is so mismatched today.

746
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,287
You're still pretty, my daughter Ji-soo.

747
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,456
I hate it!

748
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,173
You look pretty.

749
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,394
Mom, are you doing

750
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,008
really fine right now?

751
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,676
You should've called first.

752
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,354
Then I might've not been able
to see a doctor riding a bicycle,

753
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:16,154
which is something I have never
imagined with you.

754
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,984
Wait for a bit. I'll go get changed.

755
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,066
It's wine.

756
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,070
Thank you.

757
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,827
GOHEUNG HEALTH CENTER

758
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,125
Has it been more than a year?

759
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,505
Yes.

760
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,557
I thought of calling you
a few times, but I couldn't.

761
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,437
I guess I hold grudges
longer than I thought.

762
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,649
You didn't know?

763
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,477
You hold grudges.

764
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,404
Me?

765
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,242
I don't.

766
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,611
You don't know me well.

767
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,201
I know you so well.

768
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:14,413
I knew you'd suddenly come and see me
without calling me this whole time.

769
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,870
And you did.

770
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,806
You paint?

771
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,218
You?

772
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,887
It's just a hobby.

773
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,185
But I think I'm talented.

774
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,774
Show it to me later.

775
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,148
Would that day come?

776
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,318
Are you seeing anyone?

777
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,826
I have a friend.

778
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,788
I like that he doesn't ask
unnecessary questions.

779
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,957
I guess he doesn't talk much like me.

780
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,673
No.

781
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,461
He doesn't ask unnecessary questions,

782
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,094
but he talks too much.

783
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,172
You guys are alike.

784
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,008
You talk quite a lot too.

785
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,720
Me?

786
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,135
I donât.

787
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:19,063
You seriously know me
in the wrong ways about so many things.

788
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,114
When you scold Eun-hee,
and when you point out someone's weakness,

789
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,978
you talk a lot.

790
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,820
-And you talk fast too.
-I talk only when I need to.

791
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,782
I can see their weaknesses,
and it'd be great if they can fix them.

792
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,195
I don't know how others hold back.

793
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,544
I actually take my time to tell it slowly.

794
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,459
It's not easy to do that.

795
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,634
Are Mother and Father well?

796
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,468
Yes.

797
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,179
I contact Eun-hee sometimes.

798
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,723
I know.

799
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,350
I'm sure it'll stop eventually.

800
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,403
I think Eun-hee might
keep on contacting me.

801
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,774
She asked me to let her
live in a room when I build a house.

802
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,743
When will I come to understand her?

803
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,534
Ji-woo doesnât contact me.

804
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,042
He doesn't think badly about you,

805
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,461
but I'm sure he doesnât
want to contact you either.

806
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,000
We're family but different.

807
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,841
I've been speaking to you
like when we were married.

808
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,263
And addressed my family
like when we were married too.

809
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,350
That's hard to fix.

810
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,892
Eun-hee told me.

811
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,397
That it's a trace
that we were family once.

812
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,316
I want you to be happy.

813
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,949
Because we were family.

814
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,905
I want you to be happy too.

815
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,373
Like I am right now.

816
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,595
Have a safe trip back.

817
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,759
Bye.

818
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,423
MOM

819
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,875
Yes, Mom.

820
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,877
Me? I'm with Eun-hee.

821
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,224
Okay, good night.

822
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,432
Why are you so shocked?

823
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,676
I hung up.

824
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,979
Hey, did you tell your mother about me?

825
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:09,983
Of course, I did.

826
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,274
I canât keep on hiding it.

827
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,357
Want me to go on blind dates again?

828
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,487
Are you done? Did you finish it?

829
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,827
What did she say?

830
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,501
"Okay, good luck."

831
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,342
"Eun-hee? I remember her."
"Be happy with her." The end.

832
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,995
What? How can your mother remember me?

833
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,337
She remembers you
as a loud girl, like now.

834
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,757
Wow, my mom has a good memory.

835
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,546
Didn't you talk to Mom

836
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,806
on the phone while you were drunk
when we were in university?

837
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:43,719
Wow.

838
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,814
Don't tell my family.

839
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,569
Hey, be nice to your mother.

840
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,940
Be nice to your mother.

841
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,236
I'll be nice too.

842
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,707
I think I missed the call.

843
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,094
Hey, your clothesâ¦

844
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,929
Eun-hee.

845
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,010
-Eun-hee.
-Hi.

846
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,306
Did you eat ramen?

847
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,219
Yes.

848
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:32,975
Chan-hyukâ¦

849
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,116
Dating someoneâ¦

850
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,538
My brother-in-law?

851
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,415
is accepting another family

852
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,255
with your entire body.

853
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,022
According to my reasoningâ¦

854
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,403
Dad knows where Mom is.

855
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,690
Andâ¦

856
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,412
I think Mom

857
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,488
will come back soon.

858
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,415
Where's your evidence?

859
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,749
Dad's been coming home
every day these past few days.

860
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,245
Did he bring his things home?

861
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,674
Things?

862
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,550
I don't know about thatâ¦

863
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,507
Well, anyway,
he cleans the house so diligently.

864
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,768
He put flowers in the vase too.

865
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,520
I put those flowers in.

866
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,192
I was such an idiot to believe you.

867
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,782
No, it's true this time.

868
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,716
How was your walk today?

869
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,354
It was good.

870
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,971
But it was a bit tiring.

871
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,480
How's the weather?

872
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,401
it's good.

873
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,230
Want to see it?

874
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,700
Wow.

875
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,994
The sky is so beautiful.

876
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,080
Isn't it great?

877
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,581
The test is coming soon.

878
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,753
Okay.

879
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,459
Well done.

880
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,672
It's late here today,

881
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,553
so I brought the guitar,
but I can't sing for you.

882
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,801
It's okay.

883
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,728
Dad sang to her, playing the guitar.

884
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:28,362
The trail where lovers walk on

885
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,621
Hand in hand

886
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:41,498
Our paradise is far ahead

887
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,421
Calls for us

888
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,301
Waving at us

889
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,138
Hi.

890
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,517
Aren't you tired?

891
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,771
I'm good.

892
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,577
Mom.

893
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,962
I missed you to death.

894
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,210
My daughter.

895
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,804
Let me see your face.

896
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,589
You lovely girl.

897
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,553
-I'm lovely?
-Yes.

898
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:16,808
Hi.

899
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,563
Hi, how have you been?

900
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,732
Good.

901
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,729
You look well.

902
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,897
I'm well.

903
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,862
Mom!

904
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,069
Mom!

905
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:33,783
Ji-woo.

906
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,779
Ji-woo.

907
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,498
No one asked about the time Mom had.

908
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,963
Ji-woo, put this on.

909
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,331
-Goodness.
-Right now?

910
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,458
Yes. And this is for Eun-joo.

911
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,546
Goodness!

912
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,430
And this is for Eun-hee.

913
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,216
And this is for Young-sik.

914
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,313
It's hard for him to put on
and take off shoes since he has a bad leg.

915
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,850
These have no shoelaces,
so they're convenient.

916
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,484
We can keep buying him these shoes.

917
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,361
And these are shirts for children.

918
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,069
I bought them in a bigger size.

919
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,399
-Are they for Yong-gyoo?
-Yes.

920
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:13,864
Eun-hee, give this to Ji-woo's boss.

921
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,369
Why are you telling me toâ¦

922
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,790
-Isn't the color of the water pretty?
-Yes.

923
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,751
What is this?

924
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,212
Isn't it wonderful?

925
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,705
Yes, it is.

926
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,717
Looks like Mom went to the U.S.

927
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,089
I saw Jeju chocolate too.

928
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,546
I saw jeotgal from Sokcho.

929
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,760
What are you all doing? Come here.

930
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,347
Mom, did you take photos?

931
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,522
Yes.

932
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,555
Were you looking at the photos?

933
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:49,147
We put on our perfectly-fit clothes

934
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,529
and felt that we were with Mom
at all times during her time,

935
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,818
and we saw Mom's big smile
for the first time,

936
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,243
and that was good enough.

937
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,242
Wow!

938
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,889
Why did you ask me

939
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,185
to have a fling with you when I have time?

940
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,687
That was just
for a social media upload, right?

941
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,903
They only see
what they want to see, anyway.

942
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,530
It won't do any damage.

943
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,574
And your girl might be watching too.

944
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,162
I'm totally fine now.

945
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,126
The only one who knows me completely

946
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,205
is myself.

947
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,234
Seriouslyâ¦

948
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,150
Please teach me how to
deal with a ridiculous client.

949
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,726
How is the client being ridiculous?

950
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,690
Does he or she psychologically harass you?

951
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,817
Or does he or she call you
all the time and waste your time?

952
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,405
Or maybe not giving you materials
when you need them?

953
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,451
Do all those

954
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,740
have different solutions?

955
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,708
I must know what's making you suffer
the most to solve it first.

956
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,669
If I don't know much, I can't solve it.

957
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,044
What's making me suffer the mostâ¦

958
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,418
Every dayâ¦

959
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,594
Dreaming about the future

960
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,433
and being anxious about the future

961
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,007
is also my responsibility.

962
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,443
We're going to
a salted mackerel factory this time.

963
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,650
The script you wrote is surely different.

964
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,532
I can clearly see what I have to shoot.

965
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,242
You're making me work for you

966
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,912
because I can't make money, right?

967
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,288
Is this a family business?

968
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,288
I pay you for scriptwriting.

969
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,622
Huh?

970
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,834
Are we family?

971
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,999
Yes, CEO.

972
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,844
But I have a dream too.

973
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,602
Chan-hyuk.

974
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:29,845
Yes?

975
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,521
You know the most about me.

976
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,938
You know the most about me too.

977
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,782
That tickles. Stop it.

978
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,406
Donât do it. Seriously.

979
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,820
Youâ¦

980
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,578
