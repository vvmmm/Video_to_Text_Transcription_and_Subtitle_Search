2
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:03,813
I was talking
to my positive affirmation app.

3
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,253
<i>You got this, Sadie.</i>

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,722
It would be so cool
if you were here.

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,491
I wish you were real.
[cell phone buzzing]

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,127
Ah!

7
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,828
<i>You can freeze time?</i>

8
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,264
Mom, Dad, I was wondering
if we could be

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,399
Lay Lay's host family.

10
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,534
It would be like
a wish come true.

11
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,169
I hear everything.

12
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,004
No one knows you're
the avatar I wished to life.

13
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,299
Yeah!

14
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:24,463
What?

15
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,399
I can explain.

16
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,831
Explain that.

17
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,089
Okay, Marky.
We need to talk.

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,685
[âª âª]

19
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:41,040
Now, this is how you
make a bed the right way.

20
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,677
And this it's how you make

21
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:49,336
a bed the Lay Lay way.

22
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,695
What's wrong with you?

23
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,882
What's wrong with you?

24
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,956
Anyway, have you seen
Marky yet?

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,758
Not since he found out
you're an avatar

26
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:00,126
that came out of my phone.

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,828
Girl, I've never seen
someone scream so loud

28
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,096
and run so fast.

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,366
And I've seen your father
around a cricket.

30
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,902
And that's after we
explained everything to Marky.

31
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,138
Yeah.
Now that he knows my secret,

32
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:14,106
we got to make sure he's cool.

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,641
Otherwise, he's gonna tell
your parents.

34
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:17,443
And they'll know
we've been lying to them.

35
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,139
There's nothing my parents hate
more than liars.

36
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,366
Maybe raisins and coleslaw,
but liars are up there.

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,818
Hopefully, he's
not freaking out.

38
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,308
I'm still freaking out.

39
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:32,758
I can't believe I've been
around Lay Lay this long

40
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,261
and never noticed
anything strange about her.

41
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,897
Or did I notice,
and you made me forget?

42
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,165
Do you have mind-wipe powers?

43
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,045
Stop wiping my mind.

44
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,002
She didn't.
You just didn't notice

45
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,600
anything strange about her.

46
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,163
Because there's nothing
strange to notice.

47
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,242
Besides, you're a 10-year-old
who wears a sweater vest.

48
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,389
I wouldn't talk, little one.

49
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,320
Marky, this is a good thing.

50
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,550
When Lay Lay was
in my phone,

51
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:58,684
she was an avatar

52
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,885
for my positive affirmation
app.

53
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,273
Yes.
I'm really good

54
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,454
at helping people become

55
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:03,923
the best versions
of themselves.

56
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,157
Look at me.

57
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,392
Because of Lay Lay,
I'm more outgoing,

58
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,561
and I'm the president
of my class now.

59
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,598
She even gave me the confidence
to become an era-era DJ.

60
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:15,401
Some people say
I got it going in...

61
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,402
On?

62
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,570
Out?

63
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,439
Whatever.
People are talking.

64
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,274
I'm talking about how,
just 12 hours ago,

65
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,009
I saw you turn invisible.

66
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,945
Okay.
Did it scare you?

67
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,013
Please.
I'm done freaking out.

68
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:30,771
Okay.
[gasps]

69
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:33,986
- Boo!
- Ah!

70
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,855
I was wrong.

71
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,290
I'm still freaking out!

This is either
their happy dance,

76
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,327
or they stepped
in some fire ants.

77
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,609
Girls, we just got some

78
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,594
of the best news
of our careers.

79
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,898
Oh, let me guess, Bun B
sampled one of your songs,

80
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,467
and now you're rich, so we can
spend the rest of our lives

81
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,405
on private jets and yachts.

82
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,143
No, but thank you for making
our good news less exciting.

83
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,812
We were named Advertising
Songwriters of the Year

84
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,415
by the Cleveland Hall of Fame
Music Awards.

Both: Whoa!

86
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,451
You won a CHoFMA?

87
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,954
That's how John Legend
became John Legend.

88
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,990
Before he won a CHoFMA,
he was just John.

89
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,625
There's a fancy ceremony
coming up,

90
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,027
and anybody who's anybody
in the biz attends.

91
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,797
Winning an award like this
triples your business.

92
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,900
So maybe there
will be a yacht.

93
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,070
There ain't gonna be
no yachts.

94
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:43,807
Look, can't you just
be happy for us?

95
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,843
Bryce, tell them who we're
asking to introduce us.

96

Iggy Azalea.

00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,484
Really?
You stole my thunder?

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,821
Mr. A, you know Iggy Azalea?

101
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,158
Oh, you're not as lame
as Sadie says you are.

102
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,593
I never said lame.

103
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,319
I said... I love you, daddy.

104
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,799
Iggy is the perfect person
to do it.

105
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,002
Yeah, we co-wrote a jingle
with her before she blew up.

106
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,737
We're practically peers.

107
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,238
Yeah, just like
Mrs. A's workout buddy

108
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,339
is Michelle Obama.

109
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,942
Right.

110
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:23,980
Michelle wishes she had
this arm definition.

111
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,882
And every year, the CHoFMA
recipient gets to pick someone

112
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,219
to perform at the ceremony.

113
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,189
Oh, here's a crazy idea
that isn't so crazy.

114
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,724
What if Lay Lay and I perform?

115
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,827
Oh, girls, I'm sorry.

116
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,596
I think what the music awards
are looking for

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,765
is more of a big-name act.

118
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,602
What's bigger than someone
with two names?

119
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,370
Come on, Mom and Dad,
we want to perform

Please, Mrs. A.
I won't beg you,

but I will make Sadie do it.

124
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,986
Okay, but you girls got
to bring your A game.

that means you two

And you know that means?

- But you're so young.

318
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:14,021
Am I, or are you
just really old?

319
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,656
Listen, little girl...

320
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,291
Uh, thank you.

321
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,061
Thank you for taking the time
to meet with us.

322
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,830
So Iggy would love to give
your presentation speech.

323
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,699
Yes!

324
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,534
I celebrated too soon,
didn't I?

325
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,970
Little bit.

326
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,339
As her new assistant,
I need to make sure

327
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,775
that she's associating
with the right people.

328
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:35,543
Mrs. Alexander,
it's to my understanding

329
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,378
that you're a bit of a...

330
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:40,281
diva.

331
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,949
Excuse me?

332
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,452
Oh, no, you said the D word.

333
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,287
Iggy said you got
into an argument with her

334
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,222
the last time
you worked together.

335
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:50,158
Oh, no, she's still
hung up on that?

336
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:51,826
I wouldn't call it
an argument.

337
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,863
It's just she was wrong,
and I was right.

338
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:59,300
And apparently,
you told her that, a lot.

339
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:01,102
It was a jingle
for Hooper's Hot Tubs,

340
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,904
but it was so long ago,
who can even remember...

341
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,305
Okay.

342
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,575
She wanted
âª Ooh, my, my, buy a hot tub âª

343
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,177
But I knew it should be

344
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:13,447
âª My, my, ooh,
buy a hot tub âª

345
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,448
You heard it.

346
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,105
I was right.

347
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:17,985
Should I be talking to you?

348
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,788
I think that would be best.

349
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,090
The only way Iggy is willing
to introduce you two

350
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,793
is if I get a video
of her apologizing.

351
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,328
Okay.

352
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,429
I understand.

353
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:29,530
Come on, baby.

354
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:30,731
Say you're sorry.

355
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,099
Oh, that's not it.

356
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:33,835
Iggy wants Trish to do
an "I'm sorry" dance

357
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,370
so she can share it
with her millions of followers.

358
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,172
Oh, and you're gonna love
this song.

359
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:42,665
It goes
âª Ooh, my, my, I'm sorry âª

360
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:45,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

361
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,582
I'm sorry that you wasted
your breath

362
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,684
singing that nonsense.

363
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:53,521
Honey, honey, having
Iggy Azalea introduce us

364
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:54,722
would be a huge deal.

365
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,692
Just... just apologize.

366
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,660
Who cares now?

367
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:02,163
No.

368

No, baby, baby, no.

You have 24 hours
to change your mind.

I'll be here same time
tomorrow.

Oh, right.

373
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,980
I ordered lunch,
but now I'm not hungry.

to pay for it.

Now you're running?

Lay Lay fired me up.

We have to figure out

Fake it till you make it.

Tonight, we own the world.

801

Or at least
downtown Cleveland.

Come over here for a sec.

805
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,583
Look at this place.

806
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,352

807
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,888

811
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,232
Hi, Jasmine.

812
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,300
Where's Iggy?

813
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,735
Funny story.

814
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,004
Not in a ha-ha way,
more like a,

815
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,528
"Ooh, that's completely ruined
your night" kind of way.

816
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,043
Jasmine, you don't want
to play with me right now.

817
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,579
Cut to the chase.

818
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,047
All right.

819
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,050
Iggy was dropping a puck
at a big hockey game in Calgary

820
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,885
and got snowed in.

821
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,020
She can't make it to the show.

822
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,721
All: What?

823
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:52,481
She's really sorry,
like super-duper sorry.

824
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,562
What are we supposed to do?

825
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,963
This is our parents' big night.

826
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,865
Lay Lay!

827
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,033
That's right, Lay Lay.

828
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,736
You're going to get
to perform, too.

829
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,172
If it's any consolation,
Iggy said

830
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,440
I should introduce you guys.

831
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,275
How is that consolation?

832
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,511
We told everyone that she
was gonna introduce us.

833
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,214
We're gonna look like fools.

834
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:17,318
Guys, this is not
the end of the world.

835
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:21,589
Trish, you and I are
still getting a CHoFMA,

836
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,991
and I know you're gonna rock
that speech.

837
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,460
- Am I?
- Yeah.

838
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,729
Of course, I am,
because I've been waiting

839
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,031
for this moment
my entire career,

840
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,502
and my mama didn't raise
no coward.

841
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:35,836
Sadie and Lay Lay,

842
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,172
I know you're gonna electrify
this crowd.

843
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,440
- Lay Lay!
- Hey!

844
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,541
That's the spirit!

845
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,877
They're gonna chant
your name.

846
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,878
That's right.

847
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,813
Lay Lay and I are ready.

848
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,182
I hope.

849
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,553
Guys, we're Alexanders.

850
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,488
I know this isn't exactly
how we planned it,

851
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,192
but it's still gonna be
a magical night.

852
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,460
You're right, Dad.

853
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,195
This is going to be
a magical night.

854
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,130
Don't mess it up.

855
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,233
I wasn't done yet.

856
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,502
It's gonna be a magical night

857
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,273
because I get
to be on stage with my family.

858
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,463
There's nothing
better than that.

859
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,977
We got this.

860
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,281
Alexanders on three.

Lay Lay, I wish you could
say something other than...

868
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,065
- Lay Lay.
- Yup.

869
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,922
That's the one.

870
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,140
Sweet James Brown,
we've struck the mother lode.

It's all the swag bags.

872
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,677
Lay Lay, I'm gonna need you
to use

873
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,512
your super speed powers
to get these samples

874

[hands sparking]

879
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,970
Why are Lay Lay's hands
shooting fireworks?

880

That's just the magic
of the scheme coming together.

881
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,408
Lay Lay, you're amazing.

00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,169
You're amazing.

885
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,517
Lay Lay, you said
something other than "Lay Lay."

886
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,187
You got this.

887
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,655
Oh, no.

888
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,023
Those were Lay Lay's
default phrases

889
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,558
when she was in my phone.

890
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,726
When we reset her,
she must have went back

to factory mode.

892

Lay Lay, it's me, Sadie.

Hi. I'm Lay Lay.

- What?

No.

896

You know me.

897
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,968
Nice to meet you, Nome.

898

I'm Lay Lay.

899
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,739
Oh, no.
Marky, this is not good.

900
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,007
She doesn't know who I am.

901
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,142
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to break her.

902

Whatever you say, superstar.

903
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,413
She's gone.

My best friend is gone.

905

When life gets you down,
turn that frown upside down.

906

for an app that talks
like this?

908

Marky, you don't understand.

909
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,659
Lay Lay helped me
with my confidence.

910
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,627
She helped me come out
of my shell.

911
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,629
She's like the sister
I never had.

You didn't even get
the ad-free version?

It wouldn't have been

Marky, we need to figure out

958
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,098
what we're gonna do
with Lay Lay.

959
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,332
She's still broken.

960
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,034
Boom.
That's what I'm talking about.

Oh, man.

Lay Lay and I are supposed
to perform next, but if we do,

964
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,843
someone will figure out Lay Lay
is an avatar from my phone,

965
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:19,278
and then the men in black
will show up,

966
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,679
and they'll do that thing
where they just stare at you

967
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,114
until you start talking.

968
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,716
And if you don't talk, they'll
offer you a stick of gum

969
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,050
and stare at you
until you do talk.

970
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,752
And then, they'll take away
my best friend,

971
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:28,153
and all I'll have left
is a stick of gum.

972
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,888
And it'll be winter mint,
which everyone knows

973
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:32,791
is the worst flavor of gum,
because it burns your tongue.

974
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,694
I'm going to be friendless
with a burning tongue.

[cheers and applause]

Thank my mama

Mama, I took pride in my work,

I have to thank
one more person.

Okay, then.

Oh, and my first grade teacher,
Mrs. Weldon.

995
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,148
I got her through
the stage fright.

I'm that good.

997

Yeah.

998
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,851
Is she ever gonna stop?

No.

1000
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:36,822
She's on one.

1001

And to Nelly Sal win,
that girl in seventh grade,

you'll always wonder why.

Ah, ever since
those stupid hiccups,

1011

she just hasn't been Lay Lay.

That's it.

1013
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:07,219
Maybe if we cure the hiccups,

1014
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,654
it will cure the glitch.

1015

Okay, but how?

1016
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,456
When someone has
the hiccups,

1017
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,025
you have to scare them,
like this.

Go big or go home.

That's not
how you scare Lay Lay.

1021
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:22,100
This is how you scare Lay Lay.

1022
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:25,170
Girl, your shoes
don't match your jacket.

1023

[hiccups] The best way

Oh, no.

1025

If hearing her outfit is wack

1026
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:32,110
didn't scare her out of it,

1027
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,045
nothing will.

1028
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,302
No, there is another way.

Ah!

Ah!

1034
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,497
What happened
to your eyebrows?

1035
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:56,223
Marky, your forehead so big,
now it's a five-head.

1036

That was snark.

I missed you so much.

1040
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:05,677
I missed you, too.

1041
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:07,012
I felt so weird.

1042
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:09,715
It's like I was me,
but I wasn't me.

1043
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:12,551
Lay Lay, I'm sorry
I overused your powers.

1044
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:13,919
I won't do it again.

1045

I love having you around.

From now on,
your secret is safe with me.

That means a lot.

Right?
