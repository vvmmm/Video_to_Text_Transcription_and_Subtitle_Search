FAMILY MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS FAMILY WITH LOVE

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:41,002
{\an8}Although I didn't want it,
thank you for today.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,375
{\an8}It seems like you're okay now,
but when you're home aloneâ¦

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,877
{\an8}The emotions will come back.

6
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,845
{\an8}You should stay at
Eun-hee's house for a while.

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,563
{\an8}I don't know where she lives.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,476
{\an8}I can take care of myself. Go home now.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,819
Do you have something to say?

10
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,333
I remember the day
I saw you for the first time.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,325
Me?

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,865
When was it?

13
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,576
Your father was at the hospital
due to an accident.

14
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,167
I went to Eun-hee's house
often with Jong-min,

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,463
because Ji-woo was too young
to stay alone.

16
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,593
Right.

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,894
I was working
as a substitute teacher at the time.

18
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,854
You saw me at my house, right?

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,055
No, Iâ¦

20
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,438
I first saw you at the park
in front of your house.

21
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,534
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
Loser buys ramyeon.

22
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,901
-Rock, paper--
-Wait.

23
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,574
Gosh.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,947
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

25
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,254
Yes!

26
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,578
It's always like this.

27
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,334
You two planned it, right?

28
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,325
Are you two dating?

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,996
Are you nuts?
What kind of nonsense is that?

30
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,297
Go.

31
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,471
It's like this all the time.

32
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,809
Someone was crying alone
in a corner of the park.

33
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,361
She looked even lonelier
because it was nightfall.

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,485
She was there until I came back

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,869
from buying ramyeon.

36
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,949
And thatâ¦

37
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,623
was you.

38
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,302
You're back. You haven't eaten yet, right?

39
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,668
-Hi.
-Hi.

40
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,134
Someone who was crying
alone in the park came in

41
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,721
with ice cream in her hand
as if nothing happened.

42
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,595
I don't remember.

43
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,480
I wasn't doing well at that time.

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,404
And don't most people cry alone?

45
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,685
If Eun-hee wants to cry,

46
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,986
she calls everyone to let them know.

47
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,906
I seriously don't understand her.

48
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,623
Then you should try it too.
Instead of crying alone.

49
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,623
If you need someone, call me.

50
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,463
I don't think I'll ever do that.

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Then

52
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,773
when you're aloneâ¦

53
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,943
take a look at the wedding photos I took.

54
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,901
Photographers

55
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,989
get to see and hear
a lot of things at weddings.

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,040
In this situationâ¦

57
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,836
What you said makes me flustered.

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,341
If there are any feelings
you've covered up,

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,144
then I think it'd be good
to take it out for once.

60
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,944
Yes, I might try when I have time.
You can go now.

61
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,739
Did youâ¦

62
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,580
Did you tell Eun-joo directly?

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,117
No.

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,750
Was she your Goheung trip partner?

65
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,633
Let's go and eat. I'm hungry. Bye.

66
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,632
Okay.

67
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,512
Did you go to Goheung with Chan-hyuk?

68
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,677
What about Eun-hee?

69
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,557
Eun-joo, what is it?

70
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,360
Why did you go there with Chan-hyuk?

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,488
-You know where Eun-hee lives, right?
-Yes.

72
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,189
Ms. Sook, give it to me.

73
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,487
Ms. Sook, I'll do it.

74
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,704
What were you doing out?

75
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,745
I was thinking about whether
to buy Korean melons or tangerines.

76
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,795
I only worked one shift today,
from Incheon to Incheon.

77
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,434
I'm going to take the orders
that others avoid taking

78
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,139
from now on.

79
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,469
So I think I won't be able to
come home that often now, andâ¦

80
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,101
I heard graduation from marriage
is living separately--

81
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,564
Did you find the letter I wrote to you?

82
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,283
You seeâ¦

83
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,826
I'm looking for it.

84
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,789
How do you find it when it doesn't exist?

85
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,035
I've never put any letters
in the lunch box.

86
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,545
Are you sure your memories are back?

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,460
Yes.

88
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,295
I remember everything.

89
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,968
I know that I'm a scoundrel
and a good-for-nothing bastard.

90
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,637
But why do you say
you never wrote me a letter?

91
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,936
I remember everything.

92
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,652
Let's talk at home.

93
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,001
"Mr. Kim Sang-sik, make sure
you chew your food well."

94
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,509
"I'm too shy to say it,
so I'm writing it. I love you."

95
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,129
I memorized the whole thing.
Don't treat me like a fool!

96
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,098
If your memories are back, tell me

97
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,978
why you did that on that day.

98
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,242
Tell meâ¦

99
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,031
why you went to that mountain that night.

100
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,576
Were you really trying to kill yourself?

101
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,421
I said, were you really
trying to kill yourself?

102
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,923
TREATMENT NOTES

103
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,729
WRITE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW

104
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,808
I WANT TO KILL MYSELF

105
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,165
Don't cry.

106
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,764
Ms. Sook.

107
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,168
Don't cry.

108
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,394
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,260
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,617
What's gotten into you?

111
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,325
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

112
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,750
Do you think you can make me give up?

113
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,088
No way.

114
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,876
I will never live my life like this again!

115
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,679
Die? Why would I die?

116
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,927
I'm going to live past 100.

117
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,351
And don't sell this house. I tried so hard
to buy this house. Don't sell it.

118
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,612
Don't even try to hold me back
with this wretched house.

119
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,243
I'm not holding you back, so don't worry.

120
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,571
You remember when you were 22 years old?

121
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,080
Do you remember how you neglected our kids

122
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,501
to have an affair
and raise the other child?

123
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,080
Do you remember that?

124
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,039
You didn't have work,
but you didn't come home.

125
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,126
Your salary got cut in half.

126
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,461
Calls were hung up on me,
but you answered them.

127
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,297
You ran out night and day.

128
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,180
Why can't you remember that?

129
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,062
I hate it!

130
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,183
I hate it so much!

131
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,051
How did you hold it back all this time?

132
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,352
How could you bring yourself
to look at my face?

133
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,777
I've been holding back
because of the kids.

134
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,453
Iâ¦

135
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,249
I was done a long time ago.

136
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,379
All right.

137
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,141
I will get out of this house

138
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,024
and never show myself
in front of you again,

139
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,686
so you live here.

140
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,407
I promiseâ¦

141
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,083
I will never show myself to youâ¦

142
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,173
again.

143
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,978
Right when I thought I fell in love,

144
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:26,196
I heard another sound
that knocked on my heart.

145
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,076
And I badly wished for that sound

146
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,870
wasn't you.

147
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,214
You were the only one I could tell.

148
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,255
I made a mistake with the new vice CEO.

149
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,548
I think I fell for Mr. Playboy first.

150
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,143
We always go to his house.

151
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,848
We were actually trying
not to leave a trace.

152
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,389
I saw his girlfriend's photo.

153
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,182
If you decided to meet him,
then meet him alone.

154
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,437
Why bring in a woman who's not even there

155
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,109
and make it look like the three
of you are meeting?

156
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,818
Even if I told you so many things,

157
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,400
I really wished that

158
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,364
you wouldn't get to see this moment, ever.

159
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,095
Why do you feel like crap?

160
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,970
Who said I feel like crap?

161
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,727
Look at you.

162
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,848
You eat super fast whenever

163
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,976
you're upset or you feel like crap.

164
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,323
Did you go to Goheungâ¦

165
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,451
just with Ji-woo's oldest sister?

166
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,108
Without Eun-hee?

167
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,450
I mean, didn't Ms. Eun-hee go with you?

168
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,909
Why are you curious about that?

169
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,961
Even an idiot can tell.

170
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,961
I can tell that you are pretending.

171
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,381
I'm curious because I like you.

172
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,169
Yoon Seo-young.

173
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,295
You told my mom you'd be responsible
for me. I heard everything.

174
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,434
How can you interpret it like that?

175
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,471
You know that's not what I meant.

176
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,894
It does.

177
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,103
No one believed me, but you did.

178
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,193
Even my mom thinks I turned
my distinguished ex-boyfriend

179
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,189
into a rapist because I got dumped by him.

180
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,435
That's not true.

181
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,197
Your mother totally believes you.

182
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,448
She doesn't believe me.

183
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,450
She locked me up,
so I would never report him.

184
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,953
She made a mistake

185
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,874
but it was to protect you.

186
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,657
Protect me?

187
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,665
I've heard that far too many times.

188
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,375
I needed someone
who would believe me at the time.

189
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,465
That was you.

190
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,014
I still believe you
and will always be on your side.

191
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,354
That's why I totally fell for you.

192
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,396
Take care of me.

193
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,943
If this goes on, you can't work with me.

194
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,614
I won't work with you.

195
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,782
Right?

196
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,530
Sorry, telling you to take
responsibility was too much.

197
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,492
I'll get going for now.

198
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,954
See you tomorrow.

199
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,572
Hi, I'm Im Geon-joo.

200
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,146
Hi, I'm Kim Eun-joo.

201
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,236
Ms. Kim Eun-joo here is the eldest sister,
and I'm Kim Ji-woo, the youngest.

202
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,078
I see. I'm Im Geon-joo.

203
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,127
Right.

204
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,670
I'll get going now.

205
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,837
I should've called first,
though it's my sister's house.

206
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,756
-It's okay.
-Eun-joo, that's not what this is.

207
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,099
Ji-woo, see you next time.

208
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,433
Okay.

209
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,272
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay, bye.

210
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,404
Bye.

211
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,742
You said all of your romance cells died.

212
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,785
But that was so sweet.

213
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,787
"See you tomorrow."

214
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,535
Gosh, you cute little boy.

215
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,334
I'm so happy to see you.

216
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,555
Go make her sit.
She's looking for something to criticize.

217
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,849
Why did you go to Goheung?

218
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,436
-Me?
-You all went.

219
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,533
Eun-joo, you, and Chan-hyuk.

220
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,321
It's an odd group.

221
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,782
Why are you whispering, you punk?
You're making my ear rot.

222
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,907
I know.

223
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,163
-I know everything.
-What do you know?

224
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,339
I know that

225
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,257
you three went to Goheung together.

226
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,730
The 20 million won deposit
is all you have at your age?

227
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
How can you live
after you pay your rent every month?

228
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,066
-Do you have any debt?
-I have installment savings,

229
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,025
and I pay a national pension
as a citizen of Korea.

230
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,156
No need to worry.

231
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,326
If I can't handle itâ¦

232
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,291
I'll go back to Mom and Dad's house.

233
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,125
If so,

234
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,129
you should try to stop Mom and Dad
from graduating from marriage.

235
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,756
It seems the house is going to sell.

236
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,180
If they sell the house at their age,
they can't afford another.

237
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,854
At least stop them from selling the house.

238
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,472
Me?

239
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,024
Do you think Mom would listen to me?

240
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,560
You tell her. She always listens to you.

241
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,805
Why?

242
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,316
You can't say negative things to Mom
because you're always on her side?

243
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,071
So you know.

244
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,322
Here we go again.

245
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,319
I'm leaving.

246
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,581
This is the moment to catch a taxi.

247
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,671
You brat! Just run.

248
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,384
When I was your age,

249
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,550
I memorized the schedules
for the last subway.

250
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,419
When it was time even when I was drunk,

251
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,876
I levitated into the air and got on
the subway. Don't give it to him.

252
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,508
-You're spoiling him.
-Thank you.

253
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,255
-Hey!
-Bye.

254
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,143
Kim Ji-woo!

255
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,346
That littleâ¦ Damn it.

256
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,492
Was that man from earlier
the one you made a mistake with?

257
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,742
A mistake?
Did that bastard Chan-pal tell you?

258
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,033
You got drunk and told me,
crying like a baby.

259
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,078
Oh.

260
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,291
You're not in a situation
to worry about me.

261
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,995
If you work together,
then separate romance and business.

262
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,007
Don't depend on him.

263
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,838
Don't say, "Do this and that for me."

264
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,173
Date him independently.

265
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,468
Okay.

266
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,224
By the way, what made you
come to my house all of a sudden?

267
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,060
About Tae-hyungâ¦

268
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,435
About the issue between him and me.

269
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,405
Don't act like you know it.
It may take some time.

270
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,953
Well, I can't really

271
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,253
do anything about it.

272
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,077
Chan-hyuk told me

273
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,629
to call him
whenever I need someone to talk to.

274
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,009
If you let me borrow your friend,

275
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,644
I will gratefully use him
whenever I need him.

276
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,319
You should at least say
thank you to Chan-hyuk

277
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,454
for bringing him to that faraway place.

278
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,581
Even friends have to be polite
to each other.

279
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,041
Okay.

280
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,916
Have a safe trip back.

281
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,951
The caller cannot be reachedâ¦

282
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,571
CHAN-PAL

283
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,120
Call me please, I'm begging you.

284
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,668
Hi, Kim Eun-hee.

285
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,917
Look at you.

286
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,684
Why did you change your style
all of a sudden?

287
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,061
Are you back to being
a rich family's daughter?

288
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,930
It's not really a change.

289
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,437
I just put on
whatever I found in my closet.

290
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,441
These clothes are obviously new.
Why are you lying?

291
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,529
I reject the interview.

292
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,240
Take photos instead.

293
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,244
-Now, my hipâ¦
-Hi.

294
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,533
Goodness! That scared me.

295
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,367
You didn't seem to know I was watching.

296
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,002
Please continue.

297
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,461
Okay, again.

298
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,795
Ta-da! Now, the foot.

299
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,430
Chan-hyuk, are you ignoring
Eun-hee's calls?

300
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,515
Do you think I'm in a situation
to answer the phone?

301
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,731
Sorry.

302
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,811
Eun-hee keeps calling me
because you're not answering her calls.

303
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,188
Let's get ready. We might be late.

304
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,347
I got scared again

305
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,192
because your truck was here
but I couldn't find you.

306
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,364
Why are you looking at me

307
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,483
with such a sad face?

308
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,284
I left my house.

309
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,651
What?

310
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,776
Slept in the truck again?

311
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,789
I told you to play dumb.

312
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,458
To be frank, it seems like
you're still not completely sane.

313
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,078
Right?

314
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,708
So you need to tell me the truth.

315
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,128
What?

316
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,970
Was I a lunatic?

317
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,392
What are you talking about?

318
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,471
Why would I go there
at night if I wasn't insane?

319
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,480
A psychiatrist's clinic contacted me.

320
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,100
It seemed like I went regularly.

321
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,397
And Ms. Sook saidâ¦

322
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,068
I tried to kill myself.

323
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,534
Good griefâ¦

324
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,788
I deserve to die, actually.

325
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,498
She said I had an affair and a kid.

326
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,288
You know about it, donât you?

327
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,917
Tell me.

328
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,543
All right,

329
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,341
To be honest, you were kind of sneaky.

330
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,887
You didnât tell me much about you,

331
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,890
while I was telling you everything.

332
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,892
I thought that was a bit unfair.

333
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,359
Don't do that. I really hate that.

334
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,359
To be honest, I haven't
known you for decades.

335
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,362
You were always stuck in the truck
and were writing in a diary.

336
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,952
Read that diary.

337
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,414
A diary?

338
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,194
BANK TRANSACTIONS

339
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,950
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY

340
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,641
SANG-SIK, MAKE SURE
YOU CHEW YOUR FOOD WELL

341
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,393
I'M TOO SHY TO SAY IT IN PERSON.
I LOVE YOU.

342
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,749
Please wait.

343
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll get you the soup.

344
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,516
Mr. Kim Sang-sik,

345
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,942
make sure you chew your food well.

346
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,781
I'm too shy to say it, so I'm writing it.

347
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,372
I love you.

348
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,668
My goodness.

349
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,457
I didn't know he'd still remember that.

350
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,804
But amazingly enough,

351
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,893
as he recited the letter,

352
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,139
I remembered it, too.

353
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,561
Why was it so difficult

354
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,229
to say "I love you" and end up
being unable to do it?

355
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,692
What do you think of her husband,
who still remembers

356
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,322
the letter she threw away
in the middle of writing it until now?

357
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,029
Thank you.

358
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,004
I'll tell the kids.

359
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,752
Please be well.

360
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,592
The kids are not even interested in us.

361
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,353
You must be busy.
I'm going into a meeting.

362
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,895
Look how pathetic I am.

363
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,833
Why don't you go in first?

364
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,489
We might end up going in together.

365
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,497
That was my intention.

366
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,171
Sure.

367
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,297
We've become estranged these days.

368
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,385
Let's hang out on the weekend.

369
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,810
Do you only have me
to hang out with when you look this good?

370
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,194
I'm giving up a lot to hang out with you.

371
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,479
Oh, my.

372
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,312
Now, before we start the meeting,

373
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,187
if you have any proposals for me to check,

374
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,395
e-mail them to me, please.

375
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,423
I won't be coming here anymore.

376
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,342
I couldn't think of anyplace else.

377
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,184
I can give you only ten minutes.

378
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,479
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

379
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,357
I thought it'd be better
if Dr. Yoon told you first.

380
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,605
Your lover stole your money and left you,

381
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,573
and it seems like Dr. Yoon
is responsible for it.

382
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,160
Then should I say sorry, too?

383
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,461
You sound so cold.

384
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,625
When there's someone who thinks
there's no gay person around him or herâ¦

385
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,554
Do you know the reason?

386
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,684
It means he or she isn't trustworthy
enough to tell secrets to.

387
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,937
Should I repent for not being trustworthy?

388
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,188
Do you think you're always the victim?

389
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,645
We have to understand you
because you're a minority?

390
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,606
I don't even ask to be understood.

391
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,076
You must be busy.

392
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,238
You can go now.

393
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,388
You made that money working
all day long and lost it,

394
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,976
why not take the money from Tae-hyung?

395
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,192
You came to this neighborhood
for the money.

396
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,533
Will I care about nothing but
money like you two, after 10 years?

397
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,372
Eun-joo.

398
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,155
Have you ever been in love?

399
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,877
I was curious about the one
he chose by abandoning me.

400
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,924
But he was a married bastard,

401
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,215
deceiving everyone around him.

402
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,518
Dad!

403
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,693
It's so wide and high.

404
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,282
The steering wheel is as big as you are.

405
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:38,906
Dad.

406
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,616
When you said your memories came back,

407
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,247
did Mom ask you about what happened

408
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,337
in the mountain?

409
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,255
We both didn't say much about it.

410
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,942
Ji-woo only thinks
it was a hiking accident.

411
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,953
So we can't talk about it
when we go to Eun-joo's house

412
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,031
later today.

413
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,369
Dad.

414
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,964
Promise meâ¦

415
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,757
that you'll never do that again.

416
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,346
It was just an accident.

417
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,056
That's why I'm here right now.

418
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,814
It will never happen again.

419
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,730
Okay?

420
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,975
Okay.

421
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,908
I have a favor to ask you, Eun-hee.

422
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,490
Yes, ask your second daughter for favors.

423
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,333
The photo in the living room.

424
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,832
The photo of me and Ms. Sook.

425
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,246
Yes.

426
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,094
I'd like you to bring it, please.

427
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,419
Dad, are youâ¦

428
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,875
I'll explain when we get together later.

429
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,966
I'm sure Ms. Sook hates it.

430
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,761
I want to take care of it.

431
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,261
Please bringâ¦

432
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,637
the photo.

433
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,186
Okay.

434
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,517
Thank you.

435
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,815
"Ms. Sook"?

436
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,777
Still?

437
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,952
Dad.

438
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,124
Tell me about the day you took that photo.

439
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,036
That dayâ¦

440
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:54,254
Dad, you're still 22 years old, right?

441
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,506
That day was October 13, 1982.

442
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,514
Yes.

443
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,505
That photo is much older than I am.

444
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,978
That was the day
I proposed to your mother.

445
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,530
I did this at the coffee shop.

446
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,989
People looked at us,
so Ms. Sook quickly took the ring.

447
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,374
Ms. Sook is shy, you know.

448
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,997
That coffee shop
was the best one at the time.

449
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,831
It played good songs too.

450
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,497
It played Cho Yong-pil's songs.

451
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,956
Dad.

452
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,045
On that day,

453
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,678
I held Ms. Sook's handâ¦

454
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,557
for the first time.

455
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,395
It was so warm.

456
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,364
Dad.

457
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,649
Are your memories really back?

458
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,913
Yes.

459
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,416
Dad, this is the company I work at.

460
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,422
-Really? It's nice.
-Goodbye.

461
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,625
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

462
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,715
-It's nice.
-It is, isn't it?

463
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,223
This is my fatherâ¦

464
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,017
-My Dad.
-Hi.

465
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,481
-Dad, this is the vice CEO.
-I'm Im Geon-joo.

466
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,362
Nice to meet you.

467
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,694
You get to meet all of my family.

468
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,565
-Please look after her.
-Don't worry.

469
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,072
Dad, I'll go get my car.

470
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,818
Okay.

471
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,946
Okay, thenâ¦

472
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,243
Please take a look around.

473
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,156
Okay.

474
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,826
Patent Attorney Kim?

475
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,625
Hi.

476
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,920
I heard you started working again.

477
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,964
Nice to see you.
I heard you're freelancing.

478
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,432
Yes, I only work
with pharmaceutical companies.

479
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,218
You were the best in taking care of
troublesome cases, right?

480
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,814
Not staying a freelancer forever, right?

481
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,891
Come join us.

482
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,596
We'll treat you as a partner.

483
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,016
Look at me.

484
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,024
The CEO goes to KIPO herself.

485
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,994
So you got calls
from a few places already.

486
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,451
Did Lee Oh-jang call you, too?

487
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,116
-Yes.
-Don't go there.

488
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,869
Mr. Oh from LeeOhJang is gay.

489
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,464
He wore a flower-patterned suit to KIPO.

490
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,961
Does he have to show it?

491
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,134
Come to our office
and check out the atmosphere.

492
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,382
Come and see it, okay?

493
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,608
It feels like everyone

494
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,744
is laughing and talking
behind your back, right?

495
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,622
Don't act like you know everything,

496
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,618
like you're wise and not greedy.

497
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,660
Your face and the way
you talk make me sick.

498
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,327
Youâ¦

499
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,092
What did you think when I was
trying so hard to get pregnant?

500
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,588
I detested you.

501
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,013
It was detesting to see

502
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,681
you try so hard to have a family

503
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,759
when you hated them.

504
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,260
You hated your family. But ours is okay?

505
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,725
Did you need an elevation
of social status?

506
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,889
You're a snob.

507
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,557
EUN-JOO

508
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,977
TAE-HYUNG

509
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,804
Hello?

510
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,642
It's me.

511
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,675
Yes.

512
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,651
Forget what I said.

513
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,028
I think I was harsh on purpose.

514
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,617
Hello?

515
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,994
Come and wrap things up.

516
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,503
The clinicâ¦

517
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,286
and usâ¦

518
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,628
Let's wrap everything up.

519
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,008
Let's be friends.

520
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,144
You told me what it means

521
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,763
to be a friend.

522
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,353
Guess which person is referred to as

523
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,145
"Someone who carries your sadness
on his or her back"

524
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,480
in Native American.

525
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,574
A parent?

526
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,073
No.

527
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,408
I don't think they can do that.

528
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,534
It's a friend.

529
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,986
That's how Native Americans
define friends.

530
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,997
Would there really be a friend
who carries my sadness

531
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,460
on his or her back?

532
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,342
You.

533
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,897
TAE-HYUNG

534
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,794
You carry my sadness on your back.

535
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,547
I'll carry your sadness on my back.

536
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,370
Really? This is your first time
coming to this house?

537
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,170
Want to help Eun-joo,
or hang out with Dad?

538
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,303
Dad, when you're hereâ¦

539
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,921
You have to go see the terrace.

540
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:37,837
Really?

541
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,887
Is it true that this is Dad's first time
coming to your house?

542
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,976
I invited him a few times,
but he refused, saying he's busy.

543
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,864
Then he should've never come at all.

544
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,816
No, you stay here.
Don't leave this house. Make it yours.

545
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,945
Dad. Ji-woo.

546
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,281
Time to eat.

547
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,695
Go ahead, Dad.

548
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,504
Okay.

549
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,499
My eldest daughter,

550
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,844
you and I have the same taste in food,

551
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,342
and we have the same eyes.

552
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,425
You're smart, and you can do anything.

553
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,563
Hey.

554
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,139
What's wrong?

555
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,146
You must be so happy.

556
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,361
But then, why don't Ji-woo
and I have double eyelids?

557
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,860
Does that mean we're not your kids?

558
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,739
I get super thick double eyelids
when I'm tired.

559
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,115
Really? Have you ever been tired
in your entire life?

560
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,543
I've never seen
any double eyelids on your eyes.

561
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,792
Is your husband eating dinner out?

562
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,715
He said he was going to be
very late, so I didn't tell him.

563
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,262
Dad, what's your dream?

564
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,932
My dream?

565
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,851
Eating with my eldest daughter,
second daughter,

566
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,360
and youngest like this often.

567
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,769
That's my dream.

568
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,067
Come on, something besides that.

569
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,491
You were 22 years old.

570
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,355
I'm asking
what your dream was at the time.

571
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,702
Oh.

572
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,583
Dream.

573
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,964
My dreamâ¦

574
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,417
I never told this to anyone, butâ¦

575
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,891
Competing in the Campus Song Festival.

576
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,217
Even if you are good

577
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,057
at playing the guitar,
playing the harmonica, or singing,

578
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,234
you can't compete
if you aren't in college.

579
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,154
It was a dream. A far-away dream.

580
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,028
So that's why you always listened
to Campus Song Festival songs.

581
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,993
Dad, then can you play the guitar
and the harmonica too?

582
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,874
No, what's the point of learning
when I'm not in college?

583
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,303
Your mother must be eating alone again.

584
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,598
Shall I call her?

585
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,272
No.

586
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,902
I asked you to gather
so I can tell you about it.

587
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,618
Iâ¦

588
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,581
left the house.

589
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,920
Don't make such faces.

590
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,223
It's nothing, really.

591
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,684
I'm undereducated and ignorant

592
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,966
compared to you kids,

593
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,636
so I don't know how to put this, butâ¦

594
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,772
Nothing is going to change.

595
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,105
I'll be the only one missing.

596
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,993
So, Ji-woo,

597
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,406
take care of your mother
and listen to her.

598
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,294
The same goes for you two, okay?

599
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,521
I saw your purse and manuscript
on your desk, so I waited.

600
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,305
Glad to see me?

601
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,935
I am glad to see you.

602
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,780
Butâ¦

603
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,065
I really have to work.

604
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,033
Tomorrow's my day off,
so I'll work until late.

605
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,075
Yes, relax and work. I'll work, too.

606
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,699
Don't feel burdened.

607
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,327
All right.

608
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,081
Did your father leave?

609
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,706
Yes, there was a place
to park his truck here.

610
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,545
Your father had palms as hard as a rock.

611
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,967
It reminded me of my father.

612
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,734
Now I only have to meet
your mother, right?

613
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,436
Go and do your work.

614
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,685
Okay.

615
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,963
There were two bouquets on that day.

616
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:52,303
At the wedding photographers
get to see and hear a lot of things.

617
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,284
CHAN-PAL

618
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,542
All right.

619
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,826
Tell me

620
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,336
why you were looking
at your phone all day.

621
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,128
I'll do the counseling.

622
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,376
You always say that.

623
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,006
Wellâ¦

624
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,680
My friend is totally ignoring
my texts and calls.

625
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,595
So you did something wrong?

626
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,443
Why do you think so?

627
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,272
I can feel it from how you say it.

628
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,147
"My friend is totally ignoring me,
but I cannot give up."

629
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,275
"Why? Because I did something wrong."

630
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,242
Do you want to apologize?

631
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,197
I don't think it requires an apology.

632
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,445
Your friend gets to decide on that.

633
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,583
Don't just call your friend,

634
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,575
but go visit them to show some effort.

635
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,337
The counseling is over.

636
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:14,969
Now, as a man.

637
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,509
I don't want to be a man
who's jealous of your friend.

638
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,387
So,

639
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,024
apologize to him and come to me.

640
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,111
Okay, I will.

641
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,909
Whatever.

642
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,387
Who is it?

643
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,265
It's me, Ji-woo.

644
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,139
Hey.

645
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,020
What time is it?

646
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,267
I want this place to be my room,
not my office, until 8:00 a.m.

647
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,317
I donât like employees
who come to work too early.

648
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,032
I don't like companies
where I have to come to work on weekends.

649
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,324
If you're tired, get more sleep.

650
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,919
What's going on with you?

651
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,924
Chan-hyuk,

652
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,002
I thought about it all night long.

653
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,797
You and I should act like
we don't know Eun-joo's secret.

654
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,263
We've been doing that.

655
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,473
But why all of a sudden?

656
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,392
Our father summoned us
to Eun-joo's house yesterday.

657
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,933
Why all of a sudden?

658
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,941
My Mom and Dad graduated from marriage.

659
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,033
Goodness.

660
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,570
Let's skip that part for now.

661
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:05,833
Dad was looking at Eun-joo during dinner,
with so much love in his eyes and said,

662
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,156
"My eldest daughter and I
have the same taste in food,

663
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,996
and we have the same eyes."

664
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,093
He was talking like he's her real father.

665
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,958
You should've seen his eyes.

666
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,165
I could see hearts
popping out of his eyes.

667
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,415
It was genuine.

668
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,506
Yes.

669
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,215
The biological DNA provider
isn't that important.

670
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,137
Both of us should forget about it.

671
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,900
What if you heard it wrong?

672
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,948
Yes, I heard it wrong.
Let's wrap it up that way, Chan-hyuk.

673
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,945
-Chan-hyuk.
-What now?

674
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,913
Why do you keep ignoring Eun-hee's calls?

675
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,794
She's harassing me.

676
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,500
The timing isn't right, that's all.

677
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,004
You're ignoring her calls
after the trip to Goheung.

678
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,419
Why did the three of you go to Goheung?

679
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,714
You three went,

680
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,717
and you came back with Eun-joo,
leaving Eun-hee there?

681
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,433
Long ago, you could get punished

682
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,095
for saying the Earth is round.

683
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,314
-All of a sudden?
-Also,

684
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,185
tobacco was believed to be healthy.

685
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,442
Chan-hyuk, be serious.

686
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,574
The truth will eventually
be revealed after some time.

687
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:27,372
For now, all three of us
will not give you an answer.

688
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,779
And when that's the case

689
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,947
the polite thing to do is to wait
without asking any more questions.

690
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,419
I see.

691
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,504
Okay, I wonât ask anymore.

692
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,340
You really are

693
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,051
the best.

694
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,091
I should've let the world know about it.

695
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,795
It's so sad I couldn't do that.

696
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,215
Eun-hee has a bad taste in men.

697
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,514
I want a guy like you
to be my brother-in-law

698
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,768
-and have a drink with--
-Hey.

699
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,980
What about my opinion?
You don't care at all?

700
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,574
Now, when we film the unboxing,
we need to follow the products.

701
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,648
Divide the screen into three sections

702
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,074
and make sure it's two-thirds filled up.

703
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,033
Okay.

704
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,240
-Okay, ready?
-Yes.

705
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,405
-Now, please begin.
-Okay.

706
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,883
{\an8}-How's my no makeup face?
-It's pretty.

707
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,340
I mean, it's okay.

708
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,717
EUN-HEE

709
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,125
-CEO, where are you going?
-Donât make sudden sounds.

710
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,343
Edit it out.

711
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,972
CEO, where are you going?

712
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,222
I'm going to buy lunch and bring it to go.
I'll choose the menu.

713
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,445
Your company must be doing well.

714
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,200
You're busy on weekends too.

715
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,244
That's why I told them I'm getting lunch

716
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,746
for the employees working on the weekends.

717
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,329
You know it's annoying
when the food comes late, right?

718
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,210
What do you want?

719
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,378
This place must have good food.
They have a lot of to-go orders.

720
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,764
Makes me want to drink.

721
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,634
Get to the point.

722
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,885
I really want to know
why you're ignoring my calls and texts.

723
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,144
Because I'm tired.

724
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,941
Are you tired because of work,
something else,

725
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,476
or me?

726
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,189
Of course, it's you.

727
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,485
What's with the "of course" added to it?

728
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,491
They say you should give up
if your heart doesn't flutter.

729
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,993
-Are you treating me like an object?
-It's a metaphor.

730
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,118
The point of that expression

731
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:25,788
is about getting rid of objects or clothes
you didnât use for more than a year.

732
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,467
We cut ties for so many years, remember?

733
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,297
It's possible for us to curse and yell,

734
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,425
whenever we feel bad again,

735
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,640
and cut ties again as well.

736
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,230
Once is difficult.
It's easier the next time.

737
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,069
I donât want to waste
my energy on a relationship

738
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,821
that is so volatile.

739
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,245
But you know, my friend,

740
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,118
think outside the box.

741
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,749
You've been totally ignoring
my calls and texts,

742
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,543
but I didn't get angry.

743
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,667
I'm being really careful and modest.

744
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,344
I came here myself.

745
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,432
Isn't that because you thought
you've been overreacting these days

746
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,509
and repented, right?

747
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,223
Right. I repent my actions very well.

748
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,354
And do you know why I repented so quickly?

749
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,060
It means I don't want
that relationship in which

750
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,516
I can cut ties with you again.

751
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,900
I'm going to keep
seeing you, contacting you,

752
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,239
and be on good terms with you, my friend.

753
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,368
Sir, here's your order
of four hangover soups to go.

754
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,613
Anyway, let's not contact
each other for a while.

755
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,228
For a while?

756
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,725
You asked me to take care of Eun-joo.

757
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,607
It seems that you knowing about it

758
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,065
makes her uncomfortable.

759
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,235
If she needs someone,
she said she's going to contact me,

760
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,116
so let's do that
until Eun-joo settles things down.

761
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,131
Okay, for a while then.

762
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,086
I won't ask either, for a while.

763
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,045
Please take care of

764
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,684
my sister.

765
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,017
By the way, my brother doesn't like
hangover soup.

766
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,363
You bastard who has no respect
for your employees.

767
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:53,864
Bye.

768
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,248
Are you taking your car out?

769
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:53,002
-Mom.
-Oh, my goodness.

770
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,844
What brings you here without calling?
Have you eaten?

771
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,590
You asked Eun-hee to call me.

772
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,432
I was thinking about getting
your father checked up one more time,

773
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,600
but since his memories are back,
there's no need to.

774
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,179
It's dusty.

775
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,266
Go inside.

776
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,033
Did Tae-hyung get better?

777
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,566
What?

778
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,195
I heard he's not well.

779
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,873
Yes, he's fine.

780
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,211
Is something going on?

781
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,211
You look terrible.

782
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,892
And you got skinnier.

783
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,427
What if

784
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,600
you're ill?

785
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,521
-Did you go see a doctor?
-No.

786
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,064
That's not what it is.

787
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:02,487
By the way, you came here
on the day Tae-hyung's clinic

788
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,450
is closing earlyâ¦

789
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,784
I heard from Dad.

790
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,753
Don't sell the house.

791
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,165
Ji-woo isn't capable of
moving out, either.

792
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,589
All right.

793
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,642
Have you eaten lunch?

794
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,719
I'm hungry. Want to eat with me?

795
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,653
Mom, why didn't you thank me
even once at the time?

796
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,442
What?

797
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,533
When I was working as a temporary teacher

798
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,284
and was tutoring on weekends.

799
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,157
Each day was so long and tiring,
but when I realized it,

800
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,287
it'd been a month already,

801
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,579
and when I realized it

802
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,409
a season had passed.

803
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,375
I don't remember
how I lived my life at the time.

804
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,589
I wasted my days in my twenties like that.

805
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,926
Why are you suddenlyâ¦

806
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,471
Whyâ¦

807
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,061
Why are you bringing that up?

808
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,679
I'm just curious.

809
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:20,062
"My daughter, you're doing so much."
"Thank you, my daughter."

810
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,689
I'm asking why you never
said those things to me.

811
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,834
On the day I met Tae-hyung's mother
for the first time,

812
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,493
she held my hand

813
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,286
and thanked me for being
part of her family.

814
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,286
I've been curious since then.

815
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,458
About why you never said that to me.

816
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,591
You wereâ¦

817
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,138
particularly cold

818
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,894
to me and Dad.

819
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,897
I never knew

820
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,056
that you were

821
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,443
bottling that up until now.

822
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,816
Yes.

823
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,027
It's all my fault.

824
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,157
I want an answer.

825
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,036
I don't want to blame anyone.

826
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,583
I just want to know why.

827
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,883
Becauseâ¦

828
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,184
it's too easy to say

829
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,184
so I couldn't say it.

830
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,902
When I saw girls your age

831
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,071
wearing makeup, and pretty clothes,

832
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,783
and walking on the street,

833
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,571
it broke my heart.

834
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,539
At that time, you didn't talk,
smile, or laugh.

835
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,502
You never took a taxi

836
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,205
when you were going to work early

837
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,958
or working late.

838
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,257
You only wore cheap clothes,

839
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,801
and your shoes were worn out.

840
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,686
How could I say thank you?

841
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,688
That's so shameless.

842
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,606
How could I say I'm sorry?

843
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,487
When I couldn't do anything for you.

844
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,076
What useâ¦

845
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,575
do words have

846
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,333
when they're just words?

847
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,345
Mom.

848
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,194
I have something to tell you.

849
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,773
Yes.

850
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,609
Before I got married,

851
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,364
Dad came to my workplace.

852
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:22,003
-Happy birthday dear Yu-jeong
-Happy birthday dear Yu-jeong

853
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:26,173
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

854
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,670
Blow out the candles.

855
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,919
Did you make a wish?

856
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,010
JUNE 13, EUN-JOO'S BIRTHDAY

857
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,848
I never cared about her birthday, anyway.

858
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,293
October 13, 1982.

859
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,665
That was the day
I proposed to your mother.

860
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,045
Eun-joo was in Mom's womb at the time.

861
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:17,051
On that day, I held Miss Sook's hand

862
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,298
for the first time.

863
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,972
Anxiety knocks on my heart again.

864
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,145
November 14â¦

865
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,780
December 14â¦

866
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,316
January,

867
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:39,492
February, March, April, Mayâ¦

868
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,785
June.

869
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,713
Ms. Kim Eun-hee?

870
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,217
Why tell me the secret
between you two after all this time?

871
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,554
Do you know what I regret?

872
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,675
You wanted to be friends.

873
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,221
Just live here as a friend.

874
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,595
Coy, but not too much.

875
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,101
Should I gift it to you?

876
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,483
Chan-hyuk ignored your calls.

877
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,729
That's a signal
telling you to keep boundaries.

878
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,101
She's your friend, but she knows nothing.

879
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,058
I liked her because I knew nothing.

880
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,688
Young-sik? Why are you looking for him?

881
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,485
He said this was the day
he held your hand for the first time.

882
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,446
I get it now.

883
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:08,157
