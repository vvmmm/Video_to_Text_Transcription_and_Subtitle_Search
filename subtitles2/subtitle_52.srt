ï»¿1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,480
Hey! You!

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,565
I'm onto you.
I know all about you.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,684
What's all this for?

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,973
We was done last week.
Why us again?

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,807
Quit moaning, Harry.

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,541
You. Out.

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,411
Move!

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,575
Sorry, Mr. Jackson.
Just saying hello.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,779
Right, that's it.
Get this lot packed up.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,344
Get sorted.

11
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,253
What have you got
with you, then?

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,484
Any money?
Phone cards?

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,584
Have you got stuff
you can trade, have you?

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,787
Bastards.

15
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,853
Right, Brinkley, shut it.

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,895
I am not sick!

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,598
Down on your knees.

18
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:44,441
Get... down... on... your... knees!

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,241
Seen enough?!

20
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,374
You want some more?!

21
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,509
Okay!

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,898
One of the reasons
they're going to release me

23
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,518
is that they don't know
anything about the divorce.

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,994
I can't keep on waiting.

25
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,465
But you've got to sign the deeds
over to me.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,460
Harry Reynolds
and Steven Wolton, seven years,

27
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,437
Victor Braithwaite, 11 years.

28
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,666
Bloody hell.

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,866
What about Kelly?

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,074

31
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,624
Liam, come here.

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,621
Look up here.
Give me a bump.

33
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,600
Right.
You have the thing?

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,862
- Yeah.
- Touch me.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,959
Boom.

36
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,436
Check me.

37
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,302
That's cool.

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,776
Learning something interesting,
Brian?

39
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,713
Hello, Mr. Gordon.

40
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,183
Down you come, you wee tosser.
Now.

41
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,590
So have they given you
an exact date?

42
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,957
The secure unit
will be completed on schedule.

43
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,792
Security's still a hazard,
though, isn't it?

44
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,992
Is there any truth in the rumor
that we may be privatized?

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,831
It is exactly that,
Ms. Hewitt... just a rumor.

46
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,662
Barfield's cost the government
too much money

47
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,400
to let it go
to private contractors.

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,932
I would've thought that was just
the reason to recoup the losses.

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,320
I'd keep the hard hat on,
Mr. Bunny.

50
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,835
It suits you.

51
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,806
Good morning.

52
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,315
Good morning.

53
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,546
Good morning, ma'am.

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,454
Bloody hell.

55
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,665
Ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,352
will the new personnel sit
in the front seats?

57
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,818
As quickly as possible, please.

58
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,703
Deputy Governor Gary Marshall,
HOC... head of custody.

59
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,505
Now, these two wings, C and D,
the block and the VP Wing

60
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,509
are now secure

61
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,069
until this section of wall
is reopened to the new wings.

62
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,448
Control unit there, and this
is the maximum-security unit.

63
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,850
Ma'am?

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,814
As you must all be aware,
the refurbishment

65
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,256
has advanced somewhat
in the past months,

66
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,522
but until the security system
is fully operational,

67
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,120
we still have
major at-risk areas.

68
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,665
We'll also be expecting a new
HHC... head of health care...

69
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,397
And a full-time doctor
in residence.

70
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,369
Ah.

71
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,203
And Ms. Collins will be
our resident psychologist

72
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,274
and drama coach.

73
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,534
Maureen Collins.

74
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,078
Sorry if I kept everyone
waiting.

75
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,009
You didn't,
but I'm sure you'll catch up.

76
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:35,879
Right.

77
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,214
Now, this morning I intend
to take all the new personnel

78
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,776
on a grand tour of the prison.

79
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,085
So if you have to use it,
sterilize it.

80
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,149
Better still,
don't bloody use it.

81
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,419
Okay.
That's all for this morning.

82
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,795
Come on, guys.
Move it!

83
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,959
Should never have brought him
back to Barfield.

84
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,902
Well, they have done,
and we've got to deal with him.

85
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,735
You got six
for protecting a nonce.

86
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,900
I got six for doing a nonce in.

87
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,975
Yeah.

88
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,978
Big boy now, are you?

89
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,638
Coffee?

90
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,511
You didn't hear me right.

91
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,175
Victor was the nonce.

92
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,446
You protected the nonce.

93
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,511
He's back on D Wing.

94
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,250
Oi.

95
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,020
Stop nattering and move along.

96
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,932
You want some advice?

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,829
You seem to be trying to get
some credit.

98
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,864
You have to deal with Victor.

99
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,804
He owes you.

100
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,807
- Morning.
- Morning.

101
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,077
Morning, ma'am.

102
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,018
Dr. Thomas, this is John Udding,
who's been working at Liverpool.

103
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,681
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Peters,
Mr. James,

104
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,054
Mr. Boyd, and Mr. Hood.

105
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,285
Look at this.

106
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,225
God knows how they're gonna
sterilize it.

107
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,956
The rubber
at the end of the plunger

108
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,158
has disintegrated completely
through constant use.

109
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,928
Instead of a rubber,

110
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,163
they're using
a small piece of black polythene

111
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,171
from a dustbin liner,

112
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,571
wrapped and held in place
with a piece of cotton thread.

113
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,974
It's madness, isn't it?

114
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,978
- Uh...
- Yeah.

115
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:16,415
Until the authorities admit
that we have a drug problem,

116
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,318
I can't instigate
methadone programs.

117
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,356
I'm not allowed
to supply needles,

118
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,050
so all that we can do

119
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,821
is to try and teach the users
to sterilize the needles

120
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,828
that they are
somehow bringing in.

121
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,194
I have tried sniffer dogs.

122
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,755
I have had cell searches.

123
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,701
And somehow,
the stuff is still coming in.

124
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,271
Fisher, come here.

125
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,044
You got to report
to the probation department.

126
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,943
You think I'd forget?

127
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,982
Finally come through.

128
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,381
What?

129
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,316
He's got home leave.

130
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,150
Sewing section
with four machines.

131
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,958
Uh, this isn't finished yet, but
it will be the music section.

132
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,292
Numerous instruments.

133
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,301
And this area here is earmarked
to be a recording studio.

134
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,631
Only needs one of them to blow

135
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,247
and there's a few hundred grand
down the toilet.

136
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,672
They've got one each per cell.

137
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,510
Um, all the corridors
and main areas

138
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,910
are monitored
with a central locking system,

139
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,176
which is operated
from the control room.

140
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,649
Want my personal opinion?

141
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,912
When the inmates see them,

142
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,920
you'll get a few
Des O'Connor impersonations

143
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,183
and a lot of aggravation.

144
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,724
Ms. Collins?

145
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,222
The gymnasium is not in use yet,

146
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,855
but as you can see,
we are fully equipped.

147
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:43,029
We also have, um, new indoor
squash and netball courts

148
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,268
and a new outdoor, floodlit
Astroturf football pitch.

149
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,002
And if they twist a muscle,

150
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,254
they can put their name down
for a physiotherapy session.

151
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:54,407
Not be in use until
the prison is officially open.

152
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,972
Remind you of a health farm yet?

153
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,994
It's a bit of a waste, isn't it,
if it's finished?

154
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,919
The security isn't, Ms. Collins.

155
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,978
If you'd like to follow me.

156
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,320
You're going out on trust, Alan.

157
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,019
You know the rules.

158
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,392
We will accept no excuses
if you are not back at Barfield

159
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,159
before 10:00 on Sunday evening.

160
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,700
I will be, Governor.

161
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,469
I know how important it is.

162
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,298
I'll lose my parole date

163
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,242
and the possible transfer
to an open prison nearer home.

164
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,846
So, any I should be
extra wary of?

165
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,385
Cell 47.
Kid called Kelly.

166
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,978
Got a six
on top of his sentence.

167
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,831
I reckon he might want to try
and hurt himself,

168
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,809
so we've got him next to one
we're extra wary of...

169
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,699
Norman Jones.

170
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,276
Keep an eye on them both.

171
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,214
Roddy Marsh.
C2.

172
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,413
He's always checked
through the night.

173
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,223
Self-mutilator... and a bad one.

174
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,454
Right, Fisher.

175
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,588
Gray suit.

176
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,461
Brown shoes.

177
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,701
White shirt.

178
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,035
Tie.

179
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,337
Looks a bit creased.

180
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,343
I don't know.

181
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,811
Going out to see your wife
and kids.

182
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,939
You look like a dosser.

183
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,246
How much would a new one
set me back?

184
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,581
You mean like this?

185
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,419
At least 20 quid, right?

186
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,018
Maybe more.

187
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,528
Twenty quid?

188
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,256
It's yours, you great clod.

189
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,928
Go on.
We had a whip-round for you.

190
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,934
Not all screws are bastards,
Fisher.

191
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:02,975
Go on.

192
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,754
You'd better have this
to hold your pants up.

193
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,337
You've got no belt.

194
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
And here.

195
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,684
Belonged to my uncle.

196
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,151
It's in perfect nick,

197
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,487
and as you're going out of one,
I thought you might need it.

198
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:32,838
Thank you.

199
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,472
Thank you very much.

200
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,972
Thank you.

201
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,381
Overloading the RAM
can cause problems.

202
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,717
If you don't back up all this
data onto your hard disk...

203
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,655
Officer Johnson, Gate 2.

204
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,262
Hi.
Is this the first section?

205
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,795
Have a nice weekend, Mr. Fisher.

206
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,640
Senior Officer Russell Morgan,

207
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,840
Zania Smith, assistant
to education department.

208
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,213
Quiet!

209
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,276
If you want to get started, this
place is bulging at the seams.

210
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,682
Zania, is it?

211
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,622
They'll be searched, all right.

212
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,955
I'll leave you to it.

213
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,058
Bollocks.

214
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,798
Shit!
This can't keep happening!

215
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,802
First let me get to know
who each of you are.

216
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,805
Oh, I'd love to get to know <i>you,</i>
sweetheart.

217
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,869
And let me let you know
straight from the start

218
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,911
that I will take
no sexist remarks...

219
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,315
no racial remarks.

220
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,979
You are here to be educated.

221
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,853
If you want to waste your time
and my time, you will be out.

222
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,858
Is that understood?

223
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,555
Right.

224
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,461
I know some of you are hoping to
take Open University degrees

225
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,307
and that due to the closure
of this department

226
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,475
you're behind on your studies.

227
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,195
Will you stop talking?

228
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,201
You.

229
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,261
Let the woman speak, man.

230
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,206
Hey, I see you have one
of my brothers on your team now.

231
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,437
Watch out, now.

232
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,069
Shut up and get down
to association.

233
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,579
Hey, what is it with you?

234
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,548
You have a problem.
You know that?

235
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,079
Oi.
Malahide.

236
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,646
They're letting the coons in
now, are they?

237
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,334
Thought I could smell something
on the wing.

238
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,954
Hey, Braithwaite,
you big ugly pussyhole, you.

239
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,395
You're gonna get
what you deserve.

240
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,692
You know that?

241
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,631
You'll get what you deserve.

242
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,998
I suppose you're used to that.

243
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,230
Victor Braithwaite.
You'll want to watch him.

244
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,603
A few months back, he got
11 years on top of his life.

245
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,437
He's not a happy man.

246
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,788
Four of them strung
an inmate up.

247
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:50,775
Hanged him.

248
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,903
Trauma suit cost a million quid.

249
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,107
Well, they get it on legal aid.

250
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,481
My mum can't get it just to take
her bastard landlord to court.

251
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,919
And I usually work with
the probation department,

252
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,924
as a lot of insight comes out
of the improvisation sessions.

253
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,357
Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,226
There <i>is</i> one thing I think I
should make clear

255
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,422
from the outset.

256
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,329
I like as little interference
as possible.

257
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,957
The group usually
functions better

258
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,633
if they feel
they're not being monitored.

259
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,466
I agree.

260
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,539
But I suggest that you also draw
in some of the other officers

261
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,577
to interact
in the improvisations.

262
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,872
I'm not averse to that.

263
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,139
I'm glad you're not.

264
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,218
We've had a lot of people sign
up for the education department.

265
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:38,054
I think that's mainly because of
the glamorous Ms. Zania Smith.

266
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,616
Not too many signed up for
your drama group, I'm afraid.

267
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,956
I'm sorry.
That sounded awful.

268
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,796
Right.
Is there anything else?

269
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,963
No.
I think I've covered everything.

270
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,398
Thank you.

271
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,577
Hey. Bet you there's
a swimming pool.

272
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,845
Any money on it.

273
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,783
Hey, Walter.
Have a look at this.

274
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,014
What do you think it is?

275
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,750
I don't know.
Nuclear bunker, maybe.

276
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,847
What?

277
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,826
What do they want
a nuclear bunker here for?

278
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,657
Let me down.

279
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,664
Brian, gwan, gwan, gwan, gwan.

280
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,859
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

281
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,629
What happened?

282
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,604
Touch me now.

283
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't know how glad I am
for see you.

284
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,205
We need all the brethren
inside here we can get.

285
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,339
You know what I mean?
Listen.

286
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,043
I can ask you something?

287
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,652
You can get me back onto C Wing?

288
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,630
Because there's an arsehole
here named Braithwaite

289
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,849
and he's pure aggravation.

290
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,220
You know what I mean?

291
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,259
- See what I can do.
- Thank you, brother.

292
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,090
- Just one thing.
- What's that?

293
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,323
I'm not your brother.

294
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,204
I hear you.

295
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,172
Cool.

296
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,401
But let's try and maintain
some kind of advantage.

297
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,909
You know what I mean?

298
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,000
Help each other...

299
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,816
All right, puppa.

300
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,913
All right.

301
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,383
All right.

302
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,797
Hey.

303
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,936
You pay up here.

304
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,544
Where to?

305
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,877
Oh.
Um, railway station.

306
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,780
That's 50 pence.

307
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,216
See that big stupid claat
over there?

308
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,385
I signed up for classes.

309
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,191
Kelly want him hit.
Ask around.

310
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,562
And it'll be cash.

311
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,301
And so easy,
especially if he's pissed.

312
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,703
Now, I want the whole wing
falling over drunk.

313
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,538
You understand me?
I tell you for why.

314
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,578
'Cause that pussy,
he's like an ox.

315
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,237
You know what I mean?

316
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,312
Hey.

317
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,808
You have any more gear, mate?

318
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,977
No, man. I'm concentrating
on the liquor now.

319
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,314
Hey, Rasta.

320
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,184
I'm gonna cut
your dreadlocks off.

321
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,247
Enjoy your dinner.

322
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,751
Hey, now you're getting
well above your station.

323
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,855
Hey!
On the people.

324
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,924
I ain't eating this shit,
you know.

325
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,937
Give me another tray.
Well, go on. Cha.

326
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,868
- Tucker.
- Thank you.

327
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:45,841
Yeah.

328
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,245
Dreadlocks there.
When was it last flipped?

329
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,646
I don't know.
Why?

330
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,082
The white slip says
your Rasta's dealing.

331
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,347
Tell your S.A.

332
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,911
Was it you
that tipped off that Rasta

333
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,889
we were gonna strip-search
his cell?

334
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,791
Is that how you're working it?

335
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,227
Want to make this personal,
then?

336
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,493
I mean, are you trying to say

337
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,468
that I'm showing favors
to blacks because I am one?

338
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,764
Is that what you're saying?

339
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,570
What I'm saying is
there's a lot more of us.

340
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,313
You've got the wrong attitude,
mate.

341
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,374
You think cons are sent here
for a bloody holiday.

342
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,920
Their punishment, man,
is being sent down...

343
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,819
Loss of freedom, full stop!

344
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:30,754
Oh, yeah?

345
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,189
Your sister gets raped.

346
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,193
How do you feel about him
coming in here,

347
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,523
taking frigging music lessons

348
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,621
and getting stoned
from your Rasta pals?

349
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,997
Um, is this a private bout
or can anybody throw a punch?

350
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,827
It was private, Governor.

351
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,031
Excuse me.

352
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,373
Governor.

353
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,843
Office, please.
Excuse me.

354
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,277
Have a good night.

355
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,081
You wanted to see me
about a white slip?

356
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,982
Somebody gave the tip-off

357
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,747
that a Rasta was drug dealing
on D Wing.

358
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,550
But...

359
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,147
But what?

360
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,782
Well, it could be racial.

361
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,689
Racial? No.

362
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,319
The whole point
about the white-slip box

363
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,660
is so that the complainant
can remain anonymous.

364
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,165
Said he's dealing in hard drugs.

365
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,258
I'll look into it.

366
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,438
I think you should look into
Mr. Malahide.

367
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,366
Yes. I did overhear
your conversation, Mr. Udding.

368
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,171
I want no racial tension
between my officers.

369
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,677
Understood?

370
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,545
You also said
that loss of freedom

371
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,607
is the prisoner's punishment.

372
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:37,252
I used to think like that,
but I've changed my mind.

373
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,722
Loss of freedom isn't enough.

374
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,957
If you haven't got the money
for the taxi, I'll collect you.

375
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,259
All right?

376
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,768
He's at the station.

377
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,309
Well, I'm out of here.

378
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,421
I'm not staying to see him.
I've got nothing to say to him.

379
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,505
If you don't want to see him,
you don't have to.

380
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,278
He's got a bloody cheek
even coming here.

381
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,909
I won't see him either,
you know.

382
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,955
We just want him to sign the
deed to the house over to us.

383
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,148
And the divorce papers.

384
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,487
Then none of us need see him
ever again.

385
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,379
Anyone who wants to
watch the football match,

386
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,848
the video starts
in five minutes.

387
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,093
- That's all.
- There's the video.

388
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,814
Will any prisoner
willing to assist in the library

389
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,946
also put their name down.

390
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,354
Any prisoner
willing to assist...

391
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,791
Come on!
Oh, sod this!

392
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,525
Put me down for the black chick
with the legs, will you?

393
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,827
What do you want, Brian?
Computer training?

394
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,766
Accountancy?
Economics?

395
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,768
Swivel on it.

396
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,747
If you can't read nor write,
Brian, what's the point?

397
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,536
- What's this drama thing about?
- Poofters.

398
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,774
Hey. Those seats are reserved.
Move it!

399
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,814
Got you a seat, Anthony.

400
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,281
Well, if I was you, son,
I'd sign up for something.

401
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,349
You got six years.

402
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,182
You could qualify to be a doctor
in the time you've got.

403
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,984
Aye, you're very cocky now,
eh, Kelly?

404
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,726
Come here, Bri.
Come here.

405
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,228
Come here.

406
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,710
Is that true what he said...
You can't read or write?

407
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,792
Course not.
He's just being a bastard.

408
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,996
Hang on, now.
Just listen.

409
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,163
There's special classes

410
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,797
for inmates
with learning disabilities.

411
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,967
I haven't got a disability!

412
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,806
Do you think I have one?

413
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:38,970
Suit yourself, son.

414
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,777
Go in and tell them Italy won
1-0.

415
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,410
Go on.
There's a good man.

416
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,316
Go in and tell them.

417
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,189
If I do this library schlep,

418
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,523
does that mean I don't have to
go to the workshop?

419
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,061
I've done it before, see?

420
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,597
In Wakefield and the Scrubs.

421
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,189
Library.

422
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,394
Sure.
Do you want me to check?

423
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,699
I'm not asking any favors.

424
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,370
What did Stormin' Norman want?

425
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,377
Oh, he wants to work
in the library.

426
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,935
Norman?

427
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,413
Oh, he wants off the workshop,
does he?

428
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,814
Complaining of headaches,
skiving bastard.

429
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,695
Well, it's Saturday.
There's no workshops.

430
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,814
- He's the only volunteer.
- Place your bets, lads!

431
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,221
Nobody's been allowed
to give them the result.

432
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,058
Norman doesn't get
any privileges, right?

433
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,562
You got that?

434
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,836
Italy won 1-0!
1-0!

435
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,159
Breakfast in a few minutes,
Alan.

436
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,450
That is the third
television set in six months.

437
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,622
They'll be lucky if they get
a black-and-white one.

438
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,964
- Morning.
- Morning.

439
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,470
I was just wondering
if you were free tonight.

440
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,664
Yes, I am.

441
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,708
Good. There's this nice
little Italian place.

442
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:53,472
Um... is it dressy?

443
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,778
No.
Well, it's semi-upmarket.

444
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,511
Uh, casual.

445
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,309
About 8:00?

446
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,285
Fine.
I look forward to it.

447
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,781
Have you found
my replacement yet?

448
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,851
Not yet.
A few weeks to go.

449
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,093
See you tonight.

450
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,866
You know where I am.

451
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,633
Only two days on call.

452
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,936
Oh, you're up.

453
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,342
Ron's just off to the garage.

454
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,074
Sleep all right, did you?

455
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,479
Fine.

456
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,278
Well, I'll see you later.

457
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,012
Ta-ra, June.

458
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,361
It's different.

459
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,571
Table used to be against
that wall, didn't it?

460
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,503
It's a different table, Alan.

461
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,311
And it's been decorated twice,
maybe more.

462
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,584
Tea?
Eggs and bacon?

463
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,451
Don't go to any trouble.

464
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,124
I lied.

465
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,931
Didn't sleep a wink.

466
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,300
Bed was too soft.

467
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,299
Not used to it, I suppose.

468
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,274
Can I have an omelet?

469
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,117
You've kept the house nice,
June.

470
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,858
I-I got this for you.

471
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,840
Your favorite, isn't it?

472
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,688
It's very smart.

473
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,527
Yes.
Well, Ron's a great help.

474
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:25,189
He's very handy
with cupboards and carpentry

475
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,823
and anything mechanical.

476
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,765
Surprised the social services

477
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,133
haven't copped the fact
he's been living here.

478
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,267
Maybe they reckoned
he was just a decorator.

479
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,671
I needed every penny
I could get.

480
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,577
I don't get subsidence now.

481
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,548
Ron's got his own garage.

482
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,481
And I own this house.

483
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,653
The girls.

484
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,893
Will I be able to see the girls?

485
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,898
They'll be working.

486
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,697
Sarah's got a job at a wine bar,

487
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,570
and Sue's at a new boutique
at the high street.

488
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,075
I know,
but that's not what I asked.

489
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,911
I'd like to see them.

490
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,073
They don't want to see you,
Alan.

491
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,678
I sort of looked forward
to seeing them, June.

492
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,919
And I'll sign the house over

493
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,482
and the divorce papers,
just like we agreed.

494
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,030
Just sit there.

495
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,850
- Ah. Ms. Collins.
- Morning.

496
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,274
Got a couple of helpers.

497
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:46,835
None of these are in any kind
of alphabetical order.

498
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,691
- I'm Maureen Collins.
- Oi. Where's that black chick?

499
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,479
- Shut it.
- Prisoner 872, Norman Jones.

500
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,550
C Wing, miss.

501
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,484
Well, Norman,
thanks for offering.

502
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,216
If, uh, you could start
unloading some of the boxes

503
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,621
over there.

504
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,355
And you are?

505
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,228
Uh...

506
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,994
Ooh.

507
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,729
Uh, I've got a migraine.

508
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,203
I-I think I'd better go back.

509
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,204
Sorry.

510
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,501
Come on.

511
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:22,246
Well, it's just you and me,
Norman.

512
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,492
Actually, if you could shift
that box over here

513
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,848
- and start unloading.
- Sure.

514
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,113
On here.

515
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,699
Hi.
Those are 50% off today.

516
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,799
It's me, Susie.

517
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,067
It's your dad.

518
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,979
I wouldn't have known you.

519
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,244
I recognized you straightaway.

520
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,710
Like your mother used to look.

521
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,716
I don't know what to say to you.

522
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,782
You don't have to say anything.

523
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,824
I was here.

524
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,592
Now I'm on my way.

525
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,825
I always loved you.

526
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,395
I'll never stop.

527
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,407
But I-I won't bother you.

528
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,944
Just wanted one last look.

529
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,438
No harm done, eh?

530
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,213
You did the harm.

531
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,783
I know.

532
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,880
And I have to live with it
for the rest of my life.

533
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,168
You know, I think we should try
and get the educational section

534
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,435
down one end,

535
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,410
the bodice-ripping novels
in another section.

536
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,412
- And then there's the...
- The classics?

537
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,710
Where do you want the classics?

538
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,250
Center shelves all along here.

539
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,580
Right.

540
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,647
You know they won't look
for a book.

541
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,781
They prefer to order
from the public library.

542
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,916
It gives them something to do.

543
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,484
Well, uh, that's the way
it was in the other nicks.

544
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,324
Sorry.

545
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,423
I must stink like a polecat.

546
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,736
What do you read, Norman?

547
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,206
Me?

548
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,766
A bit like Mike Tyson.

549
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,142
Well, according to the papers,
he reads Tolstoy.

550
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,340
I'm one ahead.
I read Dostoyevsky.

551
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:14,209
A man after my own heart
is Genet.

552
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,585
Refreshments.

553
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,196
You're a psychoanalyst,
aren't you, Ms. Collins?

554
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,030
No.
Psychologist.

555
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,704
You reckon any of the men
will read this one?

556
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,505
Margaret, Duchess of Argyll...
"Table Etiquette."

557
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,640
Well, we get what we're given,
Norman.

558
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,181
A bit like life, isn't it?

559
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,514
Ms. Collins, we've come
to take him back to the wing.

560
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,417
Thank you for your help.

561
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,522
I'll be in on Sunday.

562
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,498
If you'd like to give me a hand,
I'd be grateful.

563
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,600
The bastard's still not signed?

564
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,200
Well, when he comes back,
I'll talk to him.

565
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,473
One word from me or you,
and he's never going to get out.

566
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,672
He scares me, Ron.

567
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,776
- All right, Ron.
- Hey.

568
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,845
I've just been 'round
that new shopping mall.

569
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,857
Prices knocked me for six.

570
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,484
What sort of car is that
parked outside?

571
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,119
That's a Mazda.

572
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:36,291
Ron... I hope you don't mind.

573
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,665
I borrowed your razor.

574
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,975
What did I say, Ron?

575
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,740
One foot out of line,
and I'll call the police.

576
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,075
Come on, now.
Stop gassing. Come on.

577
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,744
Come on, you two.

578
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,258
How much should it cost for me

579
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,455
to have, uh, Victor Braithwaite
taken care of?

580
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,088
What are you asking me for?

581
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,826
It's just that everyone respects
you for knocking off a screw.

582
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,269
The only thing that I did...

583
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,735
was to destroy my life,

584
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,268
and I got 18 years
to think about it.

585
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,647
If you think
that deserves respect,

586
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,482
you need to get
straightened out.

587
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,858
Hey. It was him told me
Victor was a nonce.

588
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:40,228
So... feel even more of a prick
now, do you?

589
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,168
I own up.
I've been matchmaking.

590
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,082
- Hello.
- Good evening.

591
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,607
Would you like anything else?

592
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,735
Sir?

593
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,975
Sir?
Would you like another drink?

594
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,744
Ask the young lady to come
and serve me, will you, son?

595
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,013
Uh, yeah. Well, sir,
it's busy at the minute.

596
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,610
Perhaps I can get you
another Coke.

597
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,021
At Â£1.50?
You must be joking.

598
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,752
I'm her father,
so don't mess around.

599
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,658
Go and get her to speak to me.

600
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,663
I've seen you ringing up
wacky totals, son.

601
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,164
So just do it.

602
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,232
Bloke down there says
he's your father.

603
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,639
Okay.

604
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,807
I don't want to talk to you.
Just leave me alone.

605
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,010
I've been away, Sarah.

606
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,923
I just...
I just wanted to see you.

607
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,805
You've grown into a lovely girl.

608
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,260
No thanks to you.

609
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,236
You've got every right
to feel angry.

610
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,699
I've got every right to tell you
I don't want to see you.

611
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,629
Couldn't we just talk?

612
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:25,830
No.

613
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,131
I don't want any of my friends
knowing about you.

614
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,141
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,494
Excuse me.

616
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,691
Um, I wonder, could we, um,
have another wine please?

617
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,358
Thank you very much.

618
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:06,300
So we... we, uh, we had a very
one-sided, amicable divorce.

619
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,840
She got the house, the kids,
the car, and the savings,

620
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:16,184
and I got a bag of clubs
and two suitcases.

621
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,713
So... So she...
She was very amicable.

622
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,259
Oh, thank you.
No, no, no. I-I'll...

623
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,727
It's just that I know Barfield
were after a full-time doctor.

624
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,855
- I just thought...
- I don't get much time off,

625
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,763
and I didn't realize
this evening was set up

626
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,427
for me to interview
your replacement.

627
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,332
What about yours?

628
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,475
There was one time
when I was standing in

629
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,478
for this local doctor.

630
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,639
My what?

631
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,205
You said you were divorced.

632
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:48,083
And I wanted to make
a really good impression, so...

633
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,816
Very friendly, a long time ago,
I got the cat.

634
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,154
Ah.

635
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,354
She left me for my partner.

636
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,225
I'm sweating 'cause I couldn't
find the bloody farm.

637
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,994
I'm sorry?

638
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,695
She said I was always working.

639
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,169
Too bloody right I was.

640
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,696
Standing in for him so that he'd
have more time off for my wife.

641
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,299
Towards this immense
pregnant cow...

642
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,073
In the end, you know,
that's what gets you.

643
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,605
He hands me a bucket and says,

644
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,960
"Well, you can look at the wife
after if it makes you happy."

645
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,418
I'm sorry.
What gets you?

646
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,313
The betrayal.

647
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,925
Women are more deceitful
than men.

648
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,657
Dessert, madam?

649
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,760
Uh, nothing for me, thanks.

650
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,862
Oh. Um, I'll have
the trifle, please.

651
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,770
- Thanks.
- You're not on a diet, are you?

652
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,400
No.
Afraid I have to go home.

653
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,976
Excuse me.

654
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,479
I'm sorry.

655
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,980
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
about tonight.

656
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,841
You had me worried sick, Alan.

657
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,573
Where have you been?

658
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,114
Everything's changed.

659
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,554
And these.
Three quid.

660
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,456
Used to be 10 bob.

661
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,358
You want salt and vinegar
or anything?

662
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,294
No.
No, thanks.

663
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,124
I threw that in for nothing.

664
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,438
We don't get chips often.

665
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,212
I don't belong here.

666
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,682
I know that.

667
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,453
It's just hard.

668
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,855
I haven't got anyone to blame.

669
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,090
Come in, Ron.

670
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,770
Sit down, have a chip.

671
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,234
You've done well by my girls.

672
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,839
I appreciate it.

673
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,777
I don't suppose you've got
a beer in that fridge, have you?

674
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,254
No.

675
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,923
There's never any drink
in this house.

676
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,726
I won't be bothering you again.

677
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,739
Be all over by tomorrow.

678
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,153
Good heavens.

679
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,717
- This all your doing?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,923
They brought me in
after breakfast.

681
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:23,162
I've just got this case and, uh,
one on the far side to finish.

682
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,567
They're all, uh,
in alphabetical order.

683
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,970
And the magazine rack's sorted.

684
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,877
Strange, isn't it, the reading
material they allow in here.

685
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,544
Real-life detective.

686
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,879
Murder stories.

687
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,010
You'd think it would be banned.

688
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,055
And some of it
is pretty horrific...

689
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,784
Rape, torture...

690
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:50,120
mutilation, sexual deviations.

691
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,089
Still, life is full
of incongruities, isn't it?

692
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,733
Yes.

693
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,599
Have you done something
different with your hair?

694
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,609
No.
No, I've just had a shower.

695
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,146
These drama classes
you're starting...

696
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,273
Do you play those head games?

697
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,748
Not sure what you mean.

698
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,153
Well, act out your mother,
father, yourself.

699
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,213
That's what most of them do...

700
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,815
Shout a lot and wait
for the primal scream.

701
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,691
It <i>can</i> be therapeutic.

702
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,730
And give an insight
into the mind of someone

703
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,164
who finds it difficult
to communicate.

704
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,031
Answer me this.

705
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,795
Suppose you get a prisoner

706
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,306
who during the course
of one of these classes

707
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,241
lets out that he was
an abused child

708
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,335
and that that is
the fundamental seed

709
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,437
of all his criminal activities.

710
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,646
Well, what can you do?

711
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,449
You can't release him.
You can do nothing.

712
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,852
The damage is done.

713
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,050
Well, I disagree.

714
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,719
I can make him come to terms
with the abuse,

715
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,193
help him be able to adjust.

716
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,924
Adjust to what?

717
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,557
Eight, ten more years?

718
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,397
I'm gonna take him back
to the wing.

719
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,468
It's lunch.

720
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,806
Tell me this.

721
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,400
What kind of man
would out of choice choose

722
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:16,073
to work in a prison all day
locked up,

723
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,514
even if he does have the keys?

724
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,245
Still, I guess, behind bars.

725
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,810
Were you abused?

726
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,480
No.

727
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,581
But I knew you'd ask me that.

728
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:31,053
You haven't read up on me,
have you, Ms. Collins?

729
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,753
No.

730
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,526
Time to go back on the wing,
Norman.

731
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:40,881
Where do you want
the Kama Sutra?

732
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,771
Now, Norman. Come on.

733
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,241
You have a wonderful laugh.

734
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,304
It's like music in here.

735
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,550
Thank you, Norman.

736
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,781
Hair.

737
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,373
Come on.

738
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,478
Get back!
Get back!

739
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,608
Officer down!
Officer down!

740
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,614
You bastard!

741
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,654
Did you actually hear
what was said?

742
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,610
He said something
about the Kama Sutra.

743
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,894
She was laughing.

744
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,959
- Governor.
- Gate 11 opening.

745
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,466
Gate 3 opening.

746
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,542
I honestly find this insulting.

747
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,707
If you're to question
my motives at this stage,

748
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:58,909
before I've even started...

749
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,612
It is my job to ask questions,
Ms. Collins.

750
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,998
Now, I don't know
what the hell went on here.

751
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,184
Do you really think
I'd be stupid enough

752
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,987
to jeopardize my job?

753
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,595
The prisoner concerned
worked exceptionally hard,

754
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,257
was highly intelligent
and methodical.

755
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,927
The prisoner concerned,
Ms. Collins...

756
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,434
The prisoner concerned,
Ms. Collins,

757
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,740
cut the throat of an officer
at his previous prison.

758
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,975
At Barfield,
he has already held one hostage,

759
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,711
and he has just now broken
another one's nose.

760
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,584
Then who was it
gave that prisoner permission

761
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,987
to assist me in the library,
Ms. Hewitt?

762
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,288
Before you start making
any insinuations

763
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,023
or accusations concerning
my professional capabilities,

764
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,588
I would say someone else
should be severely reprimanded

765
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,295
for placing me at risk,
shouldn't they?

766
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,001
Governor Lyons said
he'd told you about Jones.

767
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,171
I told you.

768
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,306
He's a ruddy psychopath.

769
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:08,183
Russ, he was also
the only available volunteer.

770
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,689
And anyway, since he's been
on his medication, he's been...

771
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,321
Roddy!
Show yourself, son.

772
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,990
Roddy!

773
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,560
Oh, shit!

774
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,229
It's Morgan.
We need a medical team.

775
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,035
We've got
all this bloody equipment.

776
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,372
Why wasn't the library covered?

777
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,842
How the hell did it happen?

778
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,811
I wasn't told
the library was open.

779
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,211
It isn't, but that's no excuse.

780
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,443
Control.
We're moving the prisoner now.

781
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,589
He's a mutilator.

782
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,488
Something must have provoked
him.

783
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,891
He never does that on weekend.

784
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,595
I can't have missed it.
I've got the timetable here.

785
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,293
No.
It's been changed.

786
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,927
New timetable as from yesterday.

787
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,403
Â£27.50.

788
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,471
What?

789
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,168
Oh, I'd better go back
to the station.

790
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,985
- I haven't got that much money.
- Faster by train.

791
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,240
It'd take a good
four and a half hours by coach!

792
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,312
Due to a fault on the line.

793
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,909
We apologize for the delay.

794
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,287
- Good luck, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

795
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,732
I think the engine overheated.

796
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:35,330
I'm on the hard shoulder
just after Junction 16.

797
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,406
Oh, God.

798
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,466
There's a man
running towards me!

799
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:40,444
Help me, please!
He's coming towards me!

800
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,537
Get the police!

801
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,980
Please!
You've got help me!

802
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,052
I'm...

803
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,282
- Get away!
- I don't want to hurt you!

804
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,516
Go away!

805
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,621
Your self-mutilator. Classic.

806
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,293
Somehow managed to shove a razor
right up to here.

807
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,579
Previous doctor
must have stitched him up

808
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:06,764
and not noticed it,

809
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,171
so he had it in case
of emergency, so to speak.

810
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,800
And what do you want me to do?

811
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,846
Run every self-mutilator
through a metal detector?

812
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,711
Maybe get this one over
to a mental hospital?

813
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,377
Have you been over the block
to see Norman Jones yet?

814
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,579
- I've only just got here.
- He is on medication.

815
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,350
Yes, he is. Largactil.
Three tablets per day.

816
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:28,484
Governor, are these them?

817
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,525
Found them in Norman Jones'
mattress.

818
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,596
That's the good news.

819
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,596
The bad news...

820
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:40,070
It looks like Fisher's gone
on extended home leave.

821
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,537
No! Get away!

822
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,804
I need to get to the prison!
I'm from the prison!

823
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,776
Help me!

824
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,278
Oh.

825
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,074
Oh.

826
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,583
You, sir.
Stand away from that car.

827
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,586
He's an escaped prisoner!

828
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,747
I haven't escaped!

829
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,757
I'm trying to get back!

830
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:05,158
The 19th of May 1986,
Alan John Fisher admitted

831
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,974
that he had been under
the influence of alcohol

832
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:10,833
but denied playing any part
in the brutal murder of his son.

833
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,397
Tony John Fisher died

834
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,703
from the multiple injuries
inflicted by his father.

835
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,608
Alan John Fisher was found
guilty of the manslaughter

836
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:21,942
of his 18-month-old son.

837
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,820
I don't know how to thank
you fellas, but I owe you!

838
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,256
God bless you!

839
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:42,533
Prisoner Alan Fisher
returning back at...

840
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,592
One minute past bleeding 10:00,
Fisher.

841
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:46,661
That's what I call
cutting it fine.

842
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,102
Thank you very much indeed,
Mrs. Fisher.

843
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,873
It's all right.
Fisher's back.

844
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,805
No, it's not all right.

845
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,076
Take him down the block.

846
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,618
Oh, come on.
He was only one minute late.

847
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:03,348
If he had killed
his entire family,

848
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,432
who do you think would be held
responsible for that?

849
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:06,456
Fisher?

850
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,152
He's a liar.

851
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:14,358
So she told you, did she,
June, my wife?

852
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:19,670
Well... let me tell you
something.

853
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,107
If I had told you
about the divorce...

854
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,801
told you that she only wanted me

855
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,608
to sign over the house to her...

856
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:33,209
that she'd been claiming
Social Security payments

857
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,846
all these years,
I'd have never got out.

858
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:41,188
You know as well as I do
how much importance they put

859
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,783
on having a secure family.

860
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,698
I served my time.

861
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,997
And I did the hard way
because I wanted to.

862
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,673
You think you understand.

863
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,643
It was me.

864
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,216
Me... that made June not bring
my daughters to visit.

865
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,248
Me.

866
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,360
I battered my own little boy
to death.

867
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,465
Me.

868
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,975
I broke his skull and his arms.

869
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,614
Twisted his legs.

870
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,321
To this day,
I don't know why I did it.

871
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,419
Being drunk was no excuse.

872
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,323
I never thought
I'd ever be released...

873
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,334
I didn't even think
I had the right to hope.

874
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,537
Truth is, miss...

875
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,383
I killed my son.

876
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,155
Mr. Fisher, you will lose
all of your privileges,

877
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,805
and you will be held
in the punishment cells.

878
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,229
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Take him down.

879
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,959
Yes, ma'am.

880
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:29,295
Come on.

881
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,801
Hey, Fisher!

882
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,963
Fisher!

883
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,665
Did you have a good time, mate?

884
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,833
Fisher, can you hear me?!

885
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,685
Can't believe they brought you
back in a police car.

886
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,643
One minute after closing time!

887
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,012
My daughters gave me
a big party.

888
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,333
- That's great.
- Nice one, Fisher!

889
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,656
With a cake!

890
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,854
Wife had a banner out!

891
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:33,363
Lovely!

892
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,956
"Welcome home, Dad!"

892
00:50:36,305 --> 00:51:36,744
