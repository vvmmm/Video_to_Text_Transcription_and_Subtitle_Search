2
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,561
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:46,703
...you are about to witness
the most spectacular feat...

4
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,569
...ever attempted by the greatest daredevil
in the world.

5
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,942
The Great Leslie.

6
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,024
He will be strapped in a straitjacket
before your very eyes...

7
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,494
...and lifted up into the clouds...

8
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,905
...where eagles soar and
no sparrow dares to venture.

9
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,716
Hey, bull's-eye.

10
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,651
There's a hole in the balloon.

11
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,354
- He'll never make it.
- He'll never make it.

12
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,783
- A parachute.
- A parachute.

13
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02,662
A parachute!

14
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,892
A parachute!

15
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,133
What?

16
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:21,218
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to witness a feat...

17
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,585
...so dangerous that only one man
would dare attempt it.

18
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,822
The Magnificent Professor Fate.

19
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,241
Attach the hooks.

20
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,247
The professor will defy death
as his assistant...

21
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:49,182
...swoops down from the sky,
snares the professor...

22
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:53,451
...on the ground and lifts him into the air.

23
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,326
Contact.

24
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:01,025
Switch on.

25
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,410
Up, Max! Bring it up!

26
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,178
Coming up.

27
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:23,390
Max, up, you idiot! Up!

28
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:25,794
She's up!

29
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,529
Up, you idiot, up!

30
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,205
Too much weight.

31
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,970
I'd like to see The Great Leslie try that one.

32
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,561
After today you will have broken
every existing speed record.

33
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,360
What are your future plans?

34
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:30,767
That depends on my success today.
Gentlemen, will you excuse me please?

35
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:44,417
Be careful, you idiot,
you'll blow us both to kingdom come.

36
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,936
He's getting in the boat.

37
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:31,366
- You sure you tested the mechanism?
- It can't miss.

38
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,901
All you have to do is throw this switch,
it homes in on the loudest engine noise.

39
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,775
You see, it's picked up Leslie's boat!

40
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:43,879
Farewell, Leslie.

41
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,080
Away.

42
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:56,604
Golly!

43
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,501
Look at the pretty face on that...

44
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,235
Get away from there.

45
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:18,460
I intend to cover the measured mile
in approximately twelve seconds.

46
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:35,048
Activate the rockets.

47
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,905
One hundred and fifty!

48
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,109
Two hundred and fifty!

49
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:09,620
- I'll go down in history!
- Three hundred.

50
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,086
They'll erect a monument to me!

51
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,261
I've done it!

52
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,894
- Professor? Professor?
- What?

53
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:19,157
Well, there's another one Leslie
can try on for size.

54
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:23,403
Gentlemen.

55
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:28,100
I've requested this meeting in order
to make you a proposition.

56
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:33,748
In my opinion your company manufactures
the finest automobile in the world.

57
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,024
The automobile represents progress,
in the most profound sense of the word.

58
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:44,120
The ultimate example
of American ingenuity and enterprise.

59
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:50,201
This great nation cannot take a back seat
to competitors like Daimler...

60
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:54,569
...Mercedes, Napier, Rolls-Royce,
Dietrich or Panhard.

61
00:18:55,176 --> 00:19:00,410
Gentlemen, I propose to prove
that the American automobile...

62
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:04,719
...your automobile, is without peers.

63
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:09,888
And just how do you propose
to prove that, sir?

64
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:11,926
A race.

65
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:15,325
Really, sir, you surprise me.

66
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:19,398
Automobile races
are becoming most commonplace.

67
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:23,433
I mean, a long race. A very long race.

68
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,242
Buffalo to Albany? It's been done.

69
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,911
Chicago to Cleveland? That's been done.

70
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:32,778
New York...

71
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:40,687
...to Paris?

72
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:47,468
You must build an automobile
to the most precise specifications.

73
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,336
Absolutely no!

74
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,374
For a company of this repute,
a great company the likes of this one...

75
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:02,446
...entrusting its entire automobile future
to a man like Leslie, it's disreputable.

76
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:07,322
A cheap carnival performer,
a fraud, a trickster.

77
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:13,196
Help! Don't! A madman!

78
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,496
I apologize.
I thought you were someone else.

79
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:17,696
Pulling it out by the roots. I warned you.

80
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:21,868
The madman. Did you see him trying
to pull my beard out by the roots?

81
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,812
Leslie will lose!
Your automobile will lose! I will win!

82
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:36,890
He jumped!

83
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:42,659
I shall build the greatest automobile
in the world and I shall win!

84
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,366
Okay, Professor.

85
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:51,005
This time it will not be Leslie.
It will be I, Professor Fate!

86
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,742
Fate the Magnificent!

87
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:10,695
And it is with no little pride
that the Webber Motor Car Company...

88
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:14,765
...unveils its latest
and greatest achievement.

89
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:18,835
Gentlemen, behold the motor car
of the future!

90
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,141
Holy cow!

91
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:35,792
Holy Toledo, look at that car!

92
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:38,455
Yes, it's quite a car.

93
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:55,182
- I never saw a car like that in my life.
- You never will again either.

94
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:57,186
Give me the bomb.

95
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,326
Professor, be careful.

96
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:06,489
After you activate the mechanism,
you only got ten seconds.

97
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:09,363
I know that. Give me the cord.

98
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,748
We have taken the liberty of naming it
after the man who inspired its creation.

99
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:30,214
- The Leslie Special.
- I'm deeply honored.

100
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:29,750
What took you so long?

101
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:34,162
I had to go to the Rolls-Royce agency.
I had to steal a spare magneto.

102
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,498
It's ready.

103
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,262
Yes, it's ready.

104
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,579
There has never been anything like this.

105
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,773
- Professor, your greatest creation.
- The work of genius.

106
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:53,946
The finest parts from the greatest
automobiles in the world.

107
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:55,717
The Hannibal Twin 8.

108
00:24:56,358 --> 00:25:00,557
When the blizzards and snow storms come,
we will continue on just as planned.

109
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,654
Push the button, Max.

110
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:11,339
When the rains come,
and when the snow melts...

111
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:14,674
...we shall continue to rise above it.

112
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,680
Push the button, Max!

113
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,692
Nature will chase us, we will beat her.

114
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,765
And brigands, thieves, cutthroats
of all nations may hound us.

115
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:37,668
But we are ready for them.
We will blast them to kingdom come!

116
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:42,904
We can melt, we can blast.
We can rise above! We are invincible!

117
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:44,736
Take us down.

118
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:47,143
Push the button, Max.

119
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:01,387
Yes.

120
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,200
- Mr. Goodbody.
- What is it, Frisbee?

121
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:11,573
- You have to come.
- What's the matter?

122
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,545
Well, it's a young lady, sir.

123
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:17,012
- What about the young lady?
- She's handcuffed herself to the door.

124
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,247
- Handcuffed herself to the door?
- Of the men's room.

125
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:22,883
What?

126
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:33,828
Gentleman!

127
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:37,236
Return to your assignments.
This is a newspaper office.

128
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,936
There will be no lollygagging
in this hallway.

129
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,805
There will be no lollygagging
in this hallway.

130
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,745
Now, young lady, who are you?

131
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,785
I am a female past the age of consent.

132
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:50,617
I'm the first woman to edit
the newspaper at my college.

133
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:55,923
I'll remain handcuffed until I'm the first
female reporter of The New York Sentinel.

134
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:59,021
Over my dead body.
Unlock those handcuffs and get out.

135
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:01,761
I will unlock the handcuffs
when you give me the job.

136
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:02,563
Never!

137
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,028
- Never?
- Never.

138
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:09,436
But, sir, if she remains here,
handcuffed to the men's room.

139
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:14,476
You men may use the washroom
on the next floor.

140
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:19,050
- They can't keep running upstairs forever.
- They can until you get hungry.

141
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:21,921
That would make a story
for your competition.

142
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:25,587
Woman starves to death in the men's room
of The New York Sentinel.

143
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,427
- You wouldn't dare.
- I would dare anything for women's rights.

144
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:39,274
- Give me an assignment. If I fail, fire me.
- You're fired.

145
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:43,277
Frisbee, post a bulletin.
Suffragettes are not permitted.

146
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,078
- Let me cover the great race.
- It's covered by experienced reporters.

147
00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:50,419
No, I mean really cover it.
From start to finish, mile by mile.

148
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:54,758
Reporters are not permitted on the trip,
only contestants. Those are the rules.

149
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:57,696
We run a newspaper,
not a school for revolutionaries!

150
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:59,860
Enter the race. Enter your own car.

151
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:03,831
We are running a newspaper, a newspaper,
not an automotive agency!

152
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,377
Are you afraid of losing?
Give me the money and I'll enter the race.

153
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,708
I despise suffragettes.

154
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,948
I am not just trying to get
the vote for women.

155
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:17,351
I'll emancipate them from
the drudgery of being servants or saints.

156
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,083
Out of the laundry rooms
and off the pedestals!

157
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,853
You're mad, young woman, you're mad!

158
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:28,594
And you, sir, are a slave
to your puritanism.

159
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:32,029
Does your wife wear silk stockings?

160
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:36,133
- I won't discuss such an intimate subject.
- She does, and they're very expensive.

161
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,077
But has she raised her skirts
for you and shown her calf?

162
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:42,480
A woman's leg in a silk stocking
can be quite alluring.

163
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:44,749
Maggie Dubois.

164
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,654
You've never seen
a woman's leg in a silk stocking.

165
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,885
Never, never in your whole life.

166
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:53,956
Frisbee, leave the room!

167
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,160
What are you thinking?

168
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,276
There isn't anything men and women
can't discuss when civilized and mature.

169
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,708
And emancipated.

170
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:10,912
- Anything.
- You can't discuss it. That's the problem.

171
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,112
Women have to emancipate themselves
in order to emancipate men.

172
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:17,088
So they can emancipate each other
where it counts the most.

173
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:19,921
Fifty dollars for every exclusive story
I send back...

174
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:22,622
...and a hundred dollars
for every photograph.

175
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:29,528
You're a fine man.
A timid man, but a worthwhile one.

176
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,870
Have a cigar.

177
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:34,909
Don't smoke?

178
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:53,596
The Sentinel will scoop the world!

179
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:34,906
Man the helm!

180
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,012
Aye, aye, sir.

181
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,012
- Up periscope!
- Up periscope!

182
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:25,097
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

183
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:29,336
I don't know what she's doing here, boss.
She says she's a woman with a mission.

184
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,742
But I think she's a spy for Professor Fate.

185
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:37,978
You're not suggesting I'm the first woman
to ever seek an audience with Great Leslie.

186
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,387
I'm simply Leslie and I'm at your service.

187
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:46,057
I'm rather thirsty.
Do you have something cold?

188
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,692
I have champagne.

189
00:31:57,475 --> 00:32:00,137
- Down periscope.
- Aye, aye, sir.

190
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:07,442
Up, idiot! Up, up!

191
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,489
I got you.

192
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:23,999
There's something wrong
with the mechanism.

193
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:27,438
Down, you idiot!

194
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:30,502
Release your feet. Release your feet!

195
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:35,144
- You have to be careful...
- You've got a brain the size of a carbuncle.

196
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,843
Get out of here before Leslie spots us!

197
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,849
Dive, crash dive!

198
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,122
Help!

199
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,732
Wait. Professor!

200
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:27,444
I'm a reporter.

201
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:31,149
A reporter?

202
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:34,084
You disapprove?

203
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:38,848
No. Let's say I'm a bit surprised.

204
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:41,354
Let's be honest and say you disapprove.

205
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,423
A woman doing a man's job is competitive,
both sexually and economically.

206
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:51,167
You want to know why I'm here.
I want to report the race and be in it.

207
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,169
It's as simple as that.

208
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:59,605
Well, it's hardly that simple. But...

209
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,584
...let's discuss it, shall we?

210
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:08,048
Let's discuss the whole thing completely.
Right from the beginning.

211
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:12,791
Do you want a wife, a companion?
Or just a woman?

212
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:16,595
There are certain things
we shouldn't discuss.

213
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:20,470
Why? Men discuss their relationships
with women.

214
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:22,639
Gentlemen don't.

215
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:27,779
But I'm not a gentleman. I'm a woman.

216
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:31,517
Indeed you are.

217
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,389
Then say it. What's expected of me?

218
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:37,785
I'm an emancipated woman
and you're an emancipated man.

219
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:42,392
There are things that should remain
implicit between men and women.

220
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,095
Why?

221
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:49,665
It's been this way for years
and I see no reason to change.

222
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,540
- I am a creature of habit.
- All the more reason.

223
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:57,547
Now you're using
your female attractiveness as a weapon.

224
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:03,149
Equality, real equality
of the sexes bothers you, doesn't it.

225
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:09,123
I can speak, read and write Russian,
French and Arabic.

226
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,290
Yes, so can I. Plus five other languages.

227
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:14,301
- I can drive any car there is.
- So can Hezekiah.

228
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:18,237
I won the
Woman's International Competition.

229
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:23,242
En garde.

230
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,072
Very well.

231
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:00,988
Now if you'd won the
Men's International Fencing Competition...

232
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:09,087
Now, we'll talk this out.

233
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:25,110
Now if you'll excuse me.

234
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,085
Hezekiah, see Miss Dubois
to her horse please.

235
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,822
You're afraid!
You're afraid of a real woman!

236
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:41,258
I'll show you! I'll enter the race myself.
I'll enter my own car and I'll beat you!

237
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,297
And another thing...

238
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,453
Professor, dinner is served.

239
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:03,919
Who is it?

240
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:08,762
I wish to see Professor Fate.
I'm a reporter. For The Sentinel.

241
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,904
Beat it, little girl,
or I'll sic the dogs on you.

242
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,183
Who was that?

243
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:28,950
- Kids, just kids, more kids.
- Stupid kids.

244
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,522
You want me to feed you?

245
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,309
Listen to that!

246
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:31,086
Out back by the garage.
The car! Hurry up!

247
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:48,344
Help!

248
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,678
Help!

249
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:58,056
- You sure you locked the door?
- I'm positive. Professor, be careful.

250
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:01,496
If you open the door one inch,
it sets off the alarm.

251
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,430
Help!

252
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,623
Get away! Get away!

253
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:36,999
Help! Get me down!

254
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:39,898
Go away.

255
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,676
You idiot.

256
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,108
Get me down! Help!

257
00:41:49,254 --> 00:41:51,415
Get me down! Please!

258
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:01,327
Out! And stay out!

259
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,329
You can't treat me that way!
I'll expose you!

260
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:10,242
Out! And stay out! A pox on you!

261
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:13,074
I don't care. You beast of a turncoat!

262
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,514
What are you kicking the professor for?

263
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,412
Put up your dukes! Come on!

264
00:42:21,257 --> 00:42:22,884
You're a lunatic! A lunatic!

265
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,156
You can't talk to me that way!
I'm a member of the press.

266
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:44,072
Get off the car, please.
Will you just get off the car?

267
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:51,147
Hands off the car. Get away from there.

268
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:57,025
Keep your hands away from there.
Get off of the car! Get away from the car.

269
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,164
- Get away from there!
- Hold it.

270
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:03,434
That's it.

271
00:43:18,956 --> 00:43:20,618
Away from the car!

272
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:39,810
Hold it.

273
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,178
That's it.

274
00:43:54,564 --> 00:43:57,124
- Everything is ready?
- Everything is ready.

275
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:08,639
Hold it.

276
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:13,148
Just stay away from the automobile.
I'll sign it for you.

277
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:16,048
I checked everything over twice.
We're ready to go.

278
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:19,558
Look, buddy, will you please step
to one side like a good boy?

279
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:44,746
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm an official entry.

280
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,883
- Representing The Sentinel.
- What?

281
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,960
Since it is my job as a reporter to be there
when the first car crosses the finish line...

282
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:55,761
...it will be necessary for me to win.

283
00:45:01,842 --> 00:45:04,174
Imagine that crazy female!

284
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:07,379
She won't even get as far as Albany
in that Steamer.

285
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:11,643
Don't bet on it.
That's a very determined young lady.

286
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:13,684
Good morning, Hester.

287
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,121
Have a cigar?

288
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:19,525
I want to thank you again
for this opportunity, Mr. Goodbody.

289
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,531
I had little choice
after your conversation with my wife.

290
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,227
Henry, if you can't be more gracious,
shut up!

291
00:45:25,468 --> 00:45:28,996
- It's a great day for the cause, Maggie.
- It is indeed, Hester.

292
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,337
Drivers, to your cars!

293
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:47,990
- Hezekiah.
- Boss.

294
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,024
All right, Max.

295
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,258
- Good luck, Maggie.
- Thank you.

296
00:45:57,806 --> 00:45:59,171
Max!

297
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,880
- Come on, Max!
- All checked.

298
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,818
Are you sure you took care of everything?

299
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,461
Just keep your eye on car number 2.

300
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:13,587
Now, at approximately the 50 mile mark,
car number 3, it loses its transmission.

301
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,106
And in about five seconds,
car number 4 bites the dust.

302
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:42,189
Genius, Max, positive genius.
What's next?

303
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:46,658
- Car number 5, the engine falls out.
- Car number five?

304
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,032
Max! We're number 5.

305
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,392
That shouldn't happen to number 6.
I fixed it so the wheels would come off.

306
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:26,103
Smoke! Get the fire extinguisher!

307
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:30,175
- I got the extinguisher!
- Get the extinguisher!

308
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,718
Coming through. I got it.

309
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:39,455
I think we got it in time. I think we got it!

310
00:49:41,462 --> 00:49:43,954
I think we got it now, Professor.

311
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:46,123
Okay, she's out.

312
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,370
Where are you?

313
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:54,805
- Where are you?
- To your right.

314
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:19,263
Hold it.

315
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,543
That was a pigeon.

316
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,651
- Get the bird.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:36,750
- Come here, bird, just come here.
- All right. Hurry up, will you, Frisbee?

318
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,893
Frisbee, just get the bird.

319
00:51:44,136 --> 00:51:46,662
Don't lollygag out there, just get the bird.

320
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:48,870
I got him. I got him, sir.

321
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,206
- Frisbee.
- Yes, I got the bird.

322
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:57,509
Just hold it. Frisbee. Just be quiet.

323
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:02,416
Yes, sir. Oh, help me, sir.
Oh, please try to save me, sir.

324
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:06,660
Just be steady, Frisbee.
Just be steady. Be quiet now.

325
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:11,464
And it's organizations like The Sentinel
that we must deal with first.

326
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:14,868
Why, at this very moment
the editor sits behind his desk...

327
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:24,408
Frisbee, next time be more careful.
If you're falling, let go of the bird.

328
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,664
"Sentinel car takes lead approximately
600 miles west of Chicago."

329
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:45,195
Frisbee!

330
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:56,712
Well, that should put us about here.

331
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:20,877
Farewell.

332
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,944
Hezekiah, see what's wrong with her car.

333
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:08,358
- I must have fainted.
- Perfectly natural in this heat.

334
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:11,433
- Thank you for stopping.
- My pleasure.

335
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:13,464
May I offer you some water?

336
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,135
No, I'm much better now. Thank you.

337
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:19,577
- Hezekiah, can she be fixed?
- Not a chance, boss.

338
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,283
Well, I guess that's the end of that.

339
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:28,055
I know how disappointed you must be.

340
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,749
But it's amazing that you were able
to accomplish what you did.

341
00:54:31,862 --> 00:54:34,127
You mean amazing because I'm a woman.

342
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:37,265
The Steamer is a fast, sporty,
attractive automobile...

343
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:39,804
...designed for city driving
and country picnics.

344
00:54:39,872 --> 00:54:41,863
You're lucky it didn't blow up on you.

345
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,605
You know, it's really amazing that anyone
was able to go this far. I congratulate you.

346
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:49,313
Not as a woman, but an intrepid autoist.

347
00:54:50,216 --> 00:54:52,708
You mean an intrepid woman autoist.

348
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:57,085
A rather dubious honor when you consider
that the accomplishment is predicated...

349
00:54:57,158 --> 00:55:00,026
...on the fact that you chose
the wrong automobile.

350
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:05,098
But the choice was not mine.
My editor, a man, made the arrangements.

351
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:08,194
Your editor is something less
than an authority on automobiles.

352
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,936
But you, on the other hand, claim full
knowledge of the auto and its workings.

353
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:19,509
So, being a woman, you chose to ignore
the practical evidence, acted emotionally...

354
00:55:19,918 --> 00:55:23,445
...entered the race knowing full well
that you couldn't possibly finish.

355
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:24,852
Oh, I'll finish.

356
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:27,389
May I ask how?

357
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:31,962
No, you may not ask how, but I'll finish.
I may not still be an official entry...

358
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:34,532
...but I will report every foot of this race.

359
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,728
- I'll get another car.
- From where?

360
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:42,137
If I don't, I'll get something else.
I'll find a way, even if I have to walk.

361
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:45,211
What are you waiting for?

362
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:48,340
Every minute wasted
is another mile for Professor Fate.

363
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:55,255
We'll take you as far as Boracho,
where I pick up some gasoline.

364
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:58,089
- Perfect.
- From there, you're on your own!

365
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:00,530
Thank you. My luggage, please.

366
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,289
Hezekiah, the young lady's luggage please.

367
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,817
Indian attack! We're being attacked!

368
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:58,761
Smoke screen, Max!
Give them the smoke screen!

369
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,167
No, you idiot! The smoke screen!
Push the button, Max!

370
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:08,705
Smoke screen!

371
00:57:46,518 --> 00:57:49,010
Get it down! Get it down!

372
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:54,020
Take cover, you fools, take cover!

373
00:57:54,094 --> 00:57:56,086
Indians! Savages!

374
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,865
Indian attack!
Get a posse! Savages behind us!

375
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,531
- Help!
- Savages attacking us! Indians!

376
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,633
Take cover!

377
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,109
Welcome to Boracho.

378
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:11,942
Yes, thank you.
Indians, savages attacking us!

379
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:15,514
- Right behind us. An attack!
- What's funny?

380
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:20,289
That was just the sheriff and some
of the men dressed up like Indians.

381
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:24,692
- Why, they rode out to welcome you.
- That's very reassuring, Mr. Mayor.

382
00:58:24,763 --> 00:58:28,530
Now if you will just show us where
the gasoline is, we'll be on our way.

383
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:30,432
You understand every second counts.

384
00:58:30,503 --> 00:58:34,200
- You can't go now.
- What do you mean we can't go now?

385
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:36,542
You're the guest of honor.

386
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,078
Well, I don't want to be a guest of honor.

387
00:58:39,146 --> 00:58:41,672
I got to present you
with this here key to the city!

388
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:43,546
He doesn't want a key, he wants gas!

389
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:47,315
- As Mayor of Boracho, l...
- I want gas and I want it now!

390
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:50,552
- You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow!
- Tomorrow.

391
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:52,987
You're gonna accept this here key.

392
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:55,791
You're gonna attend that meeting tonight...

393
00:58:55,865 --> 00:59:00,734
...or, by jumped-up Harry, you're gonna be
guest of honor at a necktie party!

394
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,568
Necktie?
Well, what kind of cheap present is that?

395
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,610
Listen to me, you cheap,
mealy-mouthed, third-rate war healer!

396
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,738
- Somebody get me a rope.
- You want a rope?

397
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,510
I got a rope in the car.

398
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,911
Somebody get me a rope!
Hurry up, they're leaving.

399
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:19,821
Oh! Get me a rope, somebody!
Get me a rope!

400
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,604
- You gonna give us any trouble?
- I beg your pardon.

401
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:37,510
We been planning this here shindig
for over a week.

402
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:41,516
Now do we string up the bunch of you or
cooperate and be the guest of honor.

403
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:46,989
I greet you with cordiality and good cheer.
It's a pleasure to be the great honor.

404
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:51,091
It's a big celebration tonight.
You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow.

405
00:59:51,162 --> 00:59:56,658
We look forward to celebrating
and the hospitality of your community.

406
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:01,969
Quiet! Citizens of Boracho! Quiet!

407
01:01:02,143 --> 01:01:04,510
Citizens of Boracho. Thank you.

408
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:08,346
As Mayor of Boracho, I offer a toast...

409
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:12,081
...to our guest of honor, The Great Leslie!

410
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:21,159
To the fair city of Boracho.

411
01:01:28,573 --> 01:01:30,064
Now here she is...

412
01:01:30,443 --> 01:01:34,937
...the Queen of the West,
Boracho's own Lily Olay!

413
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,575
- I spotted the gas!
- Shut up.

414
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:36,621
Howdy, Mayor. Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, there, Curly.

415
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,287
Hello, there.

416
01:05:39,362 --> 01:05:42,388
Lily, this here's our guest of honor,
The Great Leslie.

417
01:05:42,465 --> 01:05:43,955
It's a pleasure to meet you.

418
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:46,298
Welcome to Boracho, honey.

419
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:51,673
Won't you join us?

420
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:55,144
Just for a minute. Scoot over.
How long are y'all going to be here?

421
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:58,706
Unfortunately, just for the night.
We have to leave in the morning.

422
01:05:58,784 --> 01:05:59,773
That's a pity.

423
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:02,714
I would like to propose a toast
to Miss Olay.

424
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:11,725
It's lucky Texas Jack ain't around.
He'd gun that dude for sure.

425
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:22,871
Pardon me, Mr. Partner.
Who is this Texas Jack?

426
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:25,374
Who's Texas Jack?

427
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,179
The roughest, toughest gunslinger
in these parts.

428
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,754
Lily is his girl.

429
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:37,455
- Lily's his girl.
- Terrific!

430
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:50,940
Honey, your smile is downright painful!

431
01:06:51,043 --> 01:06:53,604
Thank you. Are you a native of Boracho?

432
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:56,413
I ain't no native, I was born here!

433
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,986
- Mr. Partner.
- Yes.

434
01:07:00,054 --> 01:07:02,488
Where would I find this Texas Jack?

435
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:05,523
He's got a ranch
about eight miles south of town.

436
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:14,593
I have to get on that moon again.
Don't go away, you hear?

437
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:18,107
- It's been a pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome to Boracho, honey.

438
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,780
Jack.

439
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:50,434
Now wait a minute, Jack.
This is a friendly celebration.

440
01:07:50,812 --> 01:07:54,874
Fiddle-de-dee! I don't much like
the way you're celebrating.

441
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,484
So you just step back, Sheriff,
unless you want to fall back.

442
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:01,517
Howdy, Jack, honey.

443
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:15,863
Jack, honey, don't get rough.
He's the guest of honor.

444
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:23,881
Now just a moment.

445
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:34,155
I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
As you can see, I am unarmed.

446
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:36,227
He's unarmed.

447
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:46,070
- Let's get the gas.
- Not yet.

448
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:50,807
All right now, everybody stand back
and give a man some fighting room.

449
01:08:59,692 --> 01:09:02,092
Now will you give me some fighting room?

450
01:09:08,935 --> 01:09:10,266
My camera!

451
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:33,558
Citizens of Boracho, stop!

452
01:09:33,864 --> 01:09:36,594
Music, somebody! Start the music!

453
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,229
Citizens of Boracho!

454
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:22,514
Now will you give me some fighting room?

455
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:24,314
Jack, honey!

456
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:35,867
Excuse me, please.

457
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:59,359
- Now look what you've done.
- Me?

458
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:31,428
There's the gas.

459
01:11:31,532 --> 01:11:34,900
There's a fight! Fight in the saloon! Fight!

460
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,768
Fight in the saloon! Big fight! Fight!

461
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,638
Fight! There's a big fight
in the saloon. Texas Jack! He's drunk!

462
01:11:52,356 --> 01:11:54,689
Max! Max, you idiot, the gas.

463
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:02,298
Where's the car?

464
01:12:03,769 --> 01:12:05,100
Get the car!

465
01:12:32,402 --> 01:12:34,233
Hey, boss!

466
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:41,171
Now can I have me some fighting room?

467
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:51,756
The back is full. I'll put the rest
of the gas in the seat.

468
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:54,088
Leave it? Can't leave it for Leslie.

469
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:57,496
Leave Leslie to me. Start the car. The car.

470
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,132
Switch on!

471
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,206
My apologies.

472
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,151
The gasoline!

473
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,524
We shall win!

474
01:14:41,016 --> 01:14:42,507
Well, that finishes Leslie.

475
01:14:42,585 --> 01:14:45,076
Oh, no, not Leslie. Never Leslie.

476
01:14:45,321 --> 01:14:50,055
The Great Leslie. He'll think of something,
but we'll be in Alaska by the time he does.

477
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,964
I'm offering you a lift.

478
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:38,005
Or would you prefer
an engraved invitation?

479
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:44,746
- I might consider an apology.
- An apology?

480
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,922
For what?
It's twenty miles back to Boracho.

481
01:15:47,993 --> 01:15:50,690
- You'd never make it.
- Well, that's your fault.

482
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:52,019
My fault.

483
01:15:52,232 --> 01:15:55,133
I warned you.
I would not be left behind in Boracho.

484
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:58,103
You left me no choice
so I had to stow away in Fate's car.

485
01:15:58,172 --> 01:15:59,901
And he cast you adrift.

486
01:16:00,407 --> 01:16:03,241
If you had provided me
with transportation to Grommett...

487
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:06,542
...where I could have caught a train,
it never would have happened.

488
01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:09,345
Grommett was 100 miles out of our way.

489
01:16:10,152 --> 01:16:12,313
And where are you going now?

490
01:16:13,022 --> 01:16:17,687
Professor Fate destroyed all the gasoline,
Grommett is a matter of necessity.

491
01:16:18,529 --> 01:16:21,396
And when you reach Grommett
you'll send for gasoline?

492
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:25,835
But if you were to send for gasoline now
it would be in Grommett when you arrived.

493
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,269
If I were to send for gasoline now
I would need a telegraph.

494
01:16:30,676 --> 01:16:32,166
Not necessarily.

495
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:44,958
I will take you no further than Grommett.

496
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,512
Hey, Professor, where we going?

497
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:15,683
We save 15 miles by following
the tracks, Max.

498
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:17,990
Oh, terrific!

499
01:17:59,378 --> 01:18:01,369
- Is that gasoline?
- Sure is.

500
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,145
Let me give you a hand with it.

501
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:05,912
Wait a minute.

502
01:18:06,219 --> 01:18:09,484
- Nobody gets nothing till it's signed for.
- Of course.

503
01:18:09,722 --> 01:18:12,453
- You M. Dubois?
- I beg your pardon.

504
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,895
- Gasoline consigned to M. Dubois.
- What?

505
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:18,156
- Oh, I'm M. Dubois.
- I knew it.

506
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:19,723
You got some identification?

507
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:22,497
What did I tell you?
I told you not to trust her.

508
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:24,370
My press card.

509
01:18:25,841 --> 01:18:27,832
Okay, just sign on the line.

510
01:18:29,378 --> 01:18:31,506
- What if I don't sign?
- You see.

511
01:18:31,982 --> 01:18:34,815
Look, ma'am, you don't sign,
you don't get no gas.

512
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:38,916
Well, Mr. Leslie?
You wish to continue the race, so do I.

513
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:41,052
As far as the West Coast?

514
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:43,783
If she goes, I stay!

515
01:18:44,797 --> 01:18:45,957
Hezekiah.

516
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:48,591
You going to sign or do I send
the gas back to New York?

517
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:50,134
Miss Dubois, this is very...

518
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:52,694
The gas is yours if you take me
to the West Coast.

519
01:18:52,772 --> 01:18:55,332
Under the circumstances,
it's a fair exchange.

520
01:18:55,408 --> 01:18:57,535
Load the gas back on the train.

521
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:00,580
She's not signing and
the train's leaving in five minutes.

522
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:04,710
Just one moment, please, sir.
I will not leave without Hezekiah.

523
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,682
If I can change his mind?

524
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:16,387
Suppose you don't change his mind?

525
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,869
Then I shall take this train back
to New York.

526
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:25,370
Sir, let me give you a hand
with the gasoline.

527
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,570
Boys, would you care to join me?

528
01:19:31,082 --> 01:19:35,747
Hezekiah, I understand how you feel,
but I beg you to reconsider.

529
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,456
A deal is a deal.

530
01:19:44,397 --> 01:19:48,061
Then I guess I'll have to hurry
or I'll miss my train. Goodbye, Hezekiah.

531
01:19:48,503 --> 01:19:49,731
You mean...

532
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:53,473
Well, a deal is a deal.
It's been wonderful knowing you.

533
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:55,574
What about the gas?

534
01:19:55,944 --> 01:19:57,070
I signed for it.

535
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:03,385
I'm sorry. You see,
this race ain't the right place for a woman.

536
01:20:04,654 --> 01:20:05,679
I understand.

537
01:20:05,856 --> 01:20:07,050
Board!

538
01:20:07,658 --> 01:20:08,647
Well.

539
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:13,454
- Would you take me to the train?
- Well, yes, ma'am.

540
01:20:19,772 --> 01:20:22,263
Boys and girls,
this is a six-cylinder automobile...

541
01:20:22,341 --> 01:20:24,707
...with an overhead cam that can...

542
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:28,279
It was built by a company
especially for me, for this race.

543
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:50,569
He just wouldn't listen.

544
01:20:51,474 --> 01:20:54,205
I told him, and he said that...

545
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:59,744
...he's had enough and he didn't think
you could win anyway.

546
01:20:59,952 --> 01:21:00,941
And...

547
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:05,150
...he said he was going to go back
to New York.

548
01:21:06,926 --> 01:21:08,553
Double-crossing females!

549
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:12,065
Hey, boss! Look.

550
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,331
Hey, conductor!

551
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:19,001
You are trying my patience, madam.

552
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,772
We know our rights.

553
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:23,903
You're obstructing traffic
and disturbing the peace!

554
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,073
- And you are exceeding your authority.
- I ain't exceeding nothing, lady!

555
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,014
- Then, arrest us.
- What?

556
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,720
Arrest us. I dare you.

557
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:41,997
Sorry, sir.

558
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,033
I want you to run to City Hall
and bail out Mrs. Goodbody.

559
01:21:45,103 --> 01:21:46,002
Yes, sir.

560
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:47,637
In about two hours.

561
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:48,870
Yes, sir.

562
01:22:16,673 --> 01:22:19,234
I once went
on an anthropological expedition...

563
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:21,708
...to study the Kwakiutl Indians.

564
01:22:22,579 --> 01:22:26,038
In winter, one Kwakiutl in a blanket froze.

565
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:30,152
But two Kwakiutls in the same blanket...

566
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:33,590
Yes?

567
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:34,992
Were warmer.

568
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:44,327
Would you hold this, please?

569
01:22:44,604 --> 01:22:45,593
Champagne?

570
01:22:46,674 --> 01:22:49,165
You put alcohol in the radiator
of the automobile...

571
01:22:49,277 --> 01:22:51,438
...to keep it from freezing, don't you?

572
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:06,553
I can't see a thing.

573
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:09,164
Neither can I.

574
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:12,934
Maybe we better stop.

575
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,412
I can't stand it, I'm freezing to death.

576
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:24,805
Shut up!

577
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:28,149
Even the thermometer is frozen.

578
01:23:29,423 --> 01:23:31,015
Everything's frozen.

579
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:37,891
Look at that!

580
01:23:53,985 --> 01:23:57,148
It won't take long to grow back.
It's only a half of a mustache.

581
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:18,604
What was that?

582
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:20,403
I don't know.

583
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:22,382
Well, I'll go see.

584
01:24:35,732 --> 01:24:37,825
Miss Dubois, please. Thank you.

585
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:21,143
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were Maximillian.

586
01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:26,113
Nothing to worry about. We have
a lot more champagne in the car.

587
01:25:47,495 --> 01:25:49,555
Professor!

588
01:25:50,465 --> 01:25:51,796
Yes!

589
01:25:52,734 --> 01:25:54,794
Where are you?

590
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:57,668
Behind the rock!

591
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:00,100
Behind which rock?

592
01:26:04,348 --> 01:26:07,340
This rock, you idiot. Come on.

593
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:19,959
Close the door and hurry it. Bring it up!

594
01:26:27,574 --> 01:26:28,940
We're safe up here.

595
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:30,905
Yeah, safe here.

596
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:39,043
Help!

597
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:46,725
My apologies.
There's a polar bear in our car.

598
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:51,664
If you don't leave this car immediately,
I shall personally feed you to the bear.

599
01:26:51,902 --> 01:26:55,202
If the bears don't get us,
we'll certainly freeze to death out there!

600
01:26:56,141 --> 01:26:59,577
As far as freezing is concerned,
you have the same chance that we have.

601
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:02,838
- Not if you put us out in the blizzard.
- Snowing very bad.

602
01:27:02,982 --> 01:27:06,645
May I point out
that you've completely demolished my top.

603
01:27:06,986 --> 01:27:10,787
And there's very little difference between
the blizzard out there and in here.

604
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:13,222
Except that you have blankets
and stimulants.

605
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:14,325
Stimulants.

606
01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:15,857
He's right.

607
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:18,031
Miss Dubois, you're not suggesting...

608
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,829
If two in a blanket stand
a better chance than one...

609
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,732
Then four in a blanket...

610
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,463
He's a cheat and a liar.

611
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,437
That's beside the point.

612
01:27:26,776 --> 01:27:28,574
The point is that we're freezing.

613
01:27:28,745 --> 01:27:32,374
Yes, and the time has come
to cast aside our personal differences.

614
01:27:32,616 --> 01:27:33,913
Bury the hatchet.

615
01:27:34,484 --> 01:27:36,282
And you know who has the hatchet.

616
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:39,150
He doesn't even have a whole moustache...

617
01:27:39,223 --> 01:27:42,489
...so why can't we settle this whole thing
underneath the blanket?

618
01:27:42,728 --> 01:27:45,697
We must get underneath
the blankets together. Close together.

619
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:49,896
Therefore, it will be necessary
to lower the seat.

620
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:52,468
Lower the seat!

621
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:55,301
Max, the back!

622
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:58,134
The foot. Watch that foot!

623
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:01,272
I beg your pardon.

624
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:02,883
Champagne, Professor?

625
01:28:03,051 --> 01:28:04,040
Thank you.

626
01:28:05,354 --> 01:28:07,345
Hey, this is terrific.

627
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:09,715
May I propose a toast?

628
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:13,686
What's so funny? Something wrong?

629
01:28:13,863 --> 01:28:16,094
What happened to your mustache?

630
01:28:16,266 --> 01:28:18,427
- I broke it off.
- You what?

631
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:21,503
I broke it off. It was frozen. Look.

632
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,791
What time is it?

633
01:28:42,764 --> 01:28:44,095
Just a moment.

634
01:28:57,547 --> 01:28:58,980
7:30.

635
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,583
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

636
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:07,986
Very big. The head very big.

637
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,753
Time to get up.

638
01:29:12,397 --> 01:29:14,763
Professor, time to get up.

639
01:29:15,534 --> 01:29:17,503
Come on, Professor, rise and shine.

640
01:29:18,671 --> 01:29:20,696
Rise and shine?

641
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:23,975
- 7:30.
- Then you rise, you shine.

642
01:29:25,012 --> 01:29:28,277
- He's always like this in the morning.
- I'm not always like this!

643
01:29:28,415 --> 01:29:30,816
This particular morning
I happen to be seasick.

644
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:32,880
Too much champagne.

645
01:29:32,954 --> 01:29:35,821
I'm not sick from champagne,
I'm sick from the sea!

646
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:39,927
- It's not necessary to yell at her.
- I'll yell at whoever I want to yell at!

647
01:29:40,095 --> 01:29:43,293
- He always yells like this.
- Let me out of here!

648
01:29:46,436 --> 01:29:50,703
7:30 in the morning,
you idiots, I'm seasick!

649
01:29:54,078 --> 01:29:56,069
Rise and shine.

650
01:30:01,086 --> 01:30:03,647
Help! Max!

651
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,218
I'm coming, Professor.

652
01:30:10,598 --> 01:30:12,190
I got you!

653
01:32:25,147 --> 01:32:27,138
You're wasting your time.

654
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,041
- Perhaps.
- We're melting.

655
01:32:31,054 --> 01:32:33,488
- Slowly.
- We're going to sink.

656
01:32:34,123 --> 01:32:37,320
- Eventually.
- Then you're wasting your time!

657
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:40,624
I shall place this log...

658
01:32:41,966 --> 01:32:44,936
...in a water-tight container, if found...

659
01:32:45,604 --> 01:32:49,665
...it shall provide valuable information
for those who may follow.

660
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:52,667
Valuable information for those
who may follow.

661
01:32:53,613 --> 01:32:56,013
Professor, I got an idea.

662
01:32:56,682 --> 01:32:59,880
Instead of the book, why don't you and me
get into the container?

663
01:32:59,987 --> 01:33:01,284
Shut up!

664
01:33:02,155 --> 01:33:04,089
- We got to do something.
- Don't worry.

665
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:08,327
Before this iceberg melts and we drown
like rats, we're going to do plenty.

666
01:33:09,497 --> 01:33:11,193
We're going to starve!

667
01:33:14,703 --> 01:33:17,638
Miss Dubois, I recommend
we have cold meals from now on...

668
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,766
...we're melting fast enough as it is.

669
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:23,935
What difference does it make?
A few hours one way or another.

670
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:27,275
Minutes have made the difference
in survival, Miss Dubois.

671
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:33,484
Mr. Leslie, I suspect you are being
unrealistically optimistic for my benefit.

672
01:33:34,092 --> 01:33:35,719
And it isn't at all necessary.

673
01:33:35,927 --> 01:33:40,592
We're lost on an iceberg,
and doomed to drift with the tide and melt.

674
01:33:43,903 --> 01:33:45,895
You're a brave woman, Miss Dubois.

675
01:33:47,107 --> 01:33:48,233
Red sky.

676
01:33:50,611 --> 01:33:51,840
So what?

677
01:33:52,314 --> 01:33:54,043
There's going to be a storm.

678
01:33:54,783 --> 01:33:56,444
What are you talking about?

679
01:33:57,018 --> 01:33:59,351
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor, take warning."

680
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:03,352
You thimble-headed gherkin,
do you realize the odds against a storm...

681
01:34:03,426 --> 01:34:06,828
...in this part of the ocean
at this time of year? 100-to-1.

682
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:22,947
Throw me a rope!

683
01:34:32,493 --> 01:34:34,961
"Red sky in the morning,
sailor, take warning."

684
01:34:35,696 --> 01:34:38,187
Why you, nincompoop!

685
01:34:42,637 --> 01:34:44,036
Max!

686
01:35:01,726 --> 01:35:02,852
Another foot.

687
01:35:03,128 --> 01:35:04,288
Another foot.

688
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:07,359
Thirty-seven inches to go.

689
01:35:07,733 --> 01:35:09,894
Thirty-seven inches to go.

690
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,933
At the rate we've been melting
that's good for about one more week.

691
01:35:14,274 --> 01:35:16,003
You better keep it to yourself.

692
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:18,944
Of course I'll keep it to myself.

693
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:24,315
Until the water reaches my lower lip,
then I'll mention it to somebody.

694
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:33,655
What was the professor
complaining about?

695
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:36,255
You know the professor.

696
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:40,296
He thinks we're melting too fast,
and he was venting his wrath on the gods.

697
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:43,467
Are we melting too fast?

698
01:35:43,974 --> 01:35:47,103
I don't think so.
According to my calculations...

699
01:35:47,479 --> 01:35:50,744
...we'll reach land just about the time
that our feet get wet.

700
01:35:59,226 --> 01:36:00,989
- I'm hungry.
- She's getting it.

701
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,356
How long does it take
to open a can of beans?

702
01:36:03,497 --> 01:36:05,624
The eternal struggle takes time, Max.

703
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:07,927
What struggle? She's got a can opener.

704
01:36:08,069 --> 01:36:12,563
You cork-brain, I'm talking about man,
woman, sex, conquest.

705
01:36:12,975 --> 01:36:14,135
What was that?

706
01:36:14,443 --> 01:36:18,004
He's making his move.
And I'm sure she's interested.

707
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,616
But unless I miss my guess
she will never submit.

708
01:36:20,784 --> 01:36:22,649
If she does, we won't get any beans.

709
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,247
It's a contest, and he's using weapons
that have toppled everything...

710
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,824
...from a Kansas farm girl
to a European duchess.

711
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:31,223
But she will counter with women's rights.

712
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:33,528
That's terrible.

713
01:36:34,299 --> 01:36:38,759
For a man like Leslie, that's terrible.
Like me, he must win on his own terms.

714
01:36:39,672 --> 01:36:42,334
She recognizes no terms except her own.

715
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:44,032
Come and get it.

716
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:45,500
You see?

717
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:49,482
Maybe she doesn't mean us.

718
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,540
Hey, Professor.

719
01:37:13,043 --> 01:37:15,342
Hey, Professor, up and at 'em.

720
01:37:16,848 --> 01:37:18,213
Up and at 'em?

721
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,785
- It's 7:30. Up and at 'em.
- "Up and at 'em!"

722
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:22,979
Don't yell!

723
01:37:23,289 --> 01:37:25,257
Always yells like that in the morning.

724
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:28,950
You idiot!
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em."

725
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:33,623
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em, it's 7:30."

726
01:37:35,036 --> 01:37:37,129
We're underwater!

727
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:40,808
We're underwater! We're doomed!

728
01:37:41,209 --> 01:37:43,677
- We'll make it.
- We'll make what?

729
01:37:44,012 --> 01:37:45,536
- Land.
- Land!

730
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:47,705
Land!

731
01:37:49,452 --> 01:37:51,977
It's probably East Cape.
I see a ship in the harbor.

732
01:37:52,355 --> 01:37:55,052
We're saved. We're saved!

733
01:37:55,526 --> 01:37:58,290
Max, we're saved! We're saved!

734
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:02,525
- I am Professor Fate!
- We're saved!

735
01:38:03,602 --> 01:38:05,536
Max, my trusty trout, the cannon.

736
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:08,637
Fire the cannon, let them know we're here!

737
01:38:13,379 --> 01:38:15,507
Push the button, Max!

738
01:38:20,355 --> 01:38:22,323
Max!

739
01:38:24,559 --> 01:38:26,550
Ahoy!

740
01:38:29,298 --> 01:38:31,163
Ahoy!

741
01:38:31,367 --> 01:38:34,895
Isn't it wonderful to see an American ship
in this godforsaken outpost?

742
01:38:35,138 --> 01:38:38,198
It is indeed. It's probably
from San Francisco or Seattle.

743
01:38:38,608 --> 01:38:40,907
Ahoy, iceberg.

744
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,079
It's me!

745
01:38:45,016 --> 01:38:46,643
It's me!

746
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:50,719
If I didn't know better I would say that's...

747
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,119
It's me!

748
01:38:55,294 --> 01:38:57,091
- Hezekiah.
- What?

749
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:05,364
You gave me your word and I trusted you.

750
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:09,168
Then you handcuffed Hezekiah
to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.

751
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:10,608
It was the Southern Pacific.

752
01:39:10,745 --> 01:39:13,407
What has that got to do with it?
You gave me your word.

753
01:39:13,515 --> 01:39:15,677
- You gave me no choice!
- You lie!

754
01:39:15,851 --> 01:39:17,785
I told you I would finish the race.

755
01:39:22,993 --> 01:39:25,962
- Push the button, Max.
- Are you sure this is such a good idea?

756
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:28,690
She is his Achilles' heel,
she is our ace in the hole.

757
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,268
- She must not be left behind now, Max!
- I know!

758
01:39:31,602 --> 01:39:33,001
Push the button.

759
01:39:42,148 --> 01:39:43,672
But you can't leave me here.

760
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:45,181
Boss!

761
01:39:57,099 --> 01:40:00,364
We want jobs. We want jobs.

762
01:40:03,005 --> 01:40:04,267
Frisbee?

763
01:40:05,908 --> 01:40:07,136
Frisbee!

764
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:11,811
Frisbee?

765
01:40:12,082 --> 01:40:13,811
I'm sorry, dear.

766
01:40:14,786 --> 01:40:16,651
- Capitulate, Henry.
- Never.

767
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:21,119
Well, remember we're having the Simpsons
to dinner. Now try not to be late.

768
01:40:21,861 --> 01:40:23,419
Excuse me.

769
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:28,033
I'm sorry, dear.

770
01:40:28,268 --> 01:40:30,168
I could hardly get across the hall.

771
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:33,137
Why are you complaining?
I have to sleep with their leader.

772
01:40:33,206 --> 01:40:34,571
This is from Reuters.

773
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:36,472
"Last report dated March 10.

774
01:40:36,611 --> 01:40:39,705
"Fate's car still in lead
and nearing Srednek Kolimsk."

775
01:40:41,382 --> 01:40:44,079
They could have reached
the Lena River by now.

776
01:41:02,207 --> 01:41:04,402
- Hey, Professor, what is this?
- Shut up.

777
01:41:36,947 --> 01:41:39,313
You give them beads, makes them friendly.

778
01:41:40,851 --> 01:41:42,979
Obviously, they don't know who I am.

779
01:41:49,428 --> 01:41:52,261
I am professor Fate!

780
01:42:06,714 --> 01:42:08,272
You want to try the beads?

781
01:42:09,985 --> 01:42:11,714
What is the word for "friends"?

782
01:42:11,853 --> 01:42:13,047
- Professor...
- Shut up!

783
01:42:13,154 --> 01:42:15,715
- I don't know this language.
- Get the dictionary.

784
01:42:18,694 --> 01:42:20,161
- I've got it.
- What is it?

785
01:42:21,297 --> 01:42:22,822
I can't pronounce it.

786
01:42:27,871 --> 01:42:28,895
Very simple.

787
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:33,271
- "Drozia."
- Drozia.

788
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:40,410
I speak, read and write French,
Russian and Arabic.

789
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:13,649
Max, stick with the car!

790
01:43:25,104 --> 01:43:27,572
She don't act like she's being kidnapped.

791
01:43:32,245 --> 01:43:33,837
Max!

792
01:43:40,121 --> 01:43:44,081
Boss, this dispatch just came in
from Maggie Dubois.

793
01:43:44,893 --> 01:43:46,986
"Have crossed Carpanian border.

794
01:43:47,162 --> 01:43:49,996
"No contact with Leslie's car
in nearly three weeks.

795
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,794
"So there's no way of telling
who's in the lead."

796
01:43:55,105 --> 01:43:57,870
The Webber Motor Car Company built
the Leslie Special.

797
01:43:58,075 --> 01:43:59,906
- Have they integrated yet?
- No.

798
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:02,504
They still refuse to hire any women.

799
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:05,882
Until Webber changes its policy,
there will be no mention...

800
01:44:05,951 --> 01:44:08,146
...of the Leslie Special in this newspaper.

801
01:44:08,253 --> 01:44:10,882
But you can't do that.
We'll lose their advertising.

802
01:44:12,225 --> 01:44:14,921
Mr. Frisbee, until my husband is released...

803
01:44:15,028 --> 01:44:17,623
...from Happy Acres, I am in charge here.

804
01:44:17,831 --> 01:44:19,025
Yes, sir... Ma'am.

805
01:44:19,299 --> 01:44:20,391
Now, let's see.

806
01:44:21,035 --> 01:44:24,972
They should be approaching
the next gasoline stop...

807
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:27,335
...which is Potzdorf.

808
01:45:16,932 --> 01:45:18,560
I am General Kuhster.

809
01:45:18,768 --> 01:45:21,862
I will escort you to the palace
where you will be the guests...

810
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:24,270
...of His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.

811
01:45:25,075 --> 01:45:26,508
We are deeply honored.

812
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:32,013
Who's Prince Hapnick?

813
01:45:32,217 --> 01:45:34,549
He's the royal heir to the throne.

814
01:47:04,222 --> 01:47:06,623
I say we should've dumped her
a long time ago!

815
01:47:06,758 --> 01:47:09,727
I say we shall dump her
when I say we'll dump her!

816
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:11,796
She's playing you for a sucker!

817
01:47:15,535 --> 01:47:17,002
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

818
01:47:25,947 --> 01:47:27,175
What do you want?

819
01:47:28,783 --> 01:47:29,772
Who are you?

820
01:47:30,619 --> 01:47:32,611
Professor Fate. And who might you be?

821
01:47:32,955 --> 01:47:35,185
- Incredible.
- Amazing.

822
01:47:38,662 --> 01:47:39,754
Unhand me.

823
01:47:39,896 --> 01:47:42,194
I found this wildcat swimming in the lake.

824
01:47:42,432 --> 01:47:44,593
I demand to know what this is all about?

825
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:46,901
It's very simple:

826
01:47:47,272 --> 01:47:49,536
You and your friends are under arrest.

827
01:48:08,329 --> 01:48:11,264
- Will you be in Potzdorf long, Mr. Leslie?
- I'm afraid not.

828
01:48:11,532 --> 01:48:13,364
We leave tomorrow morning. Early.

829
01:48:13,602 --> 01:48:16,435
Where is your competitor,
this Professor Fate?

830
01:48:16,805 --> 01:48:20,469
- I suspect not far behind.
- Lf he ain't ahead of us already.

831
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,942
Have you met the Crown Prince yet,
Mr. Leslie?

832
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:24,671
No, I haven't had the honor.

833
01:48:31,822 --> 01:48:35,350
His Royal Highness,
Crown Prince Frederick Hapnick!

834
01:48:59,388 --> 01:49:00,514
Hey, boss...

835
01:49:00,889 --> 01:49:03,357
- Yeah, but that's...
- No, it isn't.

836
01:49:09,432 --> 01:49:11,024
That was exhausting.

837
01:49:24,816 --> 01:49:26,114
Your Highness!

838
01:49:34,294 --> 01:49:38,162
Your highness,
may I present the Great Leslie.

839
01:49:38,298 --> 01:49:41,427
- Your Highness.
- And this is Mr. Hezekiah.

840
01:49:42,003 --> 01:49:44,494
Welcome to Potzdorf.

841
01:49:44,973 --> 01:49:48,671
Excuse me, Your Highness, but do you
have any relatives in the United States?

842
01:49:48,778 --> 01:49:50,939
Me? Relatives in the States?

843
01:49:52,448 --> 01:49:55,179
It's of no consequence, Sire.
It's just that you bear...

844
01:49:55,252 --> 01:49:57,777
...an uncanny resemblance
to someone we both know.

845
01:49:57,954 --> 01:49:59,946
- Someone who looks like me?
- Yes, sir.

846
01:50:05,797 --> 01:50:06,730
Poor fellow.

847
01:50:56,088 --> 01:50:58,022
May I have the honor of this dance?

848
01:52:08,305 --> 01:52:10,830
In the Kingdom of Carpania
if one doesn't waltz...

849
01:52:10,941 --> 01:52:13,341
...one doesn't dance. And I love to dance.

850
01:52:13,844 --> 01:52:15,835
Only problem is, I hate the waltz.

851
01:52:16,914 --> 01:52:19,542
I waltz just enough to comply
with tradition...

852
01:52:19,684 --> 01:52:22,210
...then I sneak off
to more rewarding activities.

853
01:52:22,321 --> 01:52:23,447
Brandy!

854
01:52:23,822 --> 01:52:26,382
I should have scheduled
divine entertainment for you:

855
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:29,427
Carpania's full of forests.
The forests are full of gypsies...

856
01:52:29,596 --> 01:52:33,032
...and the gypsies are full of shenanigans
such as swallowing swords...

857
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,225
...and chewing broken glass, eating fire.

858
01:52:35,336 --> 01:52:37,395
It's wonderful!
I don't know how they do it.

859
01:52:37,504 --> 01:52:39,904
Your Highness should visit India one day.

860
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:44,772
India, isn't that where they have
those Hindu persons walking on hot coals?

861
01:52:44,879 --> 01:52:46,141
And lie on nails!

862
01:52:46,915 --> 01:52:49,077
They train those hideous snakes!

863
01:52:50,987 --> 01:52:54,355
I think I'm supposed to go to India,
after I assume the throne...

864
01:52:54,558 --> 01:52:56,526
- Do we go to India, General?
- Yes.

865
01:52:56,693 --> 01:53:01,063
Good, I can hardly wait.
Sit. Here, have a cigar.

866
01:53:01,532 --> 01:53:04,933
The coronation is tomorrow.
I hope you'll stay, you Great Leslie, you.

867
01:53:05,036 --> 01:53:06,731
I'd be most honored, Your Highness.

868
01:53:06,804 --> 01:53:11,265
But if you attend the coronation,
won't you lose time in your race to Paris?

869
01:53:11,377 --> 01:53:14,870
Since there hasn't been report
Professor Fate has crossed your border...

870
01:53:14,981 --> 01:53:16,778
...I assume that I'm in the lead.

871
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:18,841
But he might cross at any moment.

872
01:53:20,053 --> 01:53:22,022
It's been my experience, General...

873
01:53:23,157 --> 01:53:26,456
...that there is little advantage
to winning if one wins too easily.

874
01:53:30,699 --> 01:53:32,724
What do you say to that, General?

875
01:53:33,235 --> 01:53:35,966
An admirable point of view.
For anyone, but a soldier.

876
01:53:36,472 --> 01:53:41,137
In my profession, to win is imperative.
To win easily is a blessing.

877
01:53:43,313 --> 01:53:47,079
Yes, blessing. He has terrible mottos
written all over his walls like:

878
01:53:47,685 --> 01:53:51,247
"If a good soldier dies with his boots on,
rest assured they're polished."

879
01:53:54,426 --> 01:53:58,124
- Good evening, Your Highness.
- Rolfe, you rogue, where have you been?

880
01:53:58,264 --> 01:54:01,723
My apologies for being late,
Your Highness, but I was delayed by...

881
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:03,096
...some last minute business.

882
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,798
You haven't been dueling again,
you naughty boy.

883
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,536
No, Your Highness.

884
01:54:10,078 --> 01:54:13,206
Mr. Leslie, this is Baron Rolfe Von Stuppe.

885
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,617
Baron Von Stuppe,
is Carpania's greatest swordsman.

886
01:54:16,785 --> 01:54:18,980
Matter of fact,
his prowess with the blade...

887
01:54:19,088 --> 01:54:21,853
...is surpassed only by his reputation
with the ladies.

888
01:54:21,958 --> 01:54:23,357
- Baron.
- I'm honored.

889
01:54:23,526 --> 01:54:27,485
Sit and drink up. The evening's young,
we're all going to have such a gay...

890
01:54:27,664 --> 01:54:29,496
Brandy! What kept you?

891
01:54:31,836 --> 01:54:33,827
What makes you so great, Mr. Leslie?

892
01:54:35,073 --> 01:54:39,407
Greatness is a light-hearted title
for theatrical amusements.

893
01:54:40,145 --> 01:54:42,671
Or a definition endowed on men...

894
01:54:42,815 --> 01:54:45,181
...too long dead
to know that its been awarded.

895
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,486
I'm simply Leslie.

896
01:54:49,356 --> 01:54:51,483
And I'm at your service, Your Highness.

897
01:55:07,676 --> 01:55:08,871
Goodness gracious.

898
01:55:09,146 --> 01:55:11,910
You know there's one thing wrong
with living in a palace:

899
01:55:12,015 --> 01:55:14,643
It takes so long to get from one place
to another.

900
01:55:14,785 --> 01:55:17,755
I live in a constant state of exhaustion.
Poor Prince!

901
01:55:18,122 --> 01:55:21,558
One good thing, when one was young,
you could play along the corridors.

902
01:55:21,726 --> 01:55:25,424
I used to ride my pony up and down
this corridor when I was young.

903
01:55:25,531 --> 01:55:27,761
Then I grew up and got drunk, and fell off.

904
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:34,563
I'm going to bed, now.

905
01:55:35,743 --> 01:55:37,210
Good night, Your Highness.

906
01:55:37,311 --> 01:55:39,836
- Who is going to tuck me in?
- I can manage that.

907
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:42,973
No. You're the sloppiest tucker-inner
in all Potzdorf.

908
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:46,576
If there's anything I abhor,
it's a sloppy tucker-inner.

909
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:53,224
Good night, you good Leslie, you.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

910
01:56:01,238 --> 01:56:02,797
There, kids.

911
01:56:05,677 --> 01:56:07,440
They've been waiting for me.

912
01:56:13,252 --> 01:56:14,947
Mumsey...

913
01:56:15,354 --> 01:56:19,291
...l'm afraid I had
a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.

914
01:56:20,126 --> 01:56:23,961
But then again, I always have
a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.

915
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:29,128
Because Mumsey isn't here to scold me.

916
01:56:29,538 --> 01:56:31,301
I wish Mumsey were here.

917
01:57:02,676 --> 01:57:04,166
Hello.

918
01:57:08,815 --> 01:57:10,579
Good night, Mumsey.

919
01:57:34,712 --> 01:57:36,043
Running like a top.

920
01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:41,585
Good mechanics always
got to keep checking. Every little thing.

921
01:57:41,987 --> 01:57:43,319
A beautiful machine.

922
01:57:43,623 --> 01:57:44,783
Indeed it is.

923
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:48,651
And you make sure nobody gets nearer
than 50 feet to it, you understand?

924
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:51,795
Unless of course, it's me or...

925
01:57:52,099 --> 01:57:53,794
...Mr. Leslie.
- Don't worry.

926
01:57:54,635 --> 01:57:56,467
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

927
01:57:56,972 --> 01:57:58,701
Looks like a beautiful night.

928
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:04,775
I think I'll just take
a little stroll around the palace.

929
01:58:22,033 --> 01:58:23,524
Don't make too much noise.

930
01:58:24,169 --> 01:58:25,397
It's a secret.

931
01:58:25,871 --> 01:58:27,862
A secret? I love secrets.

932
01:58:29,708 --> 01:58:32,439
- What's the secret?
- What we're doing, your Highness.

933
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:35,474
We're going to take you for a little ride.

934
01:58:36,049 --> 01:58:38,041
Good. Where are we going?

935
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:40,210
For a little ride, your Highness.

936
01:58:42,957 --> 01:58:44,255
In you go.

937
01:58:50,166 --> 01:58:51,497
Speed on.

938
01:59:05,683 --> 01:59:08,516
King, I'm going to be king.

939
01:59:45,696 --> 01:59:48,256
It'll do no good
to get the bars out off the windows.

940
01:59:48,399 --> 01:59:49,832
You and your stupid ideas.

941
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,333
Max can't accomplish anything
with a pen knife.

942
01:59:52,537 --> 01:59:54,937
And if he could,
it's at least a 100-foot drop.

943
02:00:05,285 --> 02:00:10,348
Unhand me! You blackguards, scoundrels!
Unhand me!

944
02:00:10,624 --> 02:00:12,684
I demand to see the American Consul.

945
02:00:14,129 --> 02:00:16,063
You blundering idiots!

946
02:00:16,297 --> 02:00:19,893
You'll answer to my government
for this outrage! Outrage!

947
02:00:20,269 --> 02:00:23,796
You have kidnapped me.
Fate the Magnificent!

948
02:00:23,973 --> 02:00:26,943
Let's get practical.
I don't care what you do to the others...

949
02:00:27,043 --> 02:00:29,671
...as long as you let me go.
What do you say to $500?

950
02:00:44,464 --> 02:00:45,795
Professor...

951
02:00:46,966 --> 02:00:50,129
...allow me to present
His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.

952
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:52,302
Heir to the throne of Carpania.

953
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:03,884
Hi, there.

954
02:01:19,604 --> 02:01:20,764
It's out!

955
02:01:55,378 --> 02:01:56,140
No!

956
02:01:56,446 --> 02:01:58,073
I suggest you reconsider.

957
02:01:58,616 --> 02:01:59,947
I won't do it!

958
02:02:00,985 --> 02:02:02,976
Then you leave us no alternative.

959
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:04,209
I'll do it.

960
02:02:06,224 --> 02:02:08,283
Don't just stand there, do something.

961
02:02:08,994 --> 02:02:11,053
Hezekiah, please wake up.

962
02:02:12,064 --> 02:02:13,156
Hezekiah?

963
02:02:15,234 --> 02:02:16,633
Please, Hezekiah.

964
02:02:17,737 --> 02:02:18,727
Max!

965
02:02:21,675 --> 02:02:23,040
Open this door!

966
02:02:23,477 --> 02:02:25,969
Max, you little rat! I'll get you for this.

967
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:42,764
By tomorrow, you'll be king.

968
02:02:43,033 --> 02:02:46,629
After that you declare General Kuhster
chancellor and quietly abdicate.

969
02:02:47,605 --> 02:02:51,439
Your Highness,
remember one slip and you're dead.

970
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,977
Aren't we all?

971
02:03:21,844 --> 02:03:22,902
Good evening.

972
02:03:25,214 --> 02:03:28,378
When we get back to the palace,
you must trim your mustache.

973
02:03:28,585 --> 02:03:30,678
You must look exactly like the prince.

974
02:03:31,755 --> 02:03:32,984
Can you laugh?

975
02:03:33,391 --> 02:03:35,018
What do you mean can I laugh?

976
02:03:35,126 --> 02:03:37,890
- The prince has a very individual laugh.
- Like what?

977
02:03:46,506 --> 02:03:50,272
No, that's much too bass.
The prince is more of a soprano. Try it.

978
02:03:51,678 --> 02:03:53,078
Try it once more.

979
02:04:36,396 --> 02:04:38,523
I demand to know what this is all about.

980
02:04:38,632 --> 02:04:40,760
You've been told. You're under arrest.

981
02:04:41,068 --> 02:04:42,501
I know, but for what?

982
02:04:42,603 --> 02:04:44,594
- Spying.
- Spying?

983
02:04:51,947 --> 02:04:56,078
At last, the Great Leslie is finished.
I've won!

984
02:04:56,286 --> 02:04:59,255
They said I never could. Get off of the bed!

985
02:04:59,589 --> 02:05:03,424
Don't you try any double-crosses,
my friend, keep our deal.

986
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:06,597
He stays in the pokey
until I'm safely in Paris.

987
02:05:06,698 --> 02:05:09,826
When it comes to double-crossers,
you are looking at the king!

988
02:05:10,902 --> 02:05:14,134
Not until you've trimmed your mustache,
Your Majesty.

989
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:19,576
I hate you.

990
02:05:55,487 --> 02:05:57,250
I've come to see the Great Leslie.

991
02:05:57,356 --> 02:05:59,950
I'm sorry, Padre,
I can't let anyone see the prisoner...

992
02:06:00,025 --> 02:06:01,653
...without the proper authority.

993
02:06:01,761 --> 02:06:03,820
I understand. Bless you, my son.

994
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:36,424
Leslie!

995
02:06:36,601 --> 02:06:38,364
I'm here. In here.

996
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:47,305
- Max!
- We've got to save the professor.

997
02:06:48,248 --> 02:06:50,216
What about Miss Dubois and Hezekiah?

998
02:06:50,383 --> 02:06:52,214
- They're with the baron.
- The baron?

999
02:06:52,586 --> 02:06:55,147
He's got everybody.
We've got to go save the professor.

1000
02:07:23,221 --> 02:07:25,086
Stop! Stop!

1001
02:07:27,258 --> 02:07:28,021
Escaped?

1002
02:07:28,327 --> 02:07:29,954
With a small friar.

1003
02:07:30,363 --> 02:07:32,354
Leslie escaped with a chicken?

1004
02:07:32,531 --> 02:07:35,933
No, you idiot, with a friar.
A monk. A priest.

1005
02:07:36,236 --> 02:07:37,362
What should we do?

1006
02:07:37,437 --> 02:07:39,632
The coronation must take place
without delay.

1007
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:42,574
With Leslie free, every minute counts.

1008
02:07:48,717 --> 02:07:51,709
You're right. With Leslie on the loose,
every second counts.

1009
02:07:55,659 --> 02:07:58,219
Are you sure that the baron's castle
is on a lake?

1010
02:07:58,428 --> 02:08:00,191
I'm positive. Great big lake.

1011
02:08:00,363 --> 02:08:02,992
And the only lake on this map
is straight ahead.

1012
02:08:07,405 --> 02:08:08,896
You're not serious?

1013
02:08:09,741 --> 02:08:11,140
Deadly serious.

1014
02:08:12,411 --> 02:08:14,038
You're a sadistic fiend.

1015
02:08:14,546 --> 02:08:17,710
He has only to answer
a few simple questions.

1016
02:08:17,984 --> 02:08:19,975
Not the mustache.

1017
02:08:22,456 --> 02:08:24,117
Why did you come here?

1018
02:08:25,859 --> 02:08:27,121
Who sent you?

1019
02:08:29,364 --> 02:08:30,956
- Proceed.
- No!

1020
02:08:32,033 --> 02:08:34,467
Touch one hair on his head
and you'll answer to...

1021
02:08:34,536 --> 02:08:37,597
...Teddy Roosevelt
and the United States government!

1022
02:08:37,673 --> 02:08:39,868
"My country 'tis of thee

1023
02:08:40,109 --> 02:08:44,479
"Sweet land of liberty of thee I sing"

1024
02:08:52,724 --> 02:08:56,252
That's it. On the lake.
Come on, we'll save the professor.

1025
02:08:57,262 --> 02:09:01,358
Maximillian, if Miss Dubois and Hezekiah
are not in that castle...

1026
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:04,664
They're there, I swear it.
Come on, save the professor.

1027
02:09:07,173 --> 02:09:09,699
They're there. Cross my heart.

1028
02:09:15,183 --> 02:09:17,014
Terrific.

1029
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:22,321
What's more, do as I tell you.
Stay down. Down.

1030
02:09:27,730 --> 02:09:30,632
"Land where our fathers died

1031
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:36,338
"Land of thy pilgrim's pride
from every mountainside

1032
02:09:36,541 --> 02:09:39,169
"Let freedom ring"

1033
02:09:40,145 --> 02:09:41,635
Shut up, Professor.

1034
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,356
They're there.

1035
02:12:11,018 --> 02:12:13,179
Here comes the Marines!

1036
02:13:29,374 --> 02:13:30,808
Good evening, Baron.

1037
02:13:31,344 --> 02:13:33,778
Well, Mr. Leslie.

1038
02:13:34,781 --> 02:13:36,442
What a pleasant surprise.

1039
02:13:37,116 --> 02:13:39,608
I half expected to see you again, but...

1040
02:13:41,055 --> 02:13:42,852
...not with a sword in your hand.

1041
02:13:43,157 --> 02:13:44,625
Do you prefer the foil?

1042
02:13:44,759 --> 02:13:47,193
Not particularly.
It happened to be convenient.

1043
02:13:47,295 --> 02:13:49,229
I presume you know how to use one.

1044
02:13:50,632 --> 02:13:52,624
I hope that won't be necessary.

1045
02:13:53,436 --> 02:13:54,733
I'm sure you do.

1046
02:13:58,408 --> 02:14:01,036
Will you release Miss Dubois
and the others?

1047
02:14:01,978 --> 02:14:04,209
- No.
- I'm afraid this will be necessary.

1048
02:14:04,515 --> 02:14:06,244
You're being very foolish.

1049
02:14:06,551 --> 02:14:10,317
That's an assumption, Baron. You make
me the victim even before we start.

1050
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:12,448
It's your life.

1051
02:14:12,958 --> 02:14:16,257
You're assuming again. En garde.

1052
02:14:39,021 --> 02:14:42,184
Very adroit, Mr. Leslie. Very skilled.

1053
02:15:08,388 --> 02:15:12,257
My compliments, Mr. Leslie.
You handle the foil very well.

1054
02:15:12,627 --> 02:15:14,288
Thank you, Baron. So do you.

1055
02:15:14,529 --> 02:15:18,091
Personally, I prefer a man's weapon.
How are you with a saber?

1056
02:15:18,433 --> 02:15:20,230
There's only one way to find out.

1057
02:15:39,457 --> 02:15:41,084
Surround him!

1058
02:15:42,894 --> 02:15:44,828
Look out! Look out!

1059
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:49,192
Oh, the smoke!

1060
02:17:29,417 --> 02:17:30,645
Running away, Baron?

1061
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:33,017
As a very wise English gentleman
once said:

1062
02:17:33,088 --> 02:17:36,285
"He who fights and runs away,
may live to fight another day."

1063
02:17:36,491 --> 02:17:39,153
So until another day, Mr. Leslie.

1064
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:45,498
Please excuse me. I have a boat waiting.

1065
02:19:09,331 --> 02:19:10,662
Faster!

1066
02:20:46,376 --> 02:20:48,937
Professor, the jig is up.

1067
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:13,432
Your Highness.

1068
02:21:14,342 --> 02:21:17,675
Your Royal Highness.
Your Royal Highness!

1069
02:21:39,637 --> 02:21:43,631
Wait, Your Royal Highness! My prince!

1070
02:21:52,552 --> 02:21:54,179
Out of the way!

1071
02:21:56,657 --> 02:21:58,454
Your Highness.

1072
02:22:22,754 --> 02:22:26,121
Your Highness,
we've got to get out of here!

1073
02:22:37,737 --> 02:22:40,934
You wouldn't dare!

1074
02:22:56,559 --> 02:22:57,548
Please!

1075
02:23:13,311 --> 02:23:15,644
Wait for me. Wait for me.

1076
02:23:34,669 --> 02:23:36,228
- Your Majesty.
- Hi, there.

1077
02:23:44,647 --> 02:23:45,909
Brandy!

1078
02:23:46,316 --> 02:23:47,613
Throw more brandy.

1079
02:23:49,253 --> 02:23:50,777
More brandy.

1080
02:23:51,388 --> 02:23:53,720
Brandy. Throw more brandy.

1081
02:23:57,329 --> 02:24:01,698
Rum. I never mix my pies.
I want to play, too.

1082
02:24:13,113 --> 02:24:14,671
Miss Dubois!

1083
02:24:19,454 --> 02:24:20,819
Hey, Professor!

1084
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:26,188
Hey, Professor.

1085
02:24:41,512 --> 02:24:43,174
Hey, Professor!

1086
02:24:49,121 --> 02:24:52,216
You. You're the cause of it all.
It was your idea.

1087
02:24:52,425 --> 02:24:54,757
No, Your Highness.
It was Baron Von Stuppe.

1088
02:24:54,861 --> 02:24:57,831
I don't care. You're banished!

1089
02:24:57,932 --> 02:25:02,369
I'm getting a new tucker-inner.
Banished, banished!

1090
02:25:10,847 --> 02:25:12,439
Miss Dubois!

1091
02:25:20,891 --> 02:25:22,256
Hey, Professor!

1092
02:25:24,963 --> 02:25:28,990
- Hey, Professor, where are you?
- Right here, you idiot.

1093
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:32,598
Terrific. Let's go. I got the car.

1094
02:25:33,138 --> 02:25:35,766
More pies! More pies!

1095
02:25:40,947 --> 02:25:43,212
Oh, Leslie! Leslie!

1096
02:26:00,103 --> 02:26:03,335
Goodbye. Farewell, you good Leslie, you.

1097
02:26:03,574 --> 02:26:06,407
I hope you win. I hope you win!

1098
02:26:07,511 --> 02:26:09,604
I'll miss him. Oh, there it is!

1099
02:26:11,683 --> 02:26:13,082
General?

1100
02:26:54,899 --> 02:26:56,560
E Flat.

1101
02:27:02,607 --> 02:27:04,576
I think I better go and fix the car.

1102
02:28:39,152 --> 02:28:41,347
- Miss Dubois.
- Yes?

1103
02:28:43,356 --> 02:28:46,849
I believe the time has come for us
to resolve our differences.

1104
02:28:48,396 --> 02:28:49,556
Good.

1105
02:28:51,633 --> 02:28:55,592
As you know, I've steadfastly maintained...

1106
02:28:55,871 --> 02:29:00,366
...an uncompromising position about
women's rights and the equality of sexes.

1107
02:29:01,177 --> 02:29:02,508
As have I.

1108
02:29:03,613 --> 02:29:07,675
Therefore, it is safe to assume that
has been the principal area of our conflict.

1109
02:29:08,886 --> 02:29:10,376
No doubt about it.

1110
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:15,025
Therefore,
in the interest of progress and harmony...

1111
02:29:15,193 --> 02:29:17,889
...I am willing to concede
to your point of view.

1112
02:29:21,567 --> 02:29:22,898
Concede?

1113
02:29:27,407 --> 02:29:30,274
You are an emancipated woman,
Miss Dubois.

1114
02:29:30,811 --> 02:29:33,679
And I am an emancipated man.

1115
02:30:20,802 --> 02:30:22,497
Come back here.

1116
02:30:26,175 --> 02:30:29,440
You are the most unreasonable,
inconsistent female...

1117
02:30:29,579 --> 02:30:31,809
- I'm unreasonable? I'm inconsistent?
- Yes.

1118
02:30:32,048 --> 02:30:34,074
What about you? Talk about inconsistent.

1119
02:30:34,151 --> 02:30:36,449
- Inconsistent!
- And unreasonable.

1120
02:30:36,553 --> 02:30:38,350
- Unreasonable!
- And arrogant.

1121
02:30:38,455 --> 02:30:40,424
- Arrogant!
- Yes, arrogant!

1122
02:30:40,491 --> 02:30:43,688
All right, Miss Dubois,
let's discuss arrogance for a moment.

1123
02:30:43,761 --> 02:30:45,889
All right, Mr. Leslie. Let's.

1124
02:30:49,735 --> 02:30:54,332
Any woman who has the unmitigated
arrogance to consider herself man's equal.

1125
02:30:54,407 --> 02:30:58,173
Any man who has the arrogance
to consider himself better than a woman.

1126
02:30:58,245 --> 02:31:01,374
- Any fool knows that a woman cannot...
- That's right! Any fool!

1127
02:31:01,549 --> 02:31:05,280
- You know what's the matter with you?
- I know what's the matter with you.

1128
02:31:06,622 --> 02:31:07,884
What did I tell you?

1129
02:31:07,956 --> 02:31:10,948
She's going to win the race for us.
The buffalo-headed vixen!

1130
02:31:12,327 --> 02:31:14,626
- I tried to kiss you.
- I know what you tried.

1131
02:31:14,697 --> 02:31:17,165
You're the one
that's been preaching emancipation.

1132
02:31:31,249 --> 02:31:35,346
We're going to win, Max.
We're going to win!

1133
02:31:35,955 --> 02:31:38,549
I think you turn right at the next corner.

1134
02:31:51,306 --> 02:31:54,743
- You're not talking about equal rights.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1135
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:57,938
You're talking about
some convenient feminine utopia...

1136
02:31:58,347 --> 02:32:01,181
...that has all of the advantages
and no responsibilities.

1137
02:32:01,284 --> 02:32:02,649
- Responsibilities?
- Yes!

1138
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:05,449
Look who's talking about responsibilities.
Turn right.

1139
02:32:08,726 --> 02:32:11,854
- Go back and turn right.
- We do not turn right.

1140
02:32:11,929 --> 02:32:13,864
- I know Paris.
- So do I.

1141
02:32:13,932 --> 02:32:16,958
You have to turn right
in order to get to the Eiffel Tower.

1142
02:32:17,035 --> 02:32:20,528
If we turn right back there,
we'd end up on the Montmartre Steps.

1143
02:32:44,133 --> 02:32:46,967
You talk a good fight,
but when it comes down to it...

1144
02:32:47,037 --> 02:32:50,768
...you're as emancipated
as a confirmed spinster in a knitting bee.

1145
02:32:50,841 --> 02:32:52,308
How would you know?

1146
02:32:52,376 --> 02:32:56,177
You're a suffragette. You're the one
who wanted to bring sex out in the open.

1147
02:32:56,514 --> 02:33:00,508
So I brought it out into the open and
I got slapped in the face for my trouble.

1148
02:33:00,953 --> 02:33:05,617
Your interpretation of bringing sex out into
the open and mine are two different things.

1149
02:33:05,691 --> 02:33:08,718
Well, will you please tell me
what your concept of sex is?

1150
02:33:08,795 --> 02:33:09,921
Gladly!

1151
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:26,604
You and your stupid map!

1152
02:33:26,748 --> 02:33:30,048
She's still with him. You said
if she was with him, we couldn't lose.

1153
02:33:30,186 --> 02:33:30,743
Shut up!

1154
02:33:51,911 --> 02:33:55,473
And because I consider myself sexually free
and morally emancipated...

1155
02:33:55,615 --> 02:34:00,177
...l'm a responsible, discriminating woman
who doesn't intend to jump into bed...

1156
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:03,984
...with the first muscular egocentric male
who thinks he can seduce me...

1157
02:34:04,091 --> 02:34:07,255
...by agreeing with some of the things
I believe in.

1158
02:34:07,329 --> 02:34:10,059
- I only wanted to kiss you.
- Why?

1159
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:12,130
Because I love you, that's why.

1160
02:34:13,135 --> 02:34:15,604
- You don't believe me?
- I do not.

1161
02:34:19,742 --> 02:34:21,973
- What are you doing?
- Proving that I love you.

1162
02:34:22,046 --> 02:34:23,570
You'll lose the race.

1163
02:34:23,747 --> 02:34:25,942
Can you think of a better way to prove it?

1164
02:34:39,198 --> 02:34:41,030
Max, I won!

1165
02:34:42,469 --> 02:34:45,370
- I won!
- We won!

1166
02:34:45,572 --> 02:34:46,869
- I won!
- We won!

1167
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:51,544
- I am invincible!
- We won!

1168
02:34:51,679 --> 02:34:53,544
I have beaten Leslie at last.

1169
02:34:56,051 --> 02:34:58,042
The world is mine!

1170
02:35:05,795 --> 02:35:07,285
You lost.

1171
02:35:07,932 --> 02:35:09,422
Only the race.

1172
02:35:12,937 --> 02:35:14,929
I am king!

1173
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:17,401
I am the king.

1174
02:35:17,643 --> 02:35:22,775
No, I'm not! I didn't beat him.
He let me win!

1175
02:35:23,182 --> 02:35:25,582
I can't win this way.
I can only win one way:

1176
02:35:25,718 --> 02:35:27,949
My way! They let me win!

1177
02:35:28,088 --> 02:35:31,888
I can't win your way. You cheated.

1178
02:35:32,326 --> 02:35:33,657
You cheated.

1179
02:35:34,428 --> 02:35:37,660
You cheated! You cheated!

1180
02:35:38,133 --> 02:35:40,829
You cheated. I hate you.

1181
02:35:41,370 --> 02:35:43,361
I refuse to accept!

1182
02:35:43,573 --> 02:35:46,667
I won't win any way but my way.
You ruined my reputation!

1183
02:35:46,776 --> 02:35:49,439
Do you hear? You, I hate!

1184
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,841
You with your hair that is always combed.

1185
02:35:51,915 --> 02:35:55,010
Your suit is always white.
Your car is always clean.

1186
02:35:55,153 --> 02:36:00,022
I refuse to accept.
I challenge you to another race.

1187
02:36:03,295 --> 02:36:05,263
- Get off my hood.
- Another race!

1188
02:36:54,620 --> 02:36:56,612
Come on, Professor, go!

1189
02:36:59,026 --> 02:37:00,493
Come on, go, go!

1190
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:04,292
Relax, this time
I'm going to win it my way.

1191
02:37:06,167 --> 02:37:07,828
Push the button, Max!

1192
02:37:08,305 --> 02:38:08,755
