<i>Yumi's Cells 2</i>

3
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,070
<i>Episode 39: Laptop</i>

4
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,540
First place is mine! Mine!

5
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh yeah! First place! First place!

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,580
The unique sweetness is gone. It's no fun!

7
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,810
Writer Kim Yumi, are you going through a hard
time? This is like a funeral march dragging on.

8
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,410
Why did you make a sequel? Just
end it if you don't have anything to say.

9
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,950
<i>I can't read this anymore. I'm leaving now.</i>

10
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,440
What?

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,650
<i>Oh yeah! First place!
The unique sweetness has disappeared.</i>

12
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,960
Everything is malicious comments.

13
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,160
It's because it's so popular. There are
no malicious comments if it's not popular.

14
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,640
But still, there are too many malicious comments these days.

15
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,850
It's because the ending is almost near. They
must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Don't worry too much about it, Writer.
You're going to give them a good ending.

17
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,540
A good ending?

18
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,510
Our company's employees are all looking forward to it, too.

19
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,990
Since you're not giving them any hints, they're
all in suspense wondering what the ending will be.

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,830
What will the ending be? I'm curious about that,
too! Won't you let me know what the ending will be?!

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,050
Cooking cell told me to bring this to you so you can gain some strength.

22
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,780
Bye!

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,620
The ending is coming.
<i>God Yumi! Let's have a legendary ending!!</i>

24
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,720
<i>Although you get the full support of everyone once you
become the top priority, it's not necessarily a good thing.</i>

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh, no. What should she do?

26
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,350
She has to end it well.

27
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,240
What should she do if it doesn't go well?

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,900
- What if Yumi can't give a good ending?
- Stop it!

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,850
They said they're looking forward to a good ending.

30
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,070
If it's not a good ending, won't Yumi be ostracized?

31
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,420
I said stop it, please!

32
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,850
<i>This cell is always clinging on to the Prime Cell. Anxiety.</i>

33
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,330
If this doesn't go well, it's all over! We
used all the down payment to buy the house.

34
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,130
We got a huge loan!

35
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,930
If things go badly, how will we pay back the loan?

36
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,080
What to do? What will we do? What will we do?!

37
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,890
I said stop it!

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,620
I'm so anxious that I can't write!

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,130
You'll send me the manuscript tomorrow
morning before the wedding, right?

40
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,990
Ah, I should.

41
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,540
Miss Writer, fighting! I'll see you at the ceremonial hall.

42
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, fighting!

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,650
<i>Yumi was already pretty stressed because
she had to finish the manuscript for the sequel.</i>

44
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,900
<i>But the real incident occured the night before Yi Da's wedding.</i>

45
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,590
Reason! Emergency, emergency!

46
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,990
- What is it?
- I don't see the laptop!

47
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,180
Look for it. It must be somewhere.

48
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,430
It's not there!

49
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,090
<i>It's not in the place where she usually charges it?</i>

50
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,980
<i>No, it's not.</i>

51
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,700
<i>Then what about the table?</i>

52
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,330
<i>What about under the bed?</i>

53
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,590
<i>It's not there!</i>

54
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,310
<i>Maybe she put it in another bag before she left?</i>

55
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>No!</i>

56
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,630
<i>Did it get mixed in with the recyclables?</i>

57
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,920
<i>I'm telling you it didn't!</i>

58
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,220
It's not here. It's gone.

59
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,700
How much of the manuscript is in the laptop?

60
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,060
Including the episode that I'm going to
upload tomorrow, it's 60 chapters in 6 episodes.

61
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,650
That much?! You didn't make a backup?

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,160
She definitely left it somewhere outside before she came home.

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,470
What places did she visit today?

64
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,420
<i>It's because the ending is almost near. They
must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.</i>

65
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,260
<i>There! She had the laptop up until then.</i>

66
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,360
Yes, Miss Writer?

67
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,270
- Your laptop?
- Yes.

68
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,750
We were looking at my laptop together
this morning and talking about the comments.

69
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,660
That was my laptop, though.

70
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,250
You didn't take your laptop out.

71
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,290
Did you lose it? <i>How?</i>

72
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,490
Yes, well...

73
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,510
I should look for it. I'll find it.

74
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,520
<i>You backed it up, right? As long as the manuscript is alright...</i>

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,960
Oh, of course!

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,820
Yes.

77
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
She must have really lost it.

78
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,340
Let's not despair!

79
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,770
For now, she can just go buy a new laptop tomorrow and rewrite it all!

80
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,580
Rewrite it all? 60 pages?!

81
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,300
Don't you have the outline in your head?

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,890
<i>In the end, Yumi couldn't find the
laptop up to the morning of the wedding.</i>

83
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,280
What will she do now? Everyone from the
publishing company is going to the wedding.

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,220
What will she do? What to do? Come up with an excuse.

85
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,210
There's no manuscript to upload today,

86
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,060
and there's no manuscript to upload next week
either. Even if she writes, there are malicious comments.

87
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,690
What do we do? They won't leaveâ

88
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm not being the prime cell anymore.

89
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,210
Bye, guys.

90
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,420
Don't look for me ever again!

91
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,850
Goodbye!

92
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,890
- Writer!
- Oh, no!

93
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,830
<i>Writer abandoned her prime cell position and ran away.</i>

94
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,620
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

95
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,490
Thank you.

96
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,050
Aigo, Writer Yumi! You made it?

97
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,060
Editor-in-Chief. Congratulations.

98
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,950
Thank you.

99
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,020
- Where's Yi Da?
- She's in the waiting room right now.

100
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,990
You finished by the deadline before you came, right?

101
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,730
- Yes.
- I'll read it after the ceremony.

102
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm looking forward to the last chapter.

103
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,540
Yes.

104
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, yes. Excuse me.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,490
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

106
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,260
<i>The groom's side</i>

107
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,670
<i>Kim Yumi</i>

108
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,700
Wow, Miss Yumi!

109
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,930
Oh, Bon Hui! Hello!

110
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,820
- It's been a long time. It's been so long!
- I know!

111
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,890
It's good to see you.

112
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,530
Wait, I heard that you're the one who set up the bride and groom.

113
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,200
They said that the groom is your editor-in-chief.

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,210
I didn't set them up.

115
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,360
<i>Really? He was a loser this time, too?</i>

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,450
<i>Yeah. He was the worst of the worst.</i>

117
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,250
<i>It's not like I'm betting on who's worse.</i>

118
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,790
<i>- Hey, I really got angry andâ
- Miss Writer.</i>

119
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,490
<i>Oh, Editor-in-Chief?</i>

120
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,450
<i>I saw you on my way to the publishing company.</i>

121
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,720
<i>Oh, I had plans with my friend, so...</i>

122
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,670
<i>I was just about to get up and leave anyway.</i>

123
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,350
<i>Yi Da, say hello. This is my
Editor-in-Chief. I talked about him a lot, right?</i>

124
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,360
<i>This is my former co-worker, Yi Da.</i>

125
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,210
<i>Hello, I'm Kang Yi Da.</i>

126
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,580
<i>Hello. I'm Ahn Dae Yong.</i>

127
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,590
<i>- You're the best!
- Pardon?</i>

128
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,460
<i>You're the person that chose our Yumi's work.</i>

129
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,100
<i>I always told Yumi that you've got a great eye..</i>

130
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,320
<i>You've really got an amazing eye for writers.</i>

131
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,080
<i>That's because Miss Writer's writing isâ</i>

132
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,420
<i>You're the best! Really the best!</i>

133
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,420
<i>What is this? Who is that cute creature?</i>

134
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,000
<i>She said she's Kang Yi Da.</i>

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,660
<i>Let's save that. Kang Yi Da.
[Kang Yi Da]</i>

136
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>Her name is Kang Yi Da.</i>

137
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,380
<i>Cute Best (Jjang) Yi Da.</i>

138
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,040
<i>The line is perfect, too!</i>

139
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,060
<i>- Hello!
- Hello.</i>

140
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,580
<i>Hello, I'm Ahn Dae Yong who greeted
you last time. You remember me, right?</i>

141
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,150
<i>Oh, this ahjusshi?</i>

142
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,200
<i>Yes, of course. Hello, how have you been?</i>

143
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,010
<i>I have a meeting nearby today.</i>

144
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,460
<i>If it's okay with you, shall we have lunch together?</i>

145
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,510
<i>Julie Literature Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong</i>

146
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,280
<i>Yes, that sounds good.</i>

147
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,670
<i>What's with this ahjusshi? It doesn't suit him to leave an emoticon.</i>

148
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,420
<i>He's cute.</i>

149
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,870
I only introduced them to each other. I found out later
that they were dating each other without me knowing.

150
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,530
What's with that? Oh, you also set Ruby up with her boyfriend.

151
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,630
I also only introduced Ruby to him,
and they started dating on their own.

152
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,190
Then I should stick by you from now on if I'm going to get married.

153
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,310
Oh right! We're catching up and forgot we
haven't even given our congratulatory money yet.

154
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,540
I'm in charge of giving them the envelopes from the marketing team.

155
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,490
<i>Yu Ba Bi</i>

156
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,860
Team Leader Yu can't come, so he put me in charge of it.

157
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,090
Ah...

158
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,550
Do you know that he's going to an overseas branch?

159
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,140
- An overseas branch?
- Yes, he was assigned to Singapore.

160
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,100
He said he couldn't come because he's leaving
today. So he asked me to bring the envelopes.

161
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,610
<i>What's this? This is ridiculous.</i>

162
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,150
Writer Cell ran away, and Love isn't here.

163
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,330
Is there a cell village without a prime cell?

164
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,150
- Reason.
- Huh?

165
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,080
Is our Yumi really living well right now?

166
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,090
The wedding was broken off, and she's missing the deadline.

167
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,920
Hey, you can't be like that. Today is Yi Da's
wedding ceremony. Let's not ruin the mood.

168
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,890
I'm saying that I'm sad. Everyone else gets married so easily.

169
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,520
- Is there anything else?
- No, that's everything.

170
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,600
I just left. I'll call you when I get to the airport.

171
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,190
Okay.

172
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,960
Hello?

173
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,340
<i>- This is the cafÃ© at the Baekseok-dong intersection.
</i>- Oh, yes.

174
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,390
Hello.

175
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm calling the number that was left on the coupon.

176
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,080
Ah, yes. What is it?

177
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,690
She's a writer. I thought she would be looking for it.

178
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,900
Yes, that's right. She would be looking for it.

179
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,730
I'm glad that I had your phone number.

180
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,410
Yes, thank you.

181
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
She must be at the wedding right now.

182
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,010
Is it okay to head to the airport now?

183
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,780
Oh, yes.

184
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,660
No, wait! One moment. I've got to stop somewhere.

185
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,990
<i>This is my first request.</i>

186
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,320
<i>More than anything else, please be considerate of each other.</i>

187
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,920
In the passion absorbed by each other's charms, the other's strengths

188
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,360
make you happy...

189
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,140
Are they going to give us steak?

190
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,850
Or galbitang?

191
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,230
I want to eat steak.

192
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,790
- Oppa.
- Hm?

193
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,120
By the way, isn't that woman in the pink
dress pretty? The one on the bride's side?

194
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,070
- You're way prettier, Ruby.
- What are you saying? That's obvious.

195
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,880
Did I say something too obvious?

196
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,100
Hey.

197
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,340
Shh.

198
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,280
Let's listen courteously to the good words.

199
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,360
- Yes, sir.
<i>- The husband has to love his wife</i>

200
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,140
<i>and the wife has to love her husband in order to become a true family.</i>

201
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,080
<i>Alright, everyone. Listen up!</i>

202
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,150
Writer has run away.

203
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,480
We are in a bind. There is no place to retreat to.

204
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,650
Yumi couldn't meet the deadline today, and
she lost the manuscript for the next three weeks.

205
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,970
She doesn't even have any idea about her story's ending.

206
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,580
- Oh, no.
- What should she do?

207
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,290
All that she has left is a missed deadline, malicious comments,

208
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,840
and the interest on her loan.

209
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,150
So today's strategy...

210
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,130
the thirty-six strategy!
<i>(Thirty-Six Strategems: "If all else fails, retreat.")</i>

211
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,220
- Is that a strategy?
- Thirty-six?

212
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,210
As soon as the ceremony ends, Yumi will leave the ceremony hall,

213
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,620
turn her phone off, and go to Mom's house.
- What?

214
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,730
And she'll disappear!

215
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,820
Until when? Until Writer comes back and she comes up with a plan!

216
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:20,050
That's the only way that Writer Kim Yumi will live today!

217
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,000
<i>What makes love complete isn't passion...</i>

218
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,340
<i>Oh, wait! It's Ba Bi. It's Ba Bi!</i>

219
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,040
<i>Love is...</i>

220
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,950
<i>Yumi. How are you?</i>

221
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,870
<i>You're probably attending the wedding right now.</i>

222
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,850
<i>I was contacted because you left your laptop at the cafe.</i>

223
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,440
<i>I came to get it so I could bring it to the wedding,</i>

224
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,850
<i>but I don't think I can make it because traffic is so backed up.</i>

225
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,130
What time did you say your flight was?

226
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,850
<i>I'm leaving for Singapore today, you see.</i>

227

232

233
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,410
<i>but I left your laptop in the airport locker.</i>

234
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,690
<i>I was trying to help you, but I ended up inconveniencing you. I'm sorry.</i>

237
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,860

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,860
You saved me.

302
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,980
My entire manuscript was in here. Thank you.

303
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,900
When will you finish the book?

304
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,570
The end of the year? If it goes well, around Christmas.

305
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,750
Oh, I see.

306
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,370
Finish it well.

307
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,110
I want to, but I'm not skilled enough.

308
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,190
You'll do well.

309
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,380
What about a boyfriend?

310
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,600
Did you get a boyfriend?

311
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,340
- No. I don't have time to.
- Really?

312
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,860
<i>Whats this?</i>

313
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,620
<i>Why is he smiling? What does that mean?</i>

314
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,040
Ba Bi really

315
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,440
makes my heart flutter!

316
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,520
Hey, hey! Are you guys starting up again?

317
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,550
Is this the first or second time? Knock it off!

318
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,360
Ba Bi always speak sweetly.

319
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,060
We know, we know.

320
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,910
You?

321
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,850
- Me?
- Do you have a girlfriend?

322
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,490
I am seeing someone.

323
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,050
- What's this?
- Look at that. You heard him, right?

324
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,780
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I know. I said I know!

325
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,920
Did I say anything?

326
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,850
I see. I hope it goes well.

327
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,440
Team Leader Ba Bi.

328
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,480
We have to go in now.

329
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,430
Oh, really?

330
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,970
I'll head in.

331
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,210
Okay. Have a good trip.

332
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,560
Bye.

333
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,870
By the way, is that woman from earlier your girlfriend?

334
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,780
Oh, no.

335
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,690
For some reason, the mood seemed to be a bit...

336
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,640
She's my ex-girlfriend.

337
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,160
What about now?

338
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,720
It's been a while since we broke up.

339
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,060
Then why was she at the airport?

340
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,570
Things ended up that way coincidentally.

341
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,550
It was as if she was a girlfriend coming to see me off, right?

342
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,040
But, Team Leader. Why won't you go on any blind dates?

343
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,660
I've recommended several women, but you said you weren't going on any.

344
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,280
- Because I don't want to.
- Why?

345
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,450
Why are you smiling?

346
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,770
Why aren't you going on any?

347
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,550
I'm not sure.

348
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,810
I don't really know why, either.

349

<i>Episode 40
The Return</i>

350
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,290
<i>Love disappeared one year ago on Christmas Eve.</i>

â« <i>I didn't hear anything

353
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,530
<i>This damned love affair! I'm telling you it's exasperating!</i>

354
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,540
<i>Love changed into the incarnation of rage.</i>

355
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,090
<i>Love.</i>

356
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:23,590
<i>Give the prime cell position to Writer.</i>

â« <i>Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person</i> â«

359

<i>The day that she got kicked out of her position as prime cell,</i>

360
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,220
<i>Love was banished to another dimension.</i>

361
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:52,180
<i>Even when we met Wung as if it were fate,</i>

<i>and when we got back together with Ba Bi,</i>

366
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:16,140
<i>Let's get married.</i>

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,610
<i>Even when she was proposed to...</i>

<i>All that time...</i>

369
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:28,440
<i>I've been thinking about it a lot...</i>

370
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,610
<i>I think I know what you're going to say.</i>

371
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,780
<i>Even when we were breaking up, Love didn't come back.</i>

372
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,290
- I'm better at that.
- Wait, why?

373
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,670
<i>Of course, it's not like there was never
a time when her heart fluttered after that.</i>

374
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,350
Writer Kim!

Ah, Oppa!

376
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,420
Mr. Yeon Il?

377
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Oh, my friend said he wanted to greet you
before he left. Say hello, Yeon Il. This is Writer Yumi.

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,150
Hello.

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,760
Ah, hello.

380
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm really enjoying My Love Muse.

Thank you.

382
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,360
- It's Love! Love is here!
- She said Love is here!

So she's finally back!

<i>There are a lot of cases where it's not.</i>

It's Curiosity. It's Curiousity!

388
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,140
What is it? Why are you acting like that?

389
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,260
- You guys were all fooled.
- So annoying.

Love has really come back!

Handsome men are not guilty.

Where's Love?

398

It's not her!

400
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,930
It was Sensitivity.

- What the heck?
- Man, I'm pissed off.

Ah. Thank you.

Really, really, my heart just dropped.

Is it real this time? This time it's love!

Guys, that guy, isn't he so sexy?

<i>But these days Yumi can't be fooled.</i>

Are you falling in love?

It's not like that.

That's suspicious.
- I told you that's not what it is.

Okay.

We have finally arrived on a new land.

If we go there then there is lesser chances to get kicked out.

On top of that, a lot of our Fat siblings already live there.

Reason, how about we clean the room before we write?

Wait, are you crazy?!

454

Why are you trying to do things you
don't normally do during her deadline?

I really want to know where.

Let's try looking it up.

<i>When you get deadline syndrome,</i>

463

<i>everything except the deadline becomes interesting.</i>

464
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,280
Where is this?

465
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,350
â« <i>There is a world I don't know</i> â«

Shall I wash the blankets in the village, too?

474
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,620
Stop it!

475
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,550
I'm going crazy.

476
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,180
Why are the last five chapters so hard?

<i>Eonni, when are you done?</i>

I don't know. I don't have a plan.

481
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,140
I think I'm going to be cancelled.

<i>What do you mean, cancelled?</i>

483

<i>We all got a party together and are waiting for you!</i>

484
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,100
A party?

485
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,530
We're waiting to congratulate you for finishing your novel.

486
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,570
<i>First thing in the morning?</i>

487
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,920
We're going to start now. It's planned for the fifth.

488
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,270
Hurry up and come.

489
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:30,680
Miss Writer, the side dishes and beer
here are seriously killer! Hurry up and come!

490
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,350
Eonni Yi Da said she's coming right after her honeymoon trip, too.

491
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,710
Are you going to sit in the corner of
your room writing alone on Christmas Eve?

492
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,560
Eonni, do you really want to live like that?

493
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,680
No.

494
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,910
So get dressed and hurry up.

495
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,970
A party?

496
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,480
That sounds good.

497
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,040
What?

498
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,600
I just thought of something.

499
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,880
If I make the ending happen at a year-end party...

500
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,900
Eonni, I can't hear you very well.

501
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,150
Ah, that's right! That's it!

502
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,190
They meet each other for the first time there.

503
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,130
Coincidentally, at the year-end party.

504
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,770
They can't talk to each other at all because the music is so loud.

505
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,320
What? What are you talking about?

506
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,370
Okay, I'm hanging up!

507
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,160
That's right.
â« <i>Are you paying attention to me?</i> â«

508
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,740
They met there for the first time.
â« <i>Or is it meaningless?</i> â«

509
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,110
â« <i>Do our eyes keep meeting?</i> â«

510
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,460
â« <i>Or were you just looking at something behind me?</i> â«

511
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,490
That day was Christmas Eve.

512
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,780
Yeon Jae ends up going to the year-end party thrown by her company,

513
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,640
and ends up meeting him as if it's fated.
â« <i>I'm going to continue to hide it</i> â«

514
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,520
â« <i>so you won't know how I feel</i> â«

515
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,550
But because the music is too loud,

516
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,110
she can't hear him when he tells her his name.

517
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,280
But he remembered Yeon Jae's name.

518
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,450
Like a miracle.

519
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,490
<i>When her writer's block suddenly clears,</i>

520
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,720
<i>it's extremely thrilling.</i>

521
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,450
<i>It's none other than Endorphin Time.</i>

522
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,650
Yeah!!!
<i>Endorphin</i>

<i>It's been a year since she became a writer. During
that time, Yumi wrote two novels, My Love Muse</i>

<i>and it's sequel.</i>

<i>The cell village is also busy at the end of the year.</i>

<i>After the Endorphin concert, there's a year-end awards ceremony.</i>

End of the year closing.

The Most Improved Cell Award for Yumi's
cells that showed the most growth this year.

554
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,360
It can't be any other cell but me. Why are you acting
as if you don't know when you do? So embarrassing.

555
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,410
The Best Cell Award!

556
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,020

- Huh?
- What?

566
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,170
I can't believe this, seriously!

567
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,050
As Babi's cells are currently employed overseas,

568
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,720
they can't attend the award ceremony,

569

so I will accept in theirâ

I'm the one who made Yumi a writer!

571
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,090
And I made the first and second books a success!

572
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,600
You should be giving that award to me!

573

What kind of bulls**t is this!

574
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,090
Let me go!

575
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,890
Writer, calm down.

576
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,660
You are the one who wrote the books,
but Ba Bi was the one who saved you.

577
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,640
What? Ba Bi saved me?

578
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,250

<i>I think you'll do a good job.</i>

580
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,710
The first one to recognize our talent was Ba Bi.

581
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,330
The one who always supported us was also Ba Bi.

â« <i>My dear,</i> â«

<i>Once she finished the book, there was something she had to do first.</i>

Oh! You saw?

604
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,950
I heard you lost yours. I thought you would need one right away.

<i>It's your equipment.</i>

No... Wung, I'm grateful...

But I found my laptop.

Oh, really? That's great.

609

So I will send this back.

That's okay. Just use it.

That's the newest model so it has the best specs.

No. Why would you buy me a laptop?

Why? I could give it as a gift.

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,760
So that you would write nice things.

615
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,840
No, this is really not right. I will send it back.

616
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,730
If you send it back then I will send you another one.

617
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,500
What?

618
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,860
And if you send it again then I will send one again and again.

619
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,980
Come on, what kind of stubbornness is that?

620
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,680
I have a call coming in.

621
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,810
Talk to you later.

622
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,400
Hello? Wung?

623
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,540
<i>So she went to return it personally.</i>

624
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,490
Hey, Yumi!

625
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,600
Aren't you Yumi?

626
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,680
Louis, it's been a long time.

627
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,990
Totally a long time.

628
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,510
What brings you here?

629
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,150
Come in.

630
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,150
I can wait in the lobby though.

631
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,040
What are you saying.

632
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,040
If ever I let you wait in the lobby

633
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,310
then Wung, that punk

634
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:24,170
no, I mean CEO Gu would kill me.

635
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,650
It's about time for the meeting to be
over so if you could just wait for a moment.

636
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,250
Yes.

637
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,000
Please be comfortable.

638
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,350
That... can I ask for your signature later?

639
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,170
Signature?

640
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,130
Yes. My girlfriend is a fan of your piece My Love Muse.

641
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,040
Yes.

642
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,960
Then I will bring you a paper later on.

643
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,970
- Please be comfortable.
- Yes.

644
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,570
How cool.

645
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,570
Gu Wung has really succeeded.

646
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,770
<i>CEO Gu WUng.</i>

647
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,780
<i>Wait. I think I have seen this name a lot.</i>

648
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,800
Storm Man. UlaUla.

649
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,400
My love muse

650
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,290
Walwal*
<i>(To be quick.)</i>

651
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,640
<i>So much fun! Most fun in the world!</i>

652
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,200
<i>I keep on waiting for Monday!</i>

653
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,090
<i>The writer is so great! Hope she succeeds!</i>

654
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,540
<i>She keeps playing with her readers! Daebak!</i>

655
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,790
- Kim Yumi is the best!
- Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript!

656
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,600
<i>My love muse is the best!</i>

657
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,200
<i>Writer Kim Yumi is the best!</i>

658
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,590
<i>That's right.</i>

659
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,130
<i>The nicknames that kept on posting praises every morning.</i>

660
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,940
<i>All this time, Wung was the one who posted those?</i>

661
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,810
â« <i>Even if I don't extend my hand the feeling of warmth</i> â«

662
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,800
He didn't even miss once, for a year.

663
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,930
How could this be? I got so much strength from all those comments.

664
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:23,040
This is really so Wung.

665
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,730
Gu Wung! Gu Wung! Gu Wung!

666
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,580
Gu Wung! Gu Wung! Gu Wung!

667
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,040
Gu Wung! Gu Wung!

668
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,340
I have an emergent suggestion.

669
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,700
Let's add one more cell award for this year.

670
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,680
As a co-Yumi award!

671

677
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,200
Yumi!

678
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,180
Sir!

679
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,740
Are you okay?

680
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,230
I'm okay.

681
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,650
Are you really okay?

682
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,840
I'm fine so you can go do your work.

683
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,870
Your slippers.

684
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,830
Thank you!

685
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,240
Are you really okay?
- I am totally fine.

686
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,230
Even if you have become the CEO, you haven't changed.

687
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,350
But what brings you here? I was so surprised to hear you came.

688
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,160
I came to bring the laptop.

689
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,750
I told you I won't take it back.

690
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,560
I also earn money well these days.

691
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,400
Also, I'm very thankful

692
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,210
so I can't accept this. I also have a conscience.

693
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,540
What are you so thankful for?

694
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,160
There's this thing.

695
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,550
I am really moved, Wung.

696
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,520
Let's eat lunch together. I will be done in thirty minutes.

697
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,010
I need to go.

698
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,460
Where?
- I just dropped by because it was on my way.

699
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,170
I will get going.

700
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,910
Can't I go too?

701
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,560
It's a gathering for the publisher.

702
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,520
I know Control Z too.

703
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,520
Later. Let's eat together.

704
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,460
It's my treat.

705
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,880
Why?
- Because I'm thankful.

706
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,460
Merry Christmas, Wung.

707

<i>Even though a breakup is the end for love</i>

713
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,870
<i>I realized these days that a breakup does
not mean the end to a connection to someone.</i>

714
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,150
Yumi!

715

A few days ago.

When I opened my eyes, I was back.

782
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,250
I'm late because I had to walk back from the desert.

783
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,040
I couldn't fly because I'm not the prime cell.

784

Anyway, it's good to see you, even though I don't know how you got back.
