goodbye to the past?</i>

00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,058
<i>Haunting you.</i>

7
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:23,500
I would like to speak
with Olivia alone.

8
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:28,587
You do not get to make requests
after breaking our agreement.

9
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:34,344
Knocking on my door,
threatening to wake my family.

10
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,836
You do not get to see
my daughter,

11
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,888
Not tonight, not ever.

12
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,340
You must believe me,

13
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:41,992
I am not here to exhume
our past.

14
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,660
I am here to put it
to rest.

15
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:44,937
Well then why come at all?

16
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,775
Because I have cancer.

17
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,933
And Christopher...

18
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,011
He's in medical school now.

19
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:04,197
Can you believe it,
my son the doctor.

20
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,199
You must realize how dire
things are for me

21
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,953
To be on your doorstep.

22
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,295
I have little time left

23
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:13,216
And even less of the inheritance
garland left me.

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,542
It was all lost
in the crash.

25
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,471
And when I'm gone, Christopher
will have nowhere to go.

26
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,531
No means to finish
his schooling,

27
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,384
No other family
to support him.

28
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:27,896
I gave you my daughter
by choice.

29
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,710
Tonight I am asking you
to take my son.

30
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:35,320
<i>I had followed
my instincts</i>

31
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,781
<i>But that had led straight
to mal's death.</i>

32
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,975
Olivia, please.

33
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,736
<i>And so it began.</i>

34
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:46,331
<i>For one dark year I pushed back
against my instincts.</i>

35
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,792
This is Malcolm's decision
to make.

36
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,132
<i>And learn to follow
Malcolm's instead.</i>

37
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,739
Nothing will be free
for him here.

38
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,475
He will have to work
for his education.

39
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,777
But I don't need
a tutor, daddy.

40
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,353
I just want to go back to school
and see my friends.

41
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:16,437
Sit.

42
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,991
<i>I became an observer
in my own home.</i>

43
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,355
<i>None of this goddamn
piano music!</i>

44
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,292
You know what I want
for Christmas?!

45
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,601
Silence!

46
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:33,688
<i>I told myself that I did it for the safety
of my children.</i>

47
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,721
<i>...In here,
day in and day out.</i>

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,810
Alicia has died.

49
00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,977
<i>I thought that as long
as I obeyed Malcolm...</i>

50
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,051
Where do you think Christopher
would like

51
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,719
This picture of his parents?

52
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:07,739
<i>One thing could
remain certain.</i>

53
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:12,004
<i>That what happened to mal would
never happen again in my home.</i>

54
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,321
Mother?

55
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,399
I thought perhaps
I could ride my horse

56
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,733
Into town this afternoon.

57
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,402
If this is about your debutante
ball dress,

58
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,328
I already have appointments
set for seamstresses

59
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,347
To come to the house
next week.

60
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,241
Then shouldn't I know what
the latest fashions are

61
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,592
Before they arrive?

62
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,095
You can't keep me locked up
in this house forever.

63
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,859
It's up to your father.

64
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,687
Daddy...

65
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,539
With my debutante ball
coming up

66
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,450
I really need to have the best
dress, don't you think?

67
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,377
Well, only the best
for my daughter

68
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,881
On the night she introduces
herself to virginian society.

69
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,217
So, maybe you could give me
the key to the swan room

70
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,052
And I could have a look through
grandmother's old things

71
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,268
For some inspiration.

72
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:10,118
Why don't you visit the shops
in town instead?

73
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,711
I don't know, daddy.

74
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,788
It just doesn't sound very fun
to go all the way there

75
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,124
And look at all those
tantalizing things

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,477
And not have any means to bring
any of them home.

77
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,993
Well, what is to be done
about that, hmm?

78
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,927
I guess I could ask Joel
to stop playing his piano

79
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,595
For a bit and take me.

80
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,518
Wouldn't that be a gift
to us all.

81
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,345
I've already lost my closest
friendships from school

82
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,514
Since no one writes anymore.

83
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,699
When they show up to my ball,
if they even do,

84
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,034
I'll be a complete stranger.

85
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,869
How am I going to have
any fun?

86
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,704
Well, hopefully this Christopher
fellow coming to stay

87
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,706
Will make father look up.

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,949
It's easy for you to see
the positives.

89
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,619
They actually let you leave
for school

90
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,379
And get away with a life
full of secret dalliances

91
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,714
While I'm stuck at home

92
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,533
Listening to the world
on the radio.

93
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:34,230
No, that's just because
since mal died.

94
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,873
Well, father's the only one
making decisions these days

95
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:41,709
And he doesn't give a fig
what happens to me.

96
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:43,711
And it's dalliance.

97
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,322
Singular.

98
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,215
You're cruel.

99
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,662
Why won't you tell me
about her?

100
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:53,830
This is more fun.

101
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,914
Just tell me this.

102
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,657
Is it because I know her?

103
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,352
You can keep trying but you're
not getting anything out of me.

104
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,017
Mrs. Steiner.
Good afternoon.

105
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,503
Why Mr. Joel foxworth.

106
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:21,504
All grown up and pretty
as a peacock.

107
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,223
If you'll excuse me,

108
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,587
some of us don't have time
to dawdle in the streets

109
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:29,785
Contributing absolutely nothing
to the workforce.

110
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:38,190
And who was that bucket
of joy?

111
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,543
A bucket and a mop
full of joy.

112
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,121
She used to be our housekeeper,
Mrs. Steiner.

113
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,216
Mother fired her
before you were born.

114
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,126
Mal always told me how much
he hated her.

115
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,553
Hmm, I can't imagine why.

116
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,056
Do you want to come with me
and help pick out a dress?

117
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,811
Tempting, but I have
my own shopping to do.

118
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:10,648
Oh, miss foxworth,
your stockings.

119
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,133
Ugh.

120
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,226
Just another thing falling apart
in my world.

121
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,970
Do you have any
for purchase?

122
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:18,084
Well, only paint on.

123
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,939
Looking for something?

124
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,925
Not anymore.

125
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,853
Sir, I'm helping
the young lady.

126
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:50,866
That's quite all right.

127
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,176
The top button seems
to have caught

128
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,437
As I was unloading my luggage
on the train.

129
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,623
Normally I wouldn't mind
being one button short,

130
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,461
But first impressions
being what they are.

131
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,539
If the lady will allow, I can
mend it in just a moment.

132
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,858
Go right ahead.

133
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,555
And take your time.

134
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,721
We seem to have stumbled upon
each other indisposed, miss.

135
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:28,818
And exposed, sir.

136
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,713
I'll forgive your bad impression
if you forgive mine.

137
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:32,968
Deal.

138
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,828
Those were my last silk pair.

139
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,555
Were?

140
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,390
They ripped.

141
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,483
I guess I am to become
one of the many women

142
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,669
Parading about town
with painted seams

143
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,154
On the back of
their bare legs.

144
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:54,010
It's unladylike
and uncomfortable.

145
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,161
Well, I may not be able to
soothe the issue of comfort

146
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:57,680
But I can assure you
that no gentleman

147
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,394
Will be staring
at your legs.

148
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:06,525
So, you're saying
you're no gentleman?

149
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,286
Thank you.

150
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,878
I'm forever in your debt.

151
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:33,383
Better watch out.
I might keep you to that.

152
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:41,934
There you are. I have
a present for you,

153
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,123
So you know what time it is
to come to see me.

154
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:53,037
But I like listening
for your music.

155
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:56,132
It reminds me of when nella
used to sing to me at night.

156
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:00,222
You can still listen with a very
handsome watch on your arm.

157
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,366
You sure this isn't just some
way to hold me over longer?

158
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,459
You know my father.

159
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,795
There's no way I'm getting
my trust till I turn 25.

160
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,372
I don't need some
rich man's fortune

161
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:14,709
Making me wait to go see
the world.

162
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,153
I'll go out
and grab it myself.

163
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,304
Okay.

164
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,491
Where is it you truly
want to go?

165
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,493
North.

166
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:28,331
What does that mean?

167
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,894
New York? Chicago?

168
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:35,413
Nova Scotia?

169
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:39,658
You can't just traipse the globe
without any direction.

170
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:43,662
I'll be happy anywhere
without automobiles to work on.

171
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,924
Anywhere I can make
my own decisions,

172
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:50,002
Just anywhere but here.

173
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,430
Traveling costs money.

174
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,916
I can take odd jobs.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,860
You can always play your music
for money.

176
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,105
Everyone needs music.

177
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,925
I can't take my piano
with me.

178
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,277
There's plenty of places
got pianos

179
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:10,039
And you're plenty pretty
to get a job playing on them.

180
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,877
Aren't you kind.

181
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:29,645
Would you please quit
that racket?!!

182
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,783
Go, go, go.

183
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,822
I told you all that piano
playing would make him soft.

184
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,398
What are you talking about?

185
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,586
I found that negro garage boy

186
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,071
Doing improper things
to your son.

187
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,572
Oh my god,
is he hurt?

188
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,012
Worse. He was enjoying it.

189
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,340
I'll talk to him.

190
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,604
I will take care of it.
You've already done enough.

191
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,336
Hey, hey, what's going on?

192
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,840
Hey! Hey!

193
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:26,616
<i>What's happening?</i>

194
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,510
No! You gotta have
a reason!

195
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:33,514
- Just tell us why!
- Mom, they're hurting him.

196
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,774
You can't just break
in our home!

197
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,627
You get your hands off
my boy.

198
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,021
- You gotta have a reason!
- Mom, where are they taking him?

199
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,446
Get off him!

200
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,303
Let's go. Get in the truck.
We'll follow them!

201
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,060
Come on, come on!
Get in, get in!

202
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,914
Oh, my god! Harry!

203
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,060
You get your hands off me!
Don't touch me!

204
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:23,818
<i>Get off me!</i>

205
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,594
Is this him?

206
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,408
That's him all right.
That's the thief.

207
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:36,335
I ain't no thief. I didn't
steal nothing.

208
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,021
You shut your month.
Not another word.

209
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,840
Our Harry,
he is no thief.

210
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,342
Then how do you explain
this spiffy little piece

211
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,114
On his wrist then?

212
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,771
Mrs. Foxworth,
you know our Harry

213
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,349
Would never steal
from anyone.

214
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,110
She can speak
to his character.

215
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,537
Please.

216
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,188
I don't think we know this boy
well enough

217
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:57,615
To speak to his character.

218
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:58,541
Oh, come on!

219
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,542
Samuel don't!

220
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,131
Mrs. Foxworth, please!

221
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,442
I didn't do anything!

222
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,443
Harry, stop moving.

223
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:10,294
No, no, no!

224
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,889
No!!!

225
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,392
No, Harry! Please no!

226
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,150
Harry!

227
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,548
Get inside.

228
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,162
Well done.

229
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:56,602
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

230
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,692
Does anyone want to tell me
what really happened last night?

231
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,455
Drop it, corrine.

232
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,708
I hate it here.

233
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,964
Mr. And Mrs. Foxworth.
Your guest has arrived.

234
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:37,559
Christopher.

235
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,874
Welcome back to foxworth hall.

236
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:51,406
Corrine, Joel, I'd like you
to meet your uncle Christopher.

237
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,332
Pleasure to finally meet you,
uncle Christopher.

238
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,408
Uh, yes.

239
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,088
Pleasure.

240
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:23,260
Christopher, we're delighted
to have you here.

241
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,274
Isn't that right?

242
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:28,277
Yes. Right.

243
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,031
Please excuse Joel's silence.

244
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,682
He often plays the piano
too late into the night

245
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:38,759
And tires himself.

246
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:41,428
He's a very dedicated musician.

247
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,430
Piano.

248
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,099
Something I've always wanted
to learn.

249
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:49,361
Actually, you already know how.
Or you did.

250
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:53,791
I taught you along with both
of the boys ages ago.

251
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,776
Well now...

252
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,220
So Joel, tell me.
Is it like muscle memory?

253
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,463
Will I immediately
become Beethoven

254
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:02,391
If I just return my fingers
to the keys?

255
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,479
Piano's not a bicycle.

256
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,307
I'm so grateful

257
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,626
That you're allowing me
to stay here with you.

258
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,478
Your charity in providing me
a home,

259
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:17,147
I can't thank you enough.

260
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,742
Is that what you think this is?

261
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,302
Charity?

262
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,578
Malcolm.

263
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,396
Of course not.

264
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,732
I hope you are prepared to work
in exchange for your tuition.

265
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,919
That is the arrangement
as I've understood it.

266
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,495
And I am more than happy
to serve your office

267
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,904
In any way it requires.

268
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,498
You will not be working
in the office.

269
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:39,014
You will be helping out with the
yard-work here at foxworth hall.

270
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,656
I'd be happy to, sir.

271
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,342
Daddy, surely you can't
expect him to work

272
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:48,345
Alongside nella's family
and the rest of the servants.

273
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,439
What's wrong with him working
alongside nella's family?

274
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,923
Joel.

275
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,259
You know mother?
You were right...

276
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,112
I didn't get much rest
last night.

277
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,824
Excuse me.

278
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,203
It's for the best.

279
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,206
I'm late for work.

280
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,171
Corrine darling, why don't you
show your uncle to his room?

281
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,374
I, um, haven't quite finished
my breakfast yet.

282
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,526
I can surely find it myself.

283
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,556
Come. I'll show you.

284
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,821
Taylard residence.
Rockford speaking.

285
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:01,068
Rock? It's corrine. Foxworth.

286
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:04,180
And to what do I owe
the pleasure?

287
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:09,000
How do you feel about
sneaking out this afternoon?

288
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,671
I must say I did not expect this
house to be quite what it is,

289
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,581
Or for you to be
who you are.

290
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,266
Oh?

291
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,862
Did your mother tell you
very much about her time here?

292
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,424
Almost nothing at all.

293
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,609
Is the piano the only instrument
I can play?

294
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:34,859
I can't believe you're
allowing this.

295
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,378
This isn't the place.

296
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,772
You have to know what the police
would do to a black man

297
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,442
They think stole from
a white man like father.

298
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:42,534
Keep your voice down.

299
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:45,295
How can I when Harry
could be dead?

300
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,282
You saw what they did to him in
full view on our own front lawn.

301
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:52,711
Just imagine what they're doing
to him in jail.

302
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,714
We have to do something.

303
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,901
This wasn't Harry's fault.

304
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:03,480
It's something we came to
together, willingly.

305
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:05,327
It's what we both want.

306
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,832
Where are you?

307
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:17,569
Someone you love
is pleading with you

308
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:21,906
That someone they love
is hurting.

309
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,485
You won't do anything.

310
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,972
Love?

311
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,686
This isn't up to me.
It's up to your father.

312
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:38,860
This is fine.
Don't go any further.

313
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,594
Thanks for giving me a way
out of the house.

314
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,114
That was the most exciting
afternoon I've had in weeks.

315
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,431
Yeah. Yep.

316
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,617
Movies always make me
feel better,

317
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,195
Except when you make me wait
through the whole thing.

318
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,626
I guess first year of business
school doesn't teach Patience.

319
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,870
Patience, no.

320
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:02,372
Persistence, yes.

321
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:07,861
I really do have to go.
I've been away for too long.

322
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:10,806
I'm real glad you called me
up, corrine.

323
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,727
See you soon.

324
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,309
Corrine.
What you doing?

325
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:35,722
Shh! It is none
of your business.

326
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,315
But will you please,
please don't mention

327
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,379
That you saw me to either
of my parents.

328
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,172
As long as you tell me
where you were.

329
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,427
Why do you care?

330
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,263
Just concerned
for my niece.

331
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:54,257
So, my father has you
working already?

332
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:56,668
Who am I to reject the call
of my new vocation?

333
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,336
It does look as though
you'll be needing

334
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,247
To pay another visit
to the seamstress.

335
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,692
Hey. Careful who you're
laughing at.

336
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,602
See, I was just about
to tell you

337
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,029
That your father's still
at the office

338
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,032
And your mother is getting
her dress fitted.

339
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,850
So, if you're looking
for a way to sneak in

340
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:15,095
You might try through
the kitchen.

341
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,948
But now maybe I won't
tell you that.

342
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,419
Thank you.

343
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:28,867
May I ask who this
is regarding?

344
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:31,306
Not if you want to keep
your practice.

345
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:39,814
And Curtis, make it the most
effective treatment available.

346
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:11,485
<i>Are you going to do
something about Harry?</i>

347
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,928
We are.

348
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,307
Good.

349
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,598
I'll come with you
to the station

350
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,250
And you can drop the charges
against him immediately.

351
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,178
You will be leaving
to spend some time

352
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:24,940
At a professional facility
in west more land.

353
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:29,778
Now you will say nothing
to your sister about this.

354
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:35,099
You will pack one bag and I will
take you tonight after dark

355
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,694
So nobody sees us.

356
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:43,867
Now the professionals there
will... Get it out of you.

357
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:48,964
And you will recover.
And then you will return.

358
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:55,787
And we will never speak
of this again.

359
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,288
What if I don't want to go?

360
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,975
That is not your decision
to make.

361
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,230
It's my life.

362
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,566
It is my name.

363
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,070
And you're on board
with this?

364
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,151
When are you going to tell me
what you want?!

365
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,705
I am aligned
with your father.

366
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:28,047
I'll go if you drop the charges
against Harry.

367
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,010
I know your father's plan
seems extreme.

368
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:54,437
Your plan.
It's your plan too.

369
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:57,366
You agreed to it.

370
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,594
If you go get it fixed then
your father wouldn't hurt you.

371
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:02,290
It's a little late for that.

372
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,960
Thank you for doing this.

373
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,631
I'm not doing this for you.

374
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,599
The least you could do is
give this to Harry for me.

375
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,658
- I was just heading...
- Getting a glass of water.

376
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:44,971
Because it's just so... Hot.

377
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:47,749
Yes, it is.

378
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,172
Exceptionally hot.

379
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:58,179
Well um... Goodnight.

380
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:05,019
- That's not my room.
- That's my room.

381
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:11,498
I will just go to
my actual room.

382
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:16,445
Which is apparently
right next door to yours.

383
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,278
Goodnight.

384
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,423
How did you sleep last night?

385
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,592
- I was a bit restless.
- Not well at all.

386
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,428
Of course. Sorry.

387
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,155
No, it's okay.

388
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:53,435
I slept just fine.
Thank you for asking.

389
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,770
Where's Joel?

390
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,438
He left for Montreal.

391
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,693
What?

392
00:30:58,582 --> 00:30:59,861
Montreal?

393
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:03,670
He received a telegram yesterday

394
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:06,114
Inviting him to study
with a top musician there,

395
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,343
But he had to leave right away
in order to accept.

396
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:12,862
This is ridiculous.
Why wouldn't he tell me?

397
00:31:12,946 --> 00:31:15,198
Who's the musician?

398
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,350
A composer at the philharmonic
there.

399
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:20,128
He was really very torn
about it.

400
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,705
He didn't want to upset you that
he'd be gone for the summer.

401
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,026
He's not going to be back
in time for my ball?

402
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,803
But he was supposed to be
my first dance.

403
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:33,308
Your ball will be just as good
without him.

404
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,854
Maybe better.

405
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,601
Miss foxworth.

406
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,004
Corrine, please.

407
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,068
Glad to see you're home.

408
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,741
I stopped reading when I
realized what they were.

409
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,621
Oh, it's all right.

410
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:44,862
I know you must be hurting.

411
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,531
I just want to know
where he is.

412
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,804
Did he tell you?

413
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:19,822
What do you know about a place
called west more land sanitarium?

414
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:23,234
Some physicians call
west more land experimental,

415
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:28,423
But experimental is too kind
of a word for a place like that.

416
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,511
What's happened?

417
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,015
Over here, if you would be
so kind.

418
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,076
Mrs. Foxworth.

419
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,268
Do you have a moment?
We need to speak to you.

420
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,344
It's important.

421
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,357
I know about Joel and Harry.

422
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,027
You may leave.

423
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,025
Just what are you
both imagining?

424
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,511
Forget imagination.

425
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,680
Any serious professional
will tell you

426
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:04,534
That westmoreland's methods
are extreme and unverified.

427
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:06,869
They have consequences.

428
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:09,613
The approach they're known
for uses shocks of electricity

429
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:13,042
In patients' brains for every
condition you can imagine,

430
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:17,138
From nervousness to venereal
disease to homo...

431
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,893
Homosexuality.

432
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:22,563
But it doesn't work.

433
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,069
Mother, please.

434
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,406
Joel needs you.

435
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,225
<i>I might have been
mourning mal</i>

436
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:47,393
<i>But I had closed the door
on my Joel</i>

437
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,337
<i>Because I couldn't face
what was inside.</i>

438
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,415
<i>But it was seeing him there,
what was left of him,</i>

439
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,567
<i>I remembered who I was.</i>

440
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,058
<i>His provider.</i>

441
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:04,105
<i>His protector.</i>

442
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:06,003
Ma'am?

443
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:07,004
<i>His parent.</i>

444
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:08,581
What are you doing?

445
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:10,841
Getting my son
out of this place.

446
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:13,239
Only your husband
can sign him out.

447
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,851
My husband doesn't need
to know anything about this.

448
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:24,625
I am his mother and I'm
taking him home.

449
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,435
Why do you think
they're taking so long?

450
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,632
Everything's going to be
all right.

451
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,367
If that place is what
I think it is,

452
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,932
As soon as your mother sees Joel
she'll know exactly what to do.

453
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,064
She's back.

454
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:06,581
It's Joel.

455
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,249
He's sick.

456
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,234
I can't take care of him
in the house.

457
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,587
Awful big house, though.

458
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,590
I know how heavy this is
for me to show up like this.

459
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,908
You don't know the first thing
about heavy.

460
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,095
I should have done
more than I did.

461
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,671
I wasn't myself.

462
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:24,265
But I'm working on
finding that person again,

463
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,935
And right now that person
is here at your door

464
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,023
Asking for your help.

465
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,335
I just want us all to sleep
better tonight.

466
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:38,095
You want us to help
your boy.

467
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:41,616
What work did you do
to help ours?

468
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,676
She got him back for us.

469
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,511
Beaten bad.

470
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:46,454
Alive.

471
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,957
No, I didn't.

472
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,185
I was too much of a coward.
That was Joel.

473
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:53,795
Joel brought your son
back to you.

474
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:58,886
So, if you won't do this for me,
would you do it for him?

475
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,626
Where's your boy?

476
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,371
He's laid out in the car.
I need a hand.

477
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:14,026
Malcolm can never know.

478
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:36,424
Oh, dear lord.

479
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:40,503
I'll take the legs.

480
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,279
What did you do to him?

481
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,965
Has anyone heard from Joel?

482
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,830
I'd just like to make sure
he arrived in Montreal safely.

483
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:57,252
I'm sure he has.
Isn't that right, Malcolm?

484
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,298
I should get to work.

485
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:04,011
As should I.

486
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,107
If you can't keep
this a secret...

487
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,258
He was barely conscious.

488
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:25,280
He needs to be in our home with
a real nurse or in a hospital.

489
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:28,702
Do you want your father
to put him through a window?

490
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:32,194
You let this happen.

491
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:33,529
You lied to me.

492
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:35,290
To protect you.

493
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,959
You have no idea what's gone on
in this house,

494
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,127
What I've done to shield you.

495
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,779
I have never asked
to be shielded!

496
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,689
When have you ever asked
what I wanted?!

497
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:46,192
Everything I've done
was for you.

498
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,180
And look at what we've lost.

499
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,247
I'm worried about corrine.

500
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,841
We had a fight.

501
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,753
She rode off on her horse
just before the storm hit.

502
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,572
I thought she'd be back
before dark.

503
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,101
What were you thinking?

504
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:49,922
<i>Search the entire estate!</i>

505
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:54,038
<i>That night, horrors
rained down on our home.</i>

506
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,947
<i>You, head out
to the lake.</i>

507
00:40:58,031 --> 00:41:00,266
<i>Let's get on with it.</i>

508
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,631
<i>No one rests until
we find my corrine.</i>

509
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,056
<i>Some we had
already imagined.</i>

510
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:28,614
<i>Some we had hidden
from view.</i>

511
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:44,338
<i>And others we couldn't
even dream of.</i>

512
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:59,353
<i>They would come
to haunt us later.</i>

513
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:05,848
<i>But in that moment
there was only silence.</i>

514
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:07,920
<i>My own.</i>

515
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,197
Corrine!

516
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,866
Corrine!

517
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,041
Harry?

518
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:24,002
<i>What did they do to you?</i>

519
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,633
Don't you worry about me.
I'll be all right.

520
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,711
I should have told the cops
I gave you the watch.

521
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:38,806
That would've made things worse
for the both of us.

522
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,728
Worse than this?

523
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:44,815
Look at us.

524
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,153
I miss your playing.

525
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,215
It'll come back.

526
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:58,217
What if it doesn't?

527
00:42:58,301 --> 00:42:59,472
Hey.

528
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,479
You just sleep now.

529
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,668
We'll worry about
all that later.

530
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,991
Corrine!

531
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,863
Corrine!

532
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,119
Corrine!

533
00:43:46,273 --> 00:43:47,878
Can you stand?

534
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,090
Where does it hurt?

535
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,051
My horse got spooked
and I fell off.

536
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,220
I need to look at the wound
but we're too far out.

537
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,963
We have to find shelter.

538
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:05,226
There's a chapel
just down that trail.

539
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,148
Okay, hold on.

540
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,339
If no one sees
the beacon outside,

541
00:44:43,423 --> 00:44:45,185
We'll have to sleep here.

542
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:52,181
I'm going to do
the best I can

543
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:54,500
But you'll have to be treated by
a doctor as soon as we get back.

544
00:44:54,584 --> 00:44:56,168
I thought you were a doctor.

545
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:57,781
A qualified trainee.

546
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,210
Relax.

547
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,338
Breathe.

548
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,953
Why don't you tell me how
you knew about this place?

549
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:25,622
I used to come here
with my brothers.

550
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,643
Are you trying
to distract me?

551
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,564
Is it working?

552
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,634
We used to race our horses all
the way from the house to here.

553
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:41,046
And who would win,
you or Joel?

554
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,701
Not Joel.

555
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,371
Mal.

556
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,832
Ever since he died

557
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,922
It's like we're not allowed
to talk about him anymore.

558
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:01,008
It's like we might break
if we do.

559
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,418
People don't truly break

560
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:04,765
If someone's there
to help them heal.

561
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,413
I'm done. You can relax.

562
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:23,346
So, the debt is paid.

563
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,109
I saved your shirt,
you saved my life.

564
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:30,779
Actually, you ruined
my shirt.

565
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:33,040
It's wrapped around
your leg.

566
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,768
So, I guess I owe you.

567
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:38,882
For some reason I still
feel like I owe you.

568
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:04,241
Corrine!

569
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,619
<i>Corrine!</i>

570
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,579
She's in here!

571
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:34,751
Oh, thank goodness.

572
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:36,678
Are you all right?
Can you walk?

573
00:47:36,762 --> 00:47:38,755
Put me down please, daddy.

574
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,016
Just a few scrapes.
She was lucky.

575
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,184
Lucky you found me.

576
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:45,595
It was you?
Thank you.

577
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,356
I'm so sorry.

578
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,525
As you should be.

579
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:52,164
I'll call the doctor
in the morning.

580
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,181
I know you don't agree with
all of my choices as a mother,

581
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:58,959
And many days neither do I.

582
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,629
But I'm doing my best.

583
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,217
Joel will get better
if we let him.

584
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:12,714
I think I've had enough of
the world outside for one day.

585
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:14,624
Just want to go to bed.

586
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,035
Of course.

587
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,646
Do you need some help
getting up the stairs?

588
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,734
I think I can manage.

589
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:24,905
Good night.

590
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,159
Thank you.

591
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:32,159
How can we ever thank you?

592
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,476
There's no need.

593
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,163
Corrine's safety's
all I care about.

594
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,406
Well, good night.

595
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,833
I have an early start tomorrow.

596
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,151
No, you don't.

597
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:43,987
You no longer work for me.

598
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,156
You have more than paid
your debt.

599
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,513
From now on your education
is paid for in full.

600
00:48:57,009 --> 00:49:00,079
You should be lying down.

601
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:02,172
I couldn't lie still
if I tried.

602
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:04,083
I thought you were done
with the world for today.

603
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,362
I am.

604
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,573
That one.

605
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:14,535
What we stumbled into
in that storm...

606
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,852
Words like stumbled...

607
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,596
It can never happen again.

608
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,374
You make it sound like
it was an accident.

609
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,524
I'm your uncle.

610
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:24,798
Half... Uncle.

611
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:31,552
We lost ourselves.
I was worried about you.

612
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,099
I was just trying to make sure
you were all right.

613
00:49:37,216 --> 00:49:38,875
That wasn't a worried kiss.

614
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,064
It wasn't a proper one either.

615
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,964
You're right.
Um, then it never happened.

616
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:53,556
I apologize.

617
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,652
You're not the only one
who feels sorry about it.

618
00:49:56,736 --> 00:50:00,656
If you want to be dancing
in time for your ball,

619
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,752
You should get some rest.

620
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:11,833
What about Christopher?

621
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:15,320
Many debutants have used their
uncles for their first dance.

622
00:50:15,404 --> 00:50:17,489
Or fathers.

623
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:20,083
It should be someone closer
to her own age.

624
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,268
Since you two have become
so close

625
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,345
I think it's only appropriate.

626
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:25,497
Christopher is a part
of our family now.

627
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:26,999
Surely my Princess,

628
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,444
You wouldn't mind if I gave you
that first dance.

629
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,005
Christopher, would you do
corrine the honor?

630
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:35,115
Actually, I was thinking
my friend rockford

631
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,509
Could be my first dance.

632
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:39,511
Your friend?

633
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:41,121
You have a male friend.

634
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,667
Rockford taylard.

635
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:46,213
You knew about this male friend
of hers?

636
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,614
Oh, daddy.

637
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:53,525
Who doesn't know of
the taylards?

638
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,545
Mr. Taylard owns the textile
mills just outside of town,

639
00:50:56,629 --> 00:50:58,864
And his son rockford

640
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:02,292
Is just a very sweet
and disciplined young man

641
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,386
Who I happen to have
crossed paths with

642
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,816
At events here and there.

643
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:11,634
And plus he has just finished
his first year

644
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,879
At the blacksburg school
of business.

645
00:51:13,963 --> 00:51:15,397
Are you sure you want to share
your first dance

646
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:17,140
With a relative stranger?

647
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:19,412
Rockford's not a stranger.

648
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,488
Corrine.

649
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,899
You do realize what
you're doing here.

650
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:35,400
Mother...

651
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:38,161
I know why you're hesitant,
but rock's changed.

652
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,756
You don't yet know
what changes a man.

653
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,184
He is still the same person
that defiled you.

654
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,853
Remember that.

655
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:49,081
And remember what we had
to do because of it.

656
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:52,195
Mrs. Foxworth,
a visitor for you.

657
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,369
Mrs. Steiner?
What a surprise.

658
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,539
I'm going to make this brief
Mrs. Foxworth,

659
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,932
Since I don't much enjoy

660
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:10,693
Being in the company
of a person like you

661
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:16,441
Who stains the honor of
a great house like this.

662
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:19,887
I know about
your son's problem.

663
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,224
What problem?

664
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:26,479
The west more land sanitarium.

665
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,631
Three grand.

666
00:52:39,715 --> 00:52:43,302
I'll come by to collect it
next weekend.

667
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:46,246
Unless, of course, you want
the whole world to find out

668
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,659
That your boy is a...
Homosexual.

669
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:12,664
How does she know?

670
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:14,333
The important thing
is that she does

671
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,443
And that she's threatening
to ruin our son.

672
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,854
Joel is in the hospital
trying to get better.

673
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:21,281
If we don't pay her off
it will all be for nothing.

674
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,707
We can't have your
reputation ruined.

675
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,108
I'll arrange for the money.

676
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,020
...And you care for him?

677
00:53:35,104 --> 00:53:36,630
He's exactly what I need.

678
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,800
The complete opposite to
our overly-complicated family.

679
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,693
No one can change
who they care for,

680
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:43,348
Not for anything
in the world.

681
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,701
What about me?

682
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:51,478
Well, of course I care
about you.

683
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,372
Could you from far away?

684
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,891
What are you talking about?

685
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,237
I'm leaving.

686
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,154
What? Why?
You're getting better.

687
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:01,713
And if I stay here
that won't happen.

688
00:54:01,797 --> 00:54:03,243
Not really.

689
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:08,748
What about Harry?

690
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,379
I don't know.

691
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,079
I thought you'd still be
at the office.

692
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,416
I'm leaving.

693
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:03,337
How did you get out of
the hospital?

694
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:08,508
I don't want anything and
I'll never bother you again.

695
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:13,588
If you run, you will never be
welcome back here again.

696
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:15,073
I know.

697
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:17,242
I will say that you are
no longer my son.

698
00:57:17,326 --> 00:57:19,669
Well, you were never much
of a father to me anyway.

699
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:23,190
And I will write you out
of my will.

700
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:26,279
I don't want your money if
it'd give me a life like yours.

701
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:33,033
I'll ask you one last time.

702
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,684
How did you get out
of that hospital?

703
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:38,291
It was me.
I brought him home.

704
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:50,366
You took him out of
the sanitarium

705
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,460
Without consulting me!

706
00:57:52,544 --> 00:57:53,973
Wait for me.

707
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:02,287
I went to visit him.
He was unrecognizable.

708
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:04,380
- We were fixing him.
- We were breaking him.

709
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:06,549
No, you already did.

710
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,810
Just like you broke
our other son!

711
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:10,404
Mal's death was
an accident.

712
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,221
Was it?

713
00:58:12,305 --> 00:58:15,057
You are a curse
on this family.

714
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:17,986
You meddle and our son dies!

715
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,306
You meddle and our other son
becomes an invert!

716
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,308
You meddle and corrine
gets pregnant!

717
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,160
Alicia falls down the stairs!

718
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:27,737
I get poisoned, and now
that godforsaken housekeeper

719
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:29,314
Has come back
to blackmail me!

720
00:58:29,398 --> 00:58:30,757
Why?!

721
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:35,014
Because everything that
you touch, it turns to ash!

722
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:41,020
And I know you wanted that storm
to take corrine away from me.

723
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:51,656
Mal died because you assaulted
his fiancÃ©e.

724
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:58,343
Joel was tortured because you
couldn't love him for who he is.

725
00:58:58,427 --> 00:58:59,953
Corrine fell into the arms
of another man

726
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,605
Because she was running
from yours!

727
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,837
You are the curse, Malcolm!
You are the storm!

728
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,889
Everything you touch.

729
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,581
What?

730
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,214
I went looking for it
the day after they took you.

731
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,341
I found it beside
the driveway.

732
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,568
The face is busted
but you can pawn it.

733
00:59:56,652 --> 00:59:59,846
Get yourself some money so you
can properly get out of here.

734
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,589
With you?

735
01:00:01,673 --> 01:00:03,561
On your own.

736
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,687
Thank you for being there
with me.

737
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,265
For everything.

738
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:14,419
I can't make you go through
this next part with me.

739
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:16,588
You deserve a life without
memories of this place

740
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,106
And all I'll do is make you
return to it

741
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,775
Over and over again.

742
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:22,761
Harry, think about
everything being with me
has put you through.

743
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:25,597
I have.

744
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:27,432
You know, I've been
kicked before.

745
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:29,209
It's not the first time
I pushed to the ground.

746
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,861
I'm, I'm not better yet
but neither are you.

747
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:33,271
We get through this together

748
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:34,381
Just like we got through
last year.

749
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,135
That's the point.

750
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,368
I'm not going to throw
the towel in on you

751
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:41,098
Just 'cause you're scared.

752
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:50,608
I've got a world to see,
and I got you to see it with.

753
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:56,614
Well, where should we
start then?

754
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:00,740
New York.

755
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:06,137
If it's with you,
I was thinking just...

756
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,392
"north."

757
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:28,688
I wish I could force him to
hand over your trust right now.

758
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,515
This is more than enough.

759
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:37,944
Just promise me
you'll live with no regrets.

760
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,199
Only if you do the same.

761
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:42,782
This is going to end
with someone dying.

762
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,453
Get out of this place.
Save yourself.

763
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,207
Leave him.

764
01:02:06,465 --> 01:02:07,894
Bye, baby.

765
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,439
Mr. Foxworth.

766
01:03:04,523 --> 01:03:09,202
A pleasure to work together
again after all these years.

767
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,704
I'm assuming.

768
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,688
Mrs. Steiner.

769
01:03:12,772 --> 01:03:15,950
What you fail to understand
about threatening my name

770
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:18,603
Is I no longer have a son.

771
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:23,699
So, you can blab to whomever
you'd like.

772
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,471
Very well.

773
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,725
I can only imagine how important
tonight's party must be to you.

774
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:35,648
I hope it goes off
without a hitch.

775
01:03:52,404 --> 01:03:53,972
Daddy, where is my dress?

776
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:56,565
It was supposed
to arrive yesterday.

777
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:59,586
I have bad news,
my darling.

778
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,071
Your mother...

779
01:04:02,155 --> 01:04:03,757
...Ruined it.

780
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:07,260
Ruined?! How?

781
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:10,263
Don't you worry,

782
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,352
Because I have one last surprise
for your big night.

783
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:29,852
Thank you.

784
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:53,973
Mother!

785
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,475
Daddy told me what you did
with the dress,

786
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:56,810
But don't worry.
I'm not mad at you.

787
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:58,219
Well, I had it fixed.

788
01:04:58,303 --> 01:04:59,370
Daddy said I could wear

789
01:04:59,454 --> 01:05:01,067
One of grandmother's
dresses instead.

790
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:15,311
You brought that down
from the attic?

791
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:17,831
This is our daughter's night.

792
01:05:46,168 --> 01:05:49,949
She looks even more beautiful.

793
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:51,772
You look...

794
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:52,757
Incredible.

795
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:54,033
Stunning.

796
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,610
You're a vision.

797
01:05:55,694 --> 01:05:58,290
No one will be able to tear
their eyes from you.

798
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,283
You're right.

799
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,465
Nothing must distract
from my corrine.

800
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:12,304
Not tonight.

801
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,316
<i>Take this back
upstairs.</i>

802
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,230
Go on, now.

803
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,474
You sure you know
exactly how to do it?

804
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:45,493
I think the timing
will be important.

805
01:06:45,577 --> 01:06:48,755
You just calm down and you have
yourself a good time.

806
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,090
I know how to talk
to your father.

807
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,971
We'll show him how great
we are on the dance floor.

808
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:13,107
Thank you.

809
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:14,592
Welcome.

810
01:07:52,294 --> 01:07:55,213
<i> âª</i>

811
01:08:13,164 --> 01:08:15,249
Mrs. Steiner...

812
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:19,012
I thought you and Mr. Foxworth
had come to an understanding.

813
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:24,759
Lest there be any confusion,
you are not welcome here.

814
01:08:24,843 --> 01:08:28,354
We did, about your son.

815
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,416
But I'm not here about him.
I'm here about your daughter.

816
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,755
Or should I say Mrs. Alicia
foxworth's daughter.

817
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,524
What a secret to hold.

818
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:52,879
If this gets out, it'll
stain your life forever.

819
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:58,943
Everything you've worked so hard
to build will come to pieces.

820
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:00,720
But something tells me
you're more worried about

821
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:04,223
What will happen to her.

822
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,647
You don't want her to know
who she is, do you?

823
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,066
Oh, hello again,
Mrs. Steiner.

824
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,550
Miss foxworth.

825
01:09:14,634 --> 01:09:16,235
Corrine, where is your father?

826
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,313
I haven't seen him
since the guests arrived.

827
01:09:19,397 --> 01:09:20,573
I hope you enjoy yourself.

828
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,162
Oh, I intend to.

829
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,917
Right this way.

830
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:35,813
<i> âª</i>

831
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,338
Oh, Mr. Foxworth, sir.

832
01:09:44,422 --> 01:09:45,823
I've been looking for you.

833
01:09:45,907 --> 01:09:47,658
Mr. Taylard.

834
01:09:47,742 --> 01:09:51,679
I have something very important
to discuss with you, sir.

835
01:09:51,763 --> 01:09:54,777
I would like to ask for your
daughter's hand in marriage.

836
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,336
Let's discuss this in private,
shall we?

837
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,782
Yeah, sure.

838
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:09,789
A gesture of settling
this amicably.

839
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,958
I've learned through the years
that this is one of

840
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:17,112
The best places for delicate
conversations like these.

841
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:20,219
It's how I even kept some
conversations from you.

842
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:34,630
How did you hear about
such awful rumors?

843
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:37,391
Doctor Curtis keeps
detailed records.

844
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:38,985
You work for doctor Curtis now.

845
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:41,379
His notes go all the way back
to the night

846
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:44,139
You called him to the house
to look at a pregnant woman

847
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,142
Who fell down the stairs
for example,

848
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:51,164
Where he recorded the woman's
delusional rantings

849
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,224
For being kept prisoner.

850
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:55,668
Doctor Curtis doesn't suspect
anything, does he?

851
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:56,985
Oh, don't worry.

852
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,564
He's a bit thick.

853
01:11:00,648 --> 01:11:04,326
But the real tip of the scale,
Mrs. Foxworth.

854
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:09,924
I mean, look at your daughter
then look at you.

855
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:14,565
She's gorgeous
and you're a monster.

856
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:21,194
Three thousand then.

857
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,781
Five.

858
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,453
I'll get your money.

859
01:11:54,202 --> 01:11:54,952
Mother...

860
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:56,454
Corrine darling, not now.

861
01:11:56,538 --> 01:11:57,563
I have something very important
I need to discuss

862
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,714
With your father.

863
01:11:58,798 --> 01:11:59,881
But I can't find
rockford anywhere

864
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:01,883
And the first dance
is about to begin.

865
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:05,824
Christopher. Thank goodness.
Would you be so kind?

866
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,662
It would be my honor.

867
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:22,146
- We have a problem.
- Not now.

868
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,510
Not during corrine's
first dance.

869
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:34,417
<i> âª</i>

870
01:12:57,523 --> 01:12:59,441
I believe congratulations
are in order.

871
01:12:59,525 --> 01:13:01,443
You heard.

872
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:04,630
He's a lucky man,
wherever he is.

873
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,190
Don't do that.

874
01:13:06,274 --> 01:13:08,025
You're not allowed
to be jealous.

875
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,197
He stood you up.

876
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:14,715
Not after what we agreed.

877
01:13:14,799 --> 01:13:17,051
You're my uncle, remember?

878
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:24,558
And as your uncle
I wouldn't want you

879
01:13:24,642 --> 01:13:27,302
To rush into something that
you'll almost certainly regret.

880
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:31,215
I'm more than capable
of making my own choices.

881
01:13:31,299 --> 01:13:33,067
I thought much the same
of myself until...

882
01:13:39,641 --> 01:13:42,335
Until I realized otherwise.

883
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:45,654
There is no worse pain than
being stuck in a life of regret.

884
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:46,655
The gentleman he sounds
as though

885
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:49,675
He speaks from experience.

886
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,902
Do you have any regrets?

887
01:13:55,339 --> 01:13:56,893
With you?

888
01:14:00,678 --> 01:14:01,762
Yes.

889
01:14:20,014 --> 01:14:22,858
I have never been so proud
of you in all my life,

890
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:26,712
And you look so
ravishing tonight.

891
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,789
- Daddy...
- Hmm.

892
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:30,883
Has rockford spoken
to you tonight?

893
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:37,297
He made his intentions clear
and I made mine clearer.

894
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:39,133
Did you hurt him?

895
01:14:39,217 --> 01:14:41,543
Daddy, what did you do?

896
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,455
He won't bother you again.

897
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:48,234
He abandoned you tonight,
corrine

898
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:52,980
And I will never
abandon you.

899
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:57,317
Because you...
Belong to me.

900
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:17,821
Corrine, you were incredible

901
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:19,765
But I really must speak
with your father.

902
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,101
Rockford asked daddy
for permission to marry me

903
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:25,162
And he scared him away or,
or hurt him, or...

904
01:15:25,246 --> 01:15:27,164
Please mother,
you have to talk to him.

905
01:15:27,248 --> 01:15:28,419
Uh...

906
01:15:31,343 --> 01:15:32,686
Do you love him?

907
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,941
Rockford?

908
01:15:35,256 --> 01:15:36,493
Yes.

909
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,784
You don't really.

910
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:41,287
You think you do,
you really think you do,

911
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:43,104
But you don't.

912
01:15:43,188 --> 01:15:46,959
He's just a door to a life
you think you want.

913
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:52,614
But trust me, behind it
is no life at all.

914
01:15:52,698 --> 01:15:54,208
How can you be sure?

915
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:57,711
I can see it in your eyes.
You're not in love with him.

916
01:15:57,795 --> 01:15:59,213
But when you really know,

917
01:15:59,297 --> 01:16:01,456
When you find someone
you really love,

918
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,977
I will support you
no matter what.

919
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,232
This was supposed
to be my night.

920
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,238
Excuse me.

921
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,305
Mrs. Steiner is here.

922
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:19,808
I've locked her
in the library.

923
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:21,235
Why would you do that?

924
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:23,996
Because she knows
about corrine.

925
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,584
Knows about what?

926
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:41,496
You're an animal.

927
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,331
I apologize for resorting
to these methods

928
01:16:43,415 --> 01:16:44,683
But you left me no choice.

929
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:45,926
A wild animal.

930
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,520
I had to find my husband.

931
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:49,913
He's on his way now with
your money, I can assure you.

932
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:51,857
Exactly how do you expect me
to trust you

933
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:55,194
After you kept me locked
in that closet for an hour?

934
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,679
And what's to stop me
from going out there right now

935
01:16:57,763 --> 01:16:59,681
To make a little toast
of my own?

936
01:16:59,765 --> 01:17:01,850
Just know, Mrs. Steiner,

937
01:17:01,934 --> 01:17:04,703
What you seek to destroy,
it's all I have.

938
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,539
A life built on lies.

939
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,207
Maybe.

940
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,209
But it's all I could manage
given the circumstances.

941
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,936
Everything I've done,
every choice I've made,

942
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,775
Good, bad, or somewhere
in between.

943
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:19,200
It's all been
for my children.

944
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:21,870
Corrine is not your child.

945
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:24,723
She may not be of my flesh
but she is of my heart.

946
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,637
Who do you think
you're fooling.

947
01:17:30,721 --> 01:17:32,547
People talk.

948
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,382
Everyone knows that deep down

949
01:17:34,466 --> 01:17:40,297
You're jealous of corrine
for her beauty, for her charm.

950
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:46,061
For the fact that she'll have
a love in her life unlike you.

951
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:49,248
What do you know about love?

952
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,918
Do you think garland
ever loved you in return?

953
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,997
Oh, my apologies, you knew him
as Mr. Foxworth

954
01:17:57,081 --> 01:18:00,926
And he knew you as the woman
who cleaned his chamber pot.

955
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,486
How dare you?

956
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:05,489
This is my house.
I'll dare to do as I please.

957
01:18:05,573 --> 01:18:08,767
I think I'll go find
Mr. Foxworth on my own.

958
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,022
Stop!

959
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:24,858
She was going
to tell everyone.

960
01:18:24,942 --> 01:18:26,705
We have to call a doctor.

961
01:18:30,765 --> 01:18:31,936
Shh.

962
01:19:36,998 --> 01:19:39,110
Our guests are waiting.

963
01:19:41,502 --> 01:19:43,114
Shall we?

964
01:21:33,797 --> 01:21:35,226
- Oh.
- Sorry.

965
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:39,460
What are you doing?

966
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:43,131
Never mind. It's none
of my business.

967
01:21:43,215 --> 01:21:45,984
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

968
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,906
The engagement's off.

969
01:21:51,966 --> 01:21:54,401
I'm not really sure it was
ever really on, but...

970
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:55,914
I'm sorry.

971
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,374
Are you?

972
01:22:01,492 --> 01:22:03,560
Not at all.

973
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:07,506
I have tried so hard
to make it work.

974
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,761
To move on,
to forget about-

975
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:13,253
But fighting what I feel inside

976
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:15,558
Has become more difficult
than facing it.

977
01:22:20,494 --> 01:22:21,353
You.

978
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,096
Stop.

979
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:24,581
You're what I feel inside.

980
01:22:24,665 --> 01:22:25,749
Please.

981
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,175
You're what I want.

982
01:22:27,259 --> 01:22:28,026
Don't.

983
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,781
You're who I love.

984
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:32,617
Do you love me?

985
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,795
Of course I love you.

986
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:50,635
So, what do we do now?

987
01:23:12,046 --> 01:23:14,659
<i>Keeping up an illusion
is hard work.</i>

988
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:23,793
<i>Back-breaking work.</i>

989
01:23:32,991 --> 01:23:35,013
<i>Heartbreaking work.</i>

990
01:23:38,405 --> 01:23:40,185
<i>Teamwork.</i>

991
01:23:44,762 --> 01:23:47,358
<i>At breakfast you want
to kill your husband.</i>

992
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:56,868
<i>By bedtime you're helping
him Bury someone else's body.</i>

993
01:24:13,457 --> 01:24:16,012
<i>But something keeps you
going through it.</i>

994
01:24:36,721 --> 01:24:38,743
Get some rest.

995
01:24:55,574 --> 01:24:59,586
<i>The thought that all of
the blood and dirt and lies</i>

996
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,599
<i>Would be worth it.</i>

997
01:25:07,845 --> 01:25:11,109
<i>But in the end,
because of everything I did...</i>

998
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:16,614
<i>Their lives will be better
than mine.</i>

999
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,623
<i>My children.</i>

1000
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:43,371
<i>Joel got out of
foxworth hall alive.</i>

1001
01:25:43,455 --> 01:25:45,977
<i>Surely corrine could too.</i>

1002
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:05,121
<i>But I was learning the hard way
that my home had too many doors.</i>

1003
01:26:11,316 --> 01:26:14,130
<i>Old ones. New ones.</i>

1004
01:26:21,993 --> 01:26:24,807
<i>Behind each a place to hide.</i>

1005
01:26:32,413 --> 01:26:36,274
<i>That night, each and every one
of foxworth hall's doors</i>

1006
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,196
<i>Would fly open.</i>

1007
01:26:40,787 --> 01:26:43,573
<i>And there would be
no hiding anymore.</i>

1008
01:26:44,305 --> 01:27:44,564
