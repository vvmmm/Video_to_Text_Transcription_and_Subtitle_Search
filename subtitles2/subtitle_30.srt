00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,730
How's it going? Is it close to Ho Chi Minh City

3
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,060
The perfect resort for Boss Choi

4
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,610
Why is development slow here

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,990
It used to be a semiconductor factory

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,200
The project was approved as a tourist destination when they heard it was closed

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,700
Look at the location and the view

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm sure a lot of tourists will come once the development starts

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,830
Who did you say I was meeting today

10
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,250
He's the head of a car rental agency

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,710
He said he must meet President Choi

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,630
How much did you charge

13
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,960
For what? - For what

14
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,130
Is that what you think I am

15
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,470
What do you take me for

16
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,100
He'd do anything to hang out with you

17
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,600
Cui presidents

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Are you sober

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,270
How the hell did that drink cost so much yesterday

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,610
I had the honor to drink wine Louis XIII for the first time yesterday with the light of Cui's boss

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,440
Why did you let him do that

22
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,610
I should have stopped him

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,200
Don't you make a lot of money, too

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,820
I made a lot of money

25
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,950
But we need to spend our money wisely

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,950
Don't spend money on booze every fucking day

27
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,790
Come on, let's get this day over with and get a hangover

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,870
He begged me for hours to see you in person

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I hear he's got a lot of money

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,090
Well, he's not just dealing with Koreans

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,760
There are many buildings in Ho Chi Minh City

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,890
you

33
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,930
The boss is Choi Yong-ki

34
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,050
Is my hello

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,850
I've heard so much about you

36
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,140
Please get on the bus

37
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,640
Well, you guys talk

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,810
Don't you hot

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,480
You're eating a cookie

40
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,570
Why don't you eat something good

41
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,160
I heard what Jonghoon said

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,080
He said you ran a pretty big car rental business

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,460
I hear you have a lot of money

44
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,460
what

45
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,710
You his mama

46
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,920
You son of a bitch

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,310
- Oh, it's hot. - Hey, what the fuck are you doing

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,180
What are you doing, son of a bitch

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,690
Get out of the way points

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,570
Do I look like I run a car rental agency to you

51
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,910
You were kidnapped

52
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,590
Hey, you son of a bitch put that knife down

53
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,840
Hey, put the knife down, boy

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,090
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I didn't say that

55
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm the fucking shin of Yeongdeungpo

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,220
I know, I know

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,890
- Said he knew, boy. - What's he talking about

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,010
What the hell do you know

59
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,520
- Hey. - Leave the girl alone, boy

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,850
What the fuck?

61
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,140
- Don't fucking touch me. - Come on

62
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,980
Get over here and I'll give you a fucking knife

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,610
Why the fuck are you not answering your phone again

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,030
Oh, oh, here, here

65
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,950
It's this way

66
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,620
- There you are. - Here, here

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,820
Hello? Where? Where?

68
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,290
- In there. - No, I mean tin channel. Where is he

69
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,250
He's not answering his phone

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,500
This his mama

71
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,040
Get over here, get over here

72
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,170
I need you to put that knife down

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,180
You are here

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,180
What's the

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,510
What took you so long to get here

76
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,600
Oh, I went on that blind date thing

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,140
What kind of blind date goes on once a week

78
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,310
Well, he has to get married, too

79
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,350
What's wrong with him

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,560
Young Shin named Yeongdeungpo is a total lunatic

81
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,900
- New? - You sons of bitches

82
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,650
- Just escaped from a mental hospital. - Don't worry about me

83
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,570
The hostage?

84
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,030
The shopkeeper's aunt and a college girl altogether two

85
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,280
Hey, man, why don't we just break in

86
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

87
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,370
It's too dangerous. Maybe we should call it suppression

88
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,580
Now we don't know what this maniac is capable of

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,790
Where are all of us

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,710
Hey, keep your hands down and there's a lot of people watching

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,420
You puppies

92
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,790
Do you know how hard it is for the yakuza

93
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,710
Calm down, calm down

94
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,340
What's wrong with your mother

95
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,680
Can't cook

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,630
- What are you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,340
Yeah, you must be tired

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,970
Get the fuck over here

99
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,310
Watch out. I gave you all the knives

100
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,020
Where are you from

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,650
Oh, shit.

102
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,530
Oh, my god

103
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:01,990
hello

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,450
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,820
- What are you doing, man? - What

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,030
- Come here and talk. - Why

107
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,950
yeah

108
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,700
- Stay away. - Not you

109
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,080
- Stay the fuck away. - Wait, wait, wait

110
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,330
This is dangerous

111
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,500
Hey, you boy

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,250
Is it the first time you've seen me and the first time I've seen you

113
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,580

114
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,590
Can you believe me

115
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,130
I don't fucking believe that

116
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,090
Danger put the knife down

117
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,590
I told you to put the fucking knife down

118
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,640
- Hey, get the men out of here. - Yeah

119
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,220
- Hong Seok. - Get out, get out

120
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,390
To this to this

121
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,930
Hurry up

122
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,230
Get them in the car

123
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,980
- Get your hands off me. - Hey, boy

124
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,560
If you stab someone with a knife

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,230
You say it hurts you say it hurts

126
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,900
- Does it hurt? - It hurts

127
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,360
Smelly boy

128
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,530
Give me up

129
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,450
You fucking

130
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,660
What the fuck

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,290
You fucking

132
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,910
You're not a zombie

133
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,380
Come here please don't take pictures

134
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,710
Come here please don't take pictures

135
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,550
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

136
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,880
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

137
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,800
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

138
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,010
What kind of excessive repression is that

139
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,310
In front of some lunatic with a knife

140
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,680
Is the police going to make a deal and say, Sir, please calm down

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,890
I told you how good you were doing and gave you thumbs up

142
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,850
These guys are still writing stories like this

143
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,310
These guys are still writing stories like this

144
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,770
ok

145
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,230
I had my eyes covered and I didn't know it was me

146
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,360
Hey eee, you should cover up

147
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,070
You can't tell

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,570
- Tell me the truth. - What

149
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,990
Anyone would think you were a criminal based on your face

150
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,490
Boy's got a lot of nerve

151
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,580
No more our big brother

152
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,040
Kind of a Russian mob vibe

153
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,290
Hey, hey, if you say that

154
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,160
Your class leader and the others have more

155
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,500
He's just a terrorist

156
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,550
His face has been growing down since high school

157
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,090
- Don't you think so? - Yeah

158
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,090
There is a feeling of standing in the community of changsheng column

159
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,470
You know what I mean

160
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,140
It feels like yesterday's length is different than today's

161
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,140
- Don't you think so? - That's when I first met the squad leader

162
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,930
- Quiet, quiet. - Almost put the cuffs on him

163
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,680
Be quiet with your buttoned-up cuffs

164
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,810
Interesting?

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,980
Was it that much fun?

166
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,190
You have come

167
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,860
It's

168
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,700
You seem pretty happy to be in the news

169
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,950
I am hard luck!

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,450
I just should

171
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,500
- Ugh. - What a terrible thing to be called

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,830
I'll go and plead with the chief and come back

173
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,460
That's it. That's it

174
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,340
You should go to Vietnam

175
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,750
- Vietnam. - Vietnam for what

176
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,170
Meet Yoo Jong-hoon

177
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,010
- I don't know who. - Isn't that who

178
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,300
The same guys who robbed the gold and silver store in Garifong last year

179
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,300
This is the boy on the lookout

180
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,890
This is the boy on the lookout

181
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, this guy got it

182
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,310
For he is

183
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,810
He turned himself in in Vietnam for stealing gold and silver

184
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,980
- Why? - I don't know

185
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,400
So you're in charge of bringing him in

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,480
Think of it as a business trip for two days and three nights

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,940
Haven't been abroad for a long time

188
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,900
- Who are you going with? - Dude

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
My dad was a Vietnam warrior

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,780
It should be me, the son, this time

191
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,450
Big brother my sister's brother's friend's

192
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,870
- Best friend lives in Vietnam. - What's wrong with this guy

193
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,660
- I'll try. - You son of a bitch

194
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,410
You had nothing to do with this

195
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,870
- You want to put your hands down? - Feed you guys

196
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,630
What do you think this is for fun

197
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,420
We're on our way to pick up a murderer

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
This is very important shit

199
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,510
I go with him

200
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,510

201
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,510
- Wait, wait, wait. - What

202

How are we supposed to go with each other

203
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,140
- We need someone who speaks English. - English

204
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,140
Monitor do you speak English

205
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,520
- Are you talking to me about English now? - Tell me

206
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,650
I'd like a salad, but

207
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,610
- Is that all right? - You speak English so well

208
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,030

209
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,820
If you go abroad with me

210
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,070
Everything is ok

211
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,120
All right, all right, all right, I'm done talking to you

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,790
Wow, our monitor is really decent

214
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,010
Yo! Fuck

215
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Didn't you say it was okay to go with you

216
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,350
They don't understand British pronunciation at all

217
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,430
Aye yo mama

218
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,180
I knew something was wrong when you said what kind of vinegar

219
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,060
I just wanted to see Vietnam

220
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,520

The police

225
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,910
We're too busy to leave now

226
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,620
Out right Out

227
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,410
quiet

228
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,830
- You don't understand a word of fucking English. - Don't call me names

229
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,750
I can understand Korean

231
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,340
I sit down first

232
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm sorry

233
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,850
thank you

234
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,970
Alas!

235
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,810
I'm running a little late

236
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,810
I am Park Chang-soo, police resident officer at the Korean Consulate General

237
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,900
-Uh-oh

238
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,310
Nice to see you

239
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,860
I am the full-time monitor of Jinchuan City

240
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,030
- So you're class president? - Yeah

241
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,030
I'm Ma Xidao in charge

242
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,360
- The person in charge. - Yeah, yeah, yeah

243
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,070
The staff I work for

244
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,320
He didn't speak a word of English

245
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,160
It's been a bit of a farce

246
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,370
ok

247
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,500
Do you want to eat before you go out

248
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
- Yeah, sure, sure. - Sure, sure

249
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,630
Well, you take your bag and your luggage

250
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,420
- Bao Bao. - But there's nothing to eat here

251
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,840
Here, here, here, here

252
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,550
Where is all that stuff

253
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,380
- There. - Ah

254
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,770
Is this only a thousand dollars a thousand

255
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,890
- Yeah. - Oh, my God

256
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,270
I don't know how I can travel without money

257
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,310
They all need a discount

258
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Those guys over there are Korean gangsters

259
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,700
- Right? - Korean gangsters everywhere you go

260
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,490
There are a lot more Koreans doing business around here

261
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,570
The underworld has also increased

262
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,370
Violent crime also gives me a headache

263
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,870
What the fuck are you looking at

264
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,460
Underworld hello

265
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,920
- All the way to Vietnam. - Fuck you

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,380
- It's a cop. - Are you sure

267
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,840
- Cops. - Really? You sure

268
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
- Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Put it on

269
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,760
Hey, there's some weird stuff in there

270
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,930
And what looked like marijuana

271
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,300
Those guys are weird

272
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,510
What? Marijuana isn't.

273
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,100
- I'm on my way. - Oh, no

274
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,350
- Oh, you. - Not one of them

275
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,350
Can we take a break

276
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,400
- Look, they're leaving. Look, look. - Go, go, go

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,810
- Korean, right? - Yeah

278
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,310
- Hey, hey, hey. - We're having our opening

279
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,520
- The price is perfect right now. - What are you doing

280
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,690
- Service like Gangnam price like Ho Chi Minh - how so many Koreans

281
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,700
- All right, all right, kid. - Like Vietnam

282
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,610
Take away!

283
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,240
- Hey, hey. - Hey

284
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,700
Temasek,

285
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,240
You are the essential oil

286
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,950
The eldest brother

287
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,040
The kid

288
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,160
What the hell are you doing here

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,500
I have to think about life, too

290
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,380
Don't you get it

291
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,170
I can't spend my whole life in Korea like that

292
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
Whoa, whoa, then you shouldn't be doing this

293
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,220
I think I could do it in the morning

294
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,760
Our brother is very active in his work

295
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,930
This is who

296
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,760
I am cooking oil

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,060
What's cooking oil?

298
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,730
But I don't know what you're doing here

299
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,980
Are you here to arrest a prisoner

300
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,060
A vacation for a vacation

301
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,270
Be careful, brothers

302
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,440
Police in South Korea

303
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,440
It's not gonna work here

304
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,900
In the underworld here

305
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,030
There are a lot of guys who carry guns

306
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,030
- The gun? - Yeah

307
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,620
Some with guns and some with marchetti

308
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,330
A sword

309
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,950
The atmosphere here is totally different from Korea

310
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,450
right

311
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,460
It's none of our business. We're just here on vacation

312
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,210
- How could we get shot? - Yeah

313
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,250
- Then come and play. - Yeah

314
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,300
- Sure. - The service is like Gangnam

315
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,210
- Where are we going? Forget it. - Prices like Ho Chi Minh

316
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,600
The consulate is no different than our office

317
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,810
Oh, it's a bad environment

318
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,140
Anyway, at least we have air conditioning

319
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,770
Yeah, it's hot

320
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,270
- How could you do that? - You waited

321
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,730
ok

322
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,310
It's really hot

323
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,860
Yeah, it's hot

324
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,900
Looks like there's a lot of missing passengers around here

325
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,070
Yeah, over 30,000 visitors a month

326
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,280
There will be more cases

327
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,450
There are also many iron heart of their own play disappear

328
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,370
It's all about money

329
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,870
Just sign your name right here

330
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,000
You just take this file

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,210
Give it to immigration control

332
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,460
After 10:00 tomorrow morning

333
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,960
You can take the person away

334
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,830
But why so many files

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,550
- Because this case is also very rare. - What

336
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,630
The criminal came to the consulate to answer for it

337
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,840
There's no precedent

338
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,340
Vacate a room in a hurry

339
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,680
He was temporarily detained

340
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,260
But we also have many difficulties

341
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,770
But why did he turn himself in

342
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,060
He said it was his conscience

343
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,150
Feel what you feel

344
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,030
He said he had a bad conscience

345
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,240
Conscience is the task of

346
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
- Conscience. - What the hell

347
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
Ah this

348
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,660
Oh, shit, I made a mistake

349
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,620
The whole conscience

350
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm sorry to trouble you

351
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,590
Zhong Xun!

352
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,880
Why did you turn yourself in

353
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,470
I'm really soul-searching

354
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,930
I'm going to Korea to be punished

355
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,430
You want to go to South Korea

356
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,860
You're eating a lot of food

357
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,400
It's

358
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,860
Monitor of the class

359
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,360
To the real room

360
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,910
Take this?

361
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,660
Well know

362
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,160
Give it to me

363
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,840
Well done

364
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,590
Well, you keep an eye on it

365
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,800
ok

366
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,060
Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.

367
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,230
Elder brother know

368
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,100
I don't know what you know

369
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,810
Why did you say you turned yourself in again

370
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Because your conscience smitten you

371
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
- A guilty conscience? - Ah

372
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,910
Clock clock clock clock

373
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,700
Clock bell

374
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,040
Jondo tried to kill me

375
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,830
The clock is there

376
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,620
Is that Jong-du Lee with you

377
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,080
- He's here, too, isn't he? - No

378
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Isn't it

379
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,130
HSS

380
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,920
I know everything, don't I

381
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,930
Or we could take an ear off

382
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,930
Ear ear ear

383
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,430
Vice President

384
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,560
You go easy

385
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,470
There are a lot of ears. It wouldn't hurt to take one off

386
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,230
I need you to start talking

387
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,020
- Why would Lee kill you? - Pain pain

388
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,940
Pain pain

389
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,110
I touched a woman that Chung was seeing

390
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,230
Take the damn thing off his ear

391
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,150
Hey, if Lee Jong-du is here

392
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,610
That gold from the white is also in the choice

393
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,660
Didn't the three of you work together

394
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,410
- No. - Oh

395
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,660
HSS

396
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,290
No, no, no, no, no

397
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,370
Even if you don't say

398
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,170
I know everything, too

399
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,090
It's not what you're doing here

400
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,710
Is that the kuang one? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

401
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,710
Why are you doing this all of a sudden

402
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,510
Don't move. Don't move before you get hurt

403
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,890
If you move, you're dead

404
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,180
Save me

405
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,060
Is it under construction

406
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,690
- My eardrums are bursting. - Don't do it

407
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,600
Pain, Don't play

408
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,110
Not that I really don't know

409
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,230
I don't know where to start

410
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,400
Ah, you don't know where it is, do you

411
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,990
That means you know where the clock is, right

412
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,410
I think we're just gonna go down there and arrest people

413
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,750
I don't think so

414
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,870
I was on my way to pick up a guy

415
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,920
You caught a couple of them so you can go back and get promoted

416
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,040
No, no, no.

417
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,170
We can't do this without jurisdiction

418
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,760
It's illegal for you to investigate or arrest here

419
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
Hello I said

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,170
I was just trying to convince him to turn himself in

421
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,300
What kind of investigation is that?

422
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,090
You go there and you investigate

423
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,430
Aren't you on a blind date

424
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,890
- That's research. - Get over here

425
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,560
- What are you talking about? - Yoo Jong-hoon

426
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,060
Did you say anything

427
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,020
I've been talking bullshit ever since

428
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,520
Monitor this file

429
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,020
I'll just hand it over to immigration

430
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,060
Ah well

431
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,030
Oh, I have a brother here that I know

432
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,570
- I have to go see him. - Okay

433
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,110
Do you know where this is, perhaps

434
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,530
It's not that far from us, is it

435
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,870
But it's kind of a rough neighborhood

436
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,160
That's not a problem

437
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,290
He is more dangerous

438
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,920
Is this

439
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,930
Hello, somebody, somebody.

440
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,560
Fuck locked

441
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,640
- Is it locked? Yes

442
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,440
!

443
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,070
opened

444
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,070
Hey, how did you break the lock

445
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,950
- Shit. - Jongdo Jonghoon already told us everything

446
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,620
South Korea

447
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,830
!

448
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,830
This is what

449
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,870
- why - fuck

450
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,710
Oh my god

451
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,960
What the fuck is going on here

452
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,010
This is a homicide

453
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,930
- Ugh. - Damn it

454
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,680
That's a big head

455
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Call Consul Park

456
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,850
Hey, get up, boy

457
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,400
up

458
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,360
What are you lying about here, boy

459
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,690
What's the matter

460
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,860
Lee Jong-du was murdered

461
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,820
Tell me what you've been doing here

462
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,580
- You want to get beat up? - Sergeant

463
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,040
Not vice president that could be a problem

464
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,290
Squad leader, talk to him

465
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,160
I need you to talk some sense into him

466
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,380
Don't start work

467
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,420
Hey, why don't you stop looking like that

468
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,630
- LET me let you go. - What

469
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,340
- I think that's a good idea. - What

470
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Hurry up to come over

471
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,010
- Come here. - It's not a police officer

472
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,350
I turned myself in

473
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,470
Surrender?

474
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,930
I will not accept surrender you get out

475
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,350
- Get out of here. - Didn't I fucking turn myself in

476
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,650
Arguing in front of who the fuck

477
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,980
Dare to swear in front of anyone

478
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,230
I'll walk you out

479
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,570
- Help me! - Get out of here

480
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,570
Save me

481
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,900
- Go home. - Wait, wait, wait

482
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,990
- What is this about? - I was wrong

483
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,490
- What are you doing? - I'm wrong

484
00:19:59,490 --> 00:19:59,860
Let him down

485
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,200
I am in Vietnam

486
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,700
Ran into a kid named Jiang Haishang and we kidnapped a guy

487
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,210
Who is Jiang Hai Shang

488
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,580
Jianghai is he

489
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,130
Encouraging us to kidnap Choi Yong-ki, who runs the resort

490
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,920
Because Choi yong-ki's family is rich

491
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,550
I'm too young to be polite

492
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,800
Spending money like water

493
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,380
Give me a

494
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,680
It's only $50,000

495
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,850
Fuck not even 90 million Korean dollars

496
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,520
If you got the

497
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,730
Less than 20 million won per person

498
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,770
What the hell is that talking about

499
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,980
hello

500
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,110
What's the matter

501
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,820
Don't tell me you went through all this trouble for a little money

502
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,690
Tell me about it

503
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,490
Clock degrees

504
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,240
I let them in because you said they were sophisticated

505
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,950
I didn't realize it was a bunch of rookies

506
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,120
- What? - You mean a novice

507
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,080
Is it too innocent

508
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,250
What the fuck

509
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,210
What the fuck

510
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,380
Mama of

511
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,420
What are you talking about hello

512
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,260
If it wasn't for boss Choi's money

513
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,380
I would have killed it for you

514
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,140
Oh, look at you for getting fucked

515
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,100
Son of a bitch

516
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,890
Don't you want to make money

517
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,100
Enough is enough

518
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,980
You talk a little bit

519
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,150
- What the fuck. - Hey, hey

520
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,400
- Hey, hey, hey. - Let go

521
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,810
Enough is enough

522
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,820
- What the fuck is this guy? - Put him in fucking custody

523
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,950
Stop! Stop! Stop

524
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll come back to it later

525
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,280
Get that son of a bitch

526
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,710
You stop the fuck right there

527
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,550
You fucking

528
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,880
We can't let him get away

529
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,550
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

530
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,140
Fuck what?

531
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,970
Get the fuck out of him

532
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,480
Hey, stand over there fucking right now

533
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,440
I have no choice but to come here

534
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,270
Get the fuck over here.

535
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,610
I have no choice but to come here

536
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,870
- Get the fuck over here. - You son of a bitch

537
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,950
Fuck your mother

538
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,740
Do you want to die

539
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,370
Hold on, hold on, hold on

540
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,460
I'll I'll give you 100 million each

541
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,210
- I'll give you $100 million each. - Fuck

542
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,670
- Fuck. - $100 million each

543
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,960
- Are you serious? - In my hotel room

544
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,760
It's over 200 million and a little bit of gold

545
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,050
Just cut me some slack, please

546
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,590
So what the fuck is the code

547
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,390

548
547
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,470
2963?

549
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,140
2963 that's right!

550
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,770
So I said

551
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,020
If you'd given me the money when I asked for it

552
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,310
- Isn't that all? - I'm sorry

553
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,110
I wish you had told me

554
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,520
It's a fucking effort.

555
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,690
Why don't we make a resort until the kid gets here

556
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,320
Your fucking mouth

557
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,160
You fucking lie one more time and you're dead

558
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,370
Mama of

559
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,590
Dead?

560
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,470
You must be a fucking lunatic

561
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,760
Are you crazy

562
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,890
What if you kill someone

563
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,140
You have no choice

564
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,140
Don't kill the money before you get it

565
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,350
You son of a bitch

566
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,150
Fucking money...

567
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,190
What's going on? Fuck.

568
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,240
It's good to lose personal money

569
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,340
What the fuck is this all about

570
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,010
You're not gonna do your job right

571
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,420
Hurry up, boy

572
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,440
It's really convenient to work abroad

573
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,480
The police don't mind their own business

574
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,020
Convenient operation

575
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,650
From the hotel safe

576
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,820
200 million and a little nugget

577
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,110
That's it?

578
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,320
I think we can get some more

579
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,620
again

580
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,410
Hello to you

581
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,120
First, don't move

582
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,760
Then it takes about two days for the money to arrive

583
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,510
The clock and I just ran away

584
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,480
That kid's eyes changed when the money came in

585
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,850
And then not long ago

586
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,980
Strange people started poking around me

587
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,400
This guy is Jiang Haishang

588
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,900
Sent his men here to kill me, too

589
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,990
I'm sorry

590
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,990
All the more reason you should have said something sooner

591
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,030
Is that why you turned yourself in

592
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,790
right

593
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,950
He clock degrees

594
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,540
Jiang Hai Shang must have killed him, too

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,920
He'd kill me if he knew I was here

596
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,130
please

597
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,750
Take me back to Korea, brother

598
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,960
What are we gonna do about this

599
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,930
Look for the bodies

600
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,890
You're happy, aren't you? Damn it

601
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,300
You write down the address here

602
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,390
- The address? - Yeah

603
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,140
The vice monitor

604
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,520
And then things get very complicated

605
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,060
I didn't say anything like that

606
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,270
We need to at least get this address

607
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,020
Ok ok

608
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,900
Monitor of the class

609
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,320
This really needs to be handled by the police

610
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,950
Or you will be forcibly sent home

611
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,200
Then please

612
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,120
- What? - Will you just forcibly repatriate him, please

613
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Forget it

614
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,160
Sergeant, can I do this for you

615
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,830
Alas! The eldest brother

616
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,920
Interesting?

617
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,710
Look up the name Jiang Hae-shang

618
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,710
Let's see if we have a record

619
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,430
Then check if there have been any reports of choi yong-ki's disappearance recently

620
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,470
Kang Hae-sang and Choi Yong-ki

621
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,850
Any other details

622
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,060
Didn't the

623
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,480
Hung up the

624
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,690
Good good

625
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,230
Thank you

626
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,650
So did you say anything

627
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,230
It's the same cops who don't understand cops

628
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,570
It's gonna be a month before we get a warrant

629
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,200
When the time comes jiang Hai is still that boy

630
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,780
He's gone to another country

631
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,620
Well, it's not Korea

632
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,580
That's right Yesterday the whole

633
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,080
Is there anything we can do about him

634
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,750
- I said no. - No, I can't

635
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,920
- Shit. - Where are you going

636
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Vice President

637
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Squad leader deputy squad leader where are we going

638
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,710
I need you to talk to him

639
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,460
Let's go talk to him

640
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,880
He must have listened even less

641
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,050
Have you seen this man

642
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,640
I don't know what you're talking about

643
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,270
Hello tin road,

644
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,440
I know I can't stop you

645
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,060
But this is not Garibong Dong

646
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,320
Wait etc.

647
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,400
- Oh, you are. - Wait a minute

648
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,950
What are you doing here, Officer Ma

649
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,570
I just want to take this kid down

650
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,700
Get out of my way

651
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,410
Wait a minute

652
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,410
The police officer

653
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,750
You really can't

654
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,830
Will you be responsible if anything goes wrong here

655
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,120
That's illegal

656
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,130
I'm not saying if the laws of this country

657
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,420
Can't protect the people of our country

658
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,130
Well, at least we can protect them, right

659
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,550
You're right

660
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,340
Isn't it

661
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,930
Mama of

662
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,970
Call the police the police

663
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,020
Then we'll all be taken away

664
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,740
But are you sure there's something to it

665
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
Are you farming

666
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,240
Dig for me seriously faster faster

667
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,950
- It's an earthworm. - Shit

668
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,290
What thing

669
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,310
Hey, I got it. I got it

670
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
I fuck

671
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,520
There's also here

672
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,400
It would have been

673
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
What a mess

674
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,360
I'll contact the police

675
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,710
There were four bodies

676
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,090
I'm really here on vacation

677
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,630
- What's up, man? - Hello

678
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,760
Have you heard of jiang Haishang

679
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,100
Why are you going after this kid, too

680
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,760
How do you know him

681
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,720
There's a Korean underworld

682
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,100
It's quite famous around here as a ra-nine

683
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,350
It's been around since about three days ago

684
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,360
Jianghai still find

685
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,020
- Pull nine? - Yeah

686
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,020
Where is the boy now

687
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,900
I don't know about that

688
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,990
Is there something wrong with you

689
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,900
Text me when you find out

690
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,070
The eldest brother eldest brother

691
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,080
- What hotel? - What? What

692
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,540
No no no hotel

693
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,750
- We are. - I'm calling you

694
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Mom let go

695
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,260
- We're cops, too. - Squad leader

696
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,880
So many people have died in our country

697
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,380
- How could I do nothing? - Squad leader

698
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,300
How do we not have the right to investigate

699
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,640
I pulled a gun gun gun gun

700
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,970
That's also the case

701
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,350
So let me do it here

702
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,560
- Why don't you go back to the hotel? - Okay, okay

703
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,390
Ok, I know. Sorry, sorry

704
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,850
- Got it. - OK, I know

705
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,730
This kid has to be caught

706
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,650
Just bring it to the Korean consulate

707
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,400
I think I can get a plane back to Korea

708
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,240
How are you gonna catch it

709
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,530
Any plans

710
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,580
Come with me

711
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,170
Wow, it's really hot

712
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,720
Are you there yet?

713
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,350
- Where? - Here, here, here

714
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,810
The boss

715
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,310
Let's go

716
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,610
I want half a million dollars in cash

717
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,570
- You checked with your own eyes, right? - There are a lot of tourist bags

718
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,320
Sure that's right

719
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,950
I confirmed it myself

720
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,450
I also saw Jiang Haishang went out this morning

721
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,580
Did go

722
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,420
good

723
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,880
thank you

724
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,800
Wow, so many

725
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,840
Look at this guy

726
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,800
At least a billion dollars

727
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,180
How many people did you kill? This is

728
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,010
Let's get the money out of here

729
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,850
ok

730
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,980
To find the

731
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,900
How did you get here

732
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,360
I came by bus

733
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,950
Do you think it

734
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,620
All of them are Korean

735
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,710
feed

736
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,620
You come over

737
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,750
To come over

738
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,380
- What? - What

739
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,510
Pull the nine nine call what he is to me

740
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,090
Who are you

741
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,430
All of these are Korean gangsters

742
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,300
Hey, everybody get over here

743
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,680
Are you the police

744
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,020
Get out of here and stop looking for trouble

745
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,060
Is there

746
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,310
Where to go

747
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
Just lie down. Lie down

748
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
Could get hurt

749
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Just lie down

750
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,670
- Hey. - Lie down

751
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,470
The Korean police came to someone else's place of business

752
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,220
What the hell is wrong with you sons of bitches

753
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,180
Are you the police

754
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,640
You must be Ra-koo

755
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,270
Yeah, I'm a fucking asshole

756
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,480
You are what

757
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,650
- I'm the little one. - That's really bad

758
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,820
You are all dead

759
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,280
This is Vietnam

760
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,370
This is not Korea

761
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,200
fuck

762
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,620
That's a real gun the kid's got

763
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,170
So, this kid's gonna kill somebody

764
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,170
Come here, come here, come here

765
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,960
I'll shoot you in the head

766
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,460
- Don't fuck me. - Spare my life

767
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,670
Stay the fuck away from me

768
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,420
Don't move don't move

769
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,510
All don't move

770
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,550
Don't move or I'll shoot you

771
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,970
Don't move, either of you

772
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,980
If you don't tell the truth from now on

773
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,850
- All right? - All right

774
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,480
Make it clear to me

775
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,360
Why do you want Jiang Haishang

776
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,400
We did take the money

777
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,440
We were given the address details and I don't know

778
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
So I said who

779
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,030
All I know is it's from Korea

780
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,780
I know nothing but professional killers

781
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,700
Killer?

782
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,700
right

783
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,370
So we found Jiang Haishang

784
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,290
That little strip over there

785
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,170
hello

786
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,460
Who are you

787
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,500
- I owe you. - Don't owe you. Get over here

788
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,380
- I'll be right back. - Hard work

789
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
Brother, where are you?

790
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,100
We just got Kang Hae-sang's location and we're heading there

791
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,520
Did you learn anything

792
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,890
Jiang Haizang requested a friend of the department of information

793
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,150
A survey of

794
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,270
There is something strange about Choi's remarks

795
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,020
- He wasn't reported missing. - Really

796
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,030
What about his parents and the rest of his family

797
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,400
What does his father do

798
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,200
The name is Cui Chunbai

799
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,240
The owner of JOEUNCAPITAL, a private loan firm

800
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,830
Where does Cui Chunbai seem to have heard of this name

801
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,500
HSS this person

802
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,210
He was the head of the myeongdong loan market

803
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,920
The name of the loan company is actually lending money to corporations

804
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,590
A day's worth of cash

805
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,210
More than many chaebol

806
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,220
But the son went missing and never reported it

807
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,430
I'm not gonna dig into him again

808
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,140
Okay, look into it and I'll call you back

809
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,390
good

810
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,970
How's that

811
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,140
He must have been Choi yong-ki's father

812
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,730
Send someone to kill the man who kidnapped his son

813
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,640
what

814
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,500
Here we go

815
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,350
Yo, look at this guy

816
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,280
Give me death

817
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,580
Are you from Korea

818
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,450
Did you take my money

819
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,880
Who sent you

820
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,260
Fucking roll

821
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,430
Cui Chunbai

822
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,020
Cui Chunbai cui Chunbai

823
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,980
Yong-ki's father, right

824
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,410
Yonki's father

825
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,120
I am Jiang Haishang

826
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,830
You're not dead yet

827
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,500
Did you send someone to kill me

828
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,050
You take money and you kill people

829
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,760
You think you're gonna be fine

830
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,390
I told him to go home

831
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,390
But I didn't say anything about bringing him home alive

832
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,600
I'm gonna kill you for sure

833
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,110
Why did you take my money

834
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,610
what

835
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,950
Give it back to me

836
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,280
Otherwise I would have gone back to Korea

837
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,790
This helpless courtesy was eaten by the dog

838
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,230
Hey, wait, wait, wait

839
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,770
- All right. - What are you doing with that gun

840
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,770
I just forgot to give it back

841
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,190
Under such an inferior

842
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,950
The door was open

843
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,610
Mama of

844
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,870
You must have run away on the scent

845
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,620
What the fuck is that

846
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,250
That's a couple of dead people

847
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,670
I think we're a little late

848
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,260
Mama of

849
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,690
But why are there so many travel bags

850
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,900
Young dog

851
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,190
Pick on one of our own

852
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,190
Look at these passports.

853
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,320
This is what

854
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,110
We found Choi Yong-ki

855
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,870
Mama of

856
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,670
Get the fuck over here

857
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,610
You son of a bitch

858
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,110
Are you Jiang Haishang

859
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,700
Is the police

860
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,460
Don't move

861
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,420
Put the knife down

862
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,840
Put the knife down

863
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,520
Monitor of the class

864
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,150
What the fuck

865
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,860
This thing is not called a gun shit

866
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,990
I have no idea

867
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,080
No, that's not a bad thing to say

868
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,830
How is this for our own people

869
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,080
The things that come up

870
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,090
If that's what we're gonna do

871
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,760
Of course I know there's an order to everything

872
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,510
Hello tin road,

873
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,880
We got to catch that son of a bitch

874
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,300
I was so angry

875
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,140
You know I'm gonna catch that kid

876
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,970
- You need to calm down. - How do I calm down

877
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,560
I can't even pee alone right now

878
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,810
Damn it, call me if you need to pee

879
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,440
Oh, come back

880
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,690
We're stuck here

881
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,030
How long are you staying

882
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,860
-Uh-huh. Hong Seok

883
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,530
Big brother, are you okay

884
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,860
How about the monitor and others

885
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,620
Sergeant, he's fine.

886
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Jianghai yet?

887
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,830
Intelligence has been gathering information about what's going on in Southeast Asia

888
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,950
Documents on the kidnapping and murder of Korean tourists

889
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,870
Philippines Cambodia

890
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,580
However, the four cases are the same as Jiang Hae-sang's crime methods

891
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,210
After getting close, I got familiar

892
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,380
Threatening money for kidnapping

893
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,880
But no one came back alive after the transfer

894
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,180
How many people in all

895
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,680
So far we've got four

896
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,800
Oh, the eldest brother

897
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,520
Director he also said

898
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,930
I want you to stop getting in trouble and get back here

899
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,560
I got it. Let's go

900
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,230
How are you, Monitor

901
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,730
- Is everything okay? - Ouch

902
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,520
Ok ok

903
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,730
It's just an exaggerated cry of pain

904
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,820
So didn't I tell you to go back to the hotel

905
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,780
Is really of alas

906
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,910
You two

907
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,070
They've all been deported

908
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,330
- What? - When the person in charge comes

909
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,830
You need to get to the airport now

910
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,910
- Wait a minute. - Wait a minute

911
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:50,960
I need you to behave yourself

912
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,420
That boy Hae-sang Jiang I'm gonna catch him here

913
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,710
The police officer

914
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,960
Not the eldest brother

915
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,090
I said you were so obsessed with catching people out of town

916
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,720
What is the reason

917
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,090
What reason is there to arrest a murderer

918
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,850
Bad guys are what you catch

919
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,890
To grasp

920
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,930
I'm not leaving until I have that kid

921
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,520
I don't go

922
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,440
- I'm sorry. - I really can't leave

923
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,730
- Shit. - I'm really pissed off

924
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,520
- I'm not leaving. - Right

925
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,740
I just brought in the tall guy

926
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,410
what

927
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,480
You have no choice

928
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,440
hello

929
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,520
Jiang Haishang where is he

930
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,360
Eight dead people and you're gonna take them all on yourself

931
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,160
You'll be killed by the police here anyway

932
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,700
hello

933
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,160
If you tell me where Jiang Haishang is

934
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,830
I'll be in charge of requesting your return

935
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,710
immediately

936
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,590
You will be deported from Vietnam

937
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,590
I can't walk

938
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,220
- I'm not leaving. - Wait

939
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,930
Wait, stop, stop, stop

940
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,010
- Tin lane. - Move, move, move, move

941
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,060
Don't do this. Don't do this

942
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,350
To come to

943
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,060
- Come on, let's go. - Let's go

944
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,230
- Let's go. - Let's go

945
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,520
- Korea. - Korea for what

946
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,520
We were evicted, weren't we

947
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,940
We should be evicted

948
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,190
- We're being evicted? - Of course we're obeying the law

949
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,360
Help me out

950
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,950
We Korea Korea go fast

951
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,330
OK, let's go, let's go

952
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,250
- We have to go. - Are you crazy

953
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,700
Hey, aren't we here to catch Jiang Hai Shang

954
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,290
Jiang Haishang he went to Korea to see Cui Chunbai

955
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,830
- Come on. - Go, go, go

956
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,760
Oh, man, this maniac is laughing his ass off

957
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,590
- Oh, man. - Yeah

958
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,510
Hey whistle our monitor how to do this

959
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,760
Don't say

960
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,180
About a dozen guys came over with big knives like this

961
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,850
- If it wasn't for me. - You go home and rest

962
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,020
Back from the

963
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,650
I need to go back and talk to the authorities

964
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,570
- Because I'm the monitor. - Give him his luggage

965
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,980
- All right. - Let's get out of here, too

966
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,900
What the hell are you doing

967
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,990
I need you to help me carry it

968
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,030
This hand of mine is like this

969
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,080
Flying is so tiring

970
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,950
Ouch what to do

971
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,040
We're circling the west Sea crossing to see if there's any boats sneaking in

972
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
But the eldest brother

973
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,210
You're sure he's back in town

974
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,670
For sure

975
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,880
By the way, your squad leader almost died

976
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,430
The thought of that wicked criminal makes my blood boil

977
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,390
He attacked a police officer

978
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,390
Just let me see it again

979
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,070
Where are you going

980
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,620
- I'm going to the third floor. - Let's go

981
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,240
There must be no mistake about it this time

982
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,450
- The rest of the money - Jajangmyon takeout

983
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,920
I didn't send the guy who ran away at the airport

984
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,330
- Where do you want it? - Just put it there

985
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,800
The boss

986
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,100
Would you please slowly

987
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,440
I'm gonna tear this place apart for you

988
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,690
- You eat it. - Fuck

989
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,360
- And I ordered sweet and sour pork. - Then I'm out of my way

990
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,820
Order these for one person

991
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,240
How did you know I was here

992
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,870
Do you know navigation

993
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:55,990
Enter the navigation and it all comes out

994
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,290
hello

995
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,950
Sit down

996
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,290
Illegal aliens sit down

997
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,460
I've been legal for a long time

998
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,670
Ever since I came back from the knife

999
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,840
I'll just do what's legal

1000
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,380
Is it legal to take money from smugglers and put them to work

1001
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,470
- Kick your ass. - Hey, hey

1002
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,340
I don't have time right now

1003
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,220
I need you to tell me the boat route from China to South Korea

1004
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,310
I told you I haven't done it in a while

1005
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,140
What are you doing? That's rude

1006
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,900
You can't do that

1007
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,110
Long time no see

1008
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,110
to

1009
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,990
-you didn't hear me

1010
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,610
I'm not the jang I-soo I used to be

1011
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,280
now

1012
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,500
I'm not gonna let you do this to me

1013
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,540
HSS

1014
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,350
So said

1015
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,020
Did any ships come in yesterday or today

1016
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,930
Know the

1017
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,190
Hung up the

1018
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,020
Who?

1019
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,900
Nicknamed Captain One-eyed

1020
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,440
He runs all the smuggling boats from China

1021
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,820
There was a strange ship

1022
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,910
Arrived at Gongping Port early this morning

1023
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,120
- Hey, call Hong Seok. - Okay

1024
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,370
Hello, Hong Seok, where are you now

1025
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,250
Ah, not where you put the surveillance near Gongping Port

1026
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,910
Bring it all in

1027
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,130
- Yeah, wait. - There's more

1028
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,040
There are

1029
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,550
- No more. - Yeah, that's all

1030
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,340
I'm not saying you popped in

1031
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
- Bullying again. - Cut the crap

1032
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,430
I call you and I get it

1033
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,060
- Let's go. - Okay

1034
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,310
What a fucking dog I am

1035
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,900
- Did you call me? - No

1036
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,450
Oh, god damn it. Oh, god damn it

1037
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,040
Where is this?

1038
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,410
This is the parking lot behind Gongping Port

1039
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,410
There's nothing there

1040
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,170
Look at the next

1041
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,840
!

1042
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,750
The eldest brother

1043
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,880
What's the matter

1044
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:16,630
There's something weird about this guy

1045
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,680
He's blowing a tire

1046
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,050
Is that a car key

1047
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,890
- Uh, I think I found it. - Did you find it

1048
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,850
Play back the

1049
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,890
Take a look at

1050
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,770
suspended

1051
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,100
amplification

1052
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,650
Wu, 26, 8251

1053
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,280
Yeah, that's the guy

1054
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Wanted on this car

1055
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,950
This guy finally got you

1056
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,830
President of

1057
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,250
I think Kang Hae-sang came to Korea

1058
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,710
Reconnect with the killers

1059
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,710
Bring it from the outside

1060
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,920
The first two

1061
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,130
Two more when you bring the guy in front of me

1062
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,180
yes

1063
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,970
Bring it to me, alive or dead

1064
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,560
Okay, got it.

1065
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,250
We'll release the explanation to the press

1066
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,000
Get out of here

1067
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,800
hello Temasek,

1068
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,130
I told you to go back in peace

1069
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,180
You're spreading the word all over the place

1070
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,590
Are you trying to make things worse

1071
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,640
To bore me to death

1072
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,300
What's the big deal

1073
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,680
I'm trying to catch a prisoner

1074
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,810
So why are you arresting people there

1075
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,850
They have their own police there, too

1076
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,980
And you

1077
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,610
You said you'd supervise him and I got you out of here

1078
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,980
And you two got me in trouble together

1079
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,030
Also shot

1080
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,860
Ah, the gun didn't work so well that I didn't fire it too many times

1081
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,490
Ah, but the chief's handing it over to external affairs

1082
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,030
What does that mean?

1083
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,030
It's not that we managed to gather surveillance data

1084
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,790
How can you hand over the case to them now that we're close to solving it

1085
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,960
You tell me there's nothing I can do

1086
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,750
- Shit. - Why can't you always do that

1087
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,000
It's really strange

1088
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,550
ah

1089
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,470
Oh, our chief is not again

1090
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,430
You didn't read your report carefully, did you

1091
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,430
- Oh, you didn't read it? - Yeah

1092
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,010
I don't work

1093
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,560
What do you mean

1094
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,180
oh

1095
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,650
There are now four bodies recovered in Vietnam

1096
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,900
In the Philippines and Cambodia

1097
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,150
In the case of the kidnapping of Koreans

1098
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,780
The suspect is Kang Hae-sang four more cases

1099
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,070
This guy is a nut job

1100
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:46,370
So I forwarded it to foreign Affairs

1101
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,410
If these are the only ones that should be handed over to foreign Affairs

1102
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,490
Anything else?

1103
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,910
The father of Choi Yong-ki, who is now dead

1104
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,410
Because he killed his own son

1105
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,170
He hired thugs in Korea

1106
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,590
Tell them to kill Jiang Haishang and his crew

1107
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,260
But Jiang Haizang killed all those thugs

1108
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,340
Now I'm looking for Cui Chunbai

1109
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,090
At this time if Jianghai still appear

1110
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,090
Cui Chunbai will he endure

1111
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,260
- Isn't that a headache? - That's a headache

1112
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,720
Cui Chunbai hired thugs to look for them everywhere

1113
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,730
Then Seoul is a sea of blood

1114
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,560
Then we'll all be on TV

1115
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,770
On TV

1116
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,400
- Then we're all screwed. - We're all screwed

1117
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,440
- Especially brother. You're the worst. - Worst

1118
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,190
- Because you're in charge. - Because you're in charge

1119
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,240
Did you write that in the report

1120
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,490
Is it gonna get this big

1121
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,360
So please

1122
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,620
Just read the report, please, please, please

1123
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,200
I told you to read it carefully

1124
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,040
I can only block it for a week

1125
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,830
You have a week to solve this case

1126
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:37,870
A week

1127
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,000
- Got it. - Ah

1128
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,590
- A week. - A week

1129
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,130
- My mother a week. - Oh, my god

1130
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,590
alas

1131
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,780
I brought my yonky home

1132
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,110
You must be the detective

1133
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,910
is

1134
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,750
Thank you

1135

Please make sure you have a meal before you go

1136
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,250

To remarry.

1138

No children with his dead first wife

1139
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,390
That Choi Yong-ki is the only blood

1140
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,930
Understand why you hired a goon

1141
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,850
Ah really

1142
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,770
Oh, what a bunch of bastards

1143
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,020

1144
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,150

1145
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,490
Ah, what a lovely day!

1146
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,740
Can't we reimburse you for the gas

1147
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,320
You don't think that's possible

1148
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,320
Mama of

1149

1151
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,830
There are 59 months left

1152
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,710
You take care of it not to solve a crime

1153
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,710
Sacrifice it, you know

1154
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,380
You know how much I love this car

1155
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,170
- It's not a used car. - Yeah, Dong-gyun

1156

1160
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,760
The forehead is not you

1161
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,270
Keep a good eye on Cui Chunbai here

1162
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,350
You stay here and check the surveillance, okay

1163
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,400
- Okay. - Hey, give him your car keys

1164
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,600
- My car keys? - Give me yours

1165
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,690
I'm much more comfortable with this USB

1166
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,940
This is called the SUV

1167
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,200
alas

1168
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,370
I can't convince you

1169
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,050
Oh brother

1170
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,340
Hey, did you find anything

1171
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,920
Ah Jiang Hai shang this guy can be really careful

1172
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,220
I cleaned it up before I threw it away

1173
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,640
- Shit. - Didn't find anything

1174
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,390
And there's no surveillance around here

1175
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,600
Things are getting a little tricky

1176
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,250
He waited in the underground parking lot

1177
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,120
It's president Zhu's side of the Chinese triad

1178
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,960
They can be trusted

1179
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,420
If I fail this time I'll kill you first

1180
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,750
is

1181
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,760
The president is going downstairs. Get ready

1182
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,270
Yeah, I'm coming down.

1183
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,610
Know the

1184
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,940
Let's go

1185
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,160
, etc.

1186
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,200
What's wrong with these guys

1187
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,090
Tut doesn't look like anything

1188
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,730
I am Jiang Haishang

1189
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,230
You this guy

1190
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:38,870
You this bastard

1191
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,830
ahhh

1192
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,210
Give me to death

1193
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,480
I said I would come to Korea

1194
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,070
Where's my money

1195
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,160
Say hello to the president

1196
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,030
All we have to do is kill someone named Jiang Hae-sang

1197
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,630
ah

1198
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,260
Who the fuck is this

1199
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,070
You got to get over here

1200
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,630
Long time no see

1201
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,180
What the hell is wrong with the Chinese

1202
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,180
You're gonna have to give me a little more money

1203
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,980
!

1204
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,610
What circumstance

1205
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:37,280
Mama of

1206
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,280
Hong Xige is on the first floor underground

1207
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,320
Cui Chunbai was kidnapped

1208
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,080
And so on mother's

1209
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,340
First floor underground Equus Equus

1210
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,970
Fucking stop! Stop! Stop! Stop

1211
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,470
Mama of

1212
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,180
Feed stopped

1213
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,770
Mama of

1214
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,520
Big brother, are you okay

1215
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:18,900
Hey, did you see the license plate

1216
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,980
Look at the

1217
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,780
Is the camera on

1218
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,990
Open the camera

1219
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,700
Can see!

1220
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,910
This is where you're gonna lose your head tomorrow

1221
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,170
This is it

1222
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,590
$2 billion by tomorrow

1223
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,010
Keep your phone on

1224
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,590
this

1225
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,680
When did you receive it

1226
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,020
I picked it up at home last night

1227
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,940
- Go ahead and play it. - Okay

1228
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,650
- These two are brothers, aren't they? - Yes

1229
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,570
Special robber of commission killing

1230
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,080
Oh, these guys

1231
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,910
These guys are never gonna make it back

1232
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,790
These guys fled to the Philippines after they were wanted in Korea

1233
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,710
Interpol is also looking for them for murder cases involving Koreans

1234
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,130
But investigate the movement

1235
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:23,010
They had the same travel schedule as Kang hae-sang in the Philippines for about six months

1236
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,340
This looks like an abandoned factory

1237
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,300
Were there any abandoned factories near where we found the car

1238
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,180
We don't have any extra backup right now

1239
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,270
You used to

1240
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,190
Go to the police station over there and dig through it carefully

1241
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,940
Well know

1242
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,240
hello

1243
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,570
Are we gonna be enough on our own

1244
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,200
If it fails, it's us

1245
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,370
There is no time now

1246
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,080
Even though Yonki is with

1247
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,790
His dad did a lot of things wrong

1248
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,670
But they are my family

1249
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,000
Please do something to catch him

1250
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,220
What should I do

1251
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
Yeah, so that's what it means

1252
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,300
We can't send him money

1253
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,970
It's hard to track him if he's moving money to offshore accounts

1254
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:16,020
Nor does it guarantee your husband's safety

1255
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,270
Yeah, that's why it needs to be done in person

1256
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,610
I need you to lead him on

1257
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,980
And don't get excited when you talk to him

1258
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,780
We'll guide you when you call

1259
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,490
I'm really sorry for asking you to do this

1260
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,320
There's no need to be sorry

1261
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,830
There's no other way

1262
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,540
There's a phone call. Phone call

1263
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,460
Hey, come on, get ready.

1264
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,330
- Hey, be quiet. - Wait

1265
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,590
Pick up!

1266
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,680
hello

1267
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,680
I am Jiang Haishang

1268
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,770
You just do what I say and he'll be fine, okay

1269
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,390
Do you have the money

1270
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,560
I'll send you my bank account number now

1271
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,400
- Are you an idiot? - Ah

1272
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,280
Why would I give you $2 billion

1273
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,690
- Uh-huh. - Wait

1274
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,610
- Wait a minute. - You son of a bitch

1275
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,320
I gave you my money and my son is still dead

1276
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,490
I don't know if you're gonna kill my husband this time

1277
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,660
How could I possibly send you money

1278
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,080
You don't even try

1279
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,920
Then your husband will die, too

1280
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,460
Well, thank you for that

1281
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,170
What you say

1282
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,260
hello

1283
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,220
You killed my son

1284
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,180
If you kill my husband again

1285
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,430
Then you tell me who the money goes to

1286
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,430
You're going overseas anyway

1287
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,930
Isn't it

1288
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,390
I'll give you $2 million

1289
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,560
You pay me in person and you pay me in person

1290
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,900
I'll give it to you as soon as I know my husband is alive

1291
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,480
You are so grand, ma 'am

1292
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,280
good

1293
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,820
Then you'll give me $2 million tomorrow in a suitcase

1294
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,580
There are

1295
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,200
If you put a tracker in there

1296
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,660
Or some weird little stunt where I kill your husband and meet you at your house

1297
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,000
Got it!

1298
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,630
Until 1:00 a.m. tomorrow

1299
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,210
It's on Central Avenue in Sun Hill and you're driving here alone

1300
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,880
Have you got it

1301
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,010
I can't drive.

1302
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,760
I need a driver

1303
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,180
- Oh, my God. - Don't you agree

1304
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,100
Is the deal off?

1305
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,770
There can only be one driver

1306
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,430
good

1307
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,600
We'll close the deal tomorrow and save your husband...

1308
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,780
The whole family looks the same

1309
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,700
- Can I have a glass of water? - Yes

1310
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,870
good

1311
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,080
call

1312
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,040
hard

1313
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,250
A glass of water

1314
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,140
ha

1315
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,680
Wow, this old lady is no ordinary person

1316
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,020
Wow, I really want to catch that guy

1317
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,110
Hey, back to who we're sending to drive

1318
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,190
We can't he'll find out

1319
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:11,780
Who sent that

1320
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,030
Hey, tut, if a bad pie is found

1321
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,110
That could be a big deal

1322
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,290
Pretending to be married is not a bad thing

1323
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,540
This is how you start your new life

1324
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,550

First of all, Zhang Yi Zhu threw off Jiang Hai is still

Looks like he took the money and ran

Jang, an Ethnic Korean with 2 million dollars

1704
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,860
Police speculated that Jang would smuggle himself into China

1705
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,160
So they're searching the west coast

What else was I supposed to do

1716
